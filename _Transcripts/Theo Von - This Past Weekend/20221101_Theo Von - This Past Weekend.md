*  Yeah, trying to be, that's a big thing is trying to stay present for me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=136.0s)]
*  I get so caught up sometimes in thinking about everything that I need to do or things I haven't done and I will get. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=140.0s)]
*  What's that they always say? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=147.0s)]
*  You probably heard it some of the same places that we've been. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=149.0s)]
*  If you got one foot in tomorrow and one foot in yesterday, you're pissing and shitting all over the day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=151.0s)]
*  I never heard of that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. I got a few sayings for you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet we probably have a lot of the same. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=161.0s)]
*  You and I kind of connected over talking about sobriety and stuff. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=163.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=167.0s)]
*  Can you move this mic just over? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=168.0s)]
*  No, no, you don't have to move. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=170.0s)]
*  You can move, it's whatever. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=171.0s)]
*  As long as it's near your beak. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=172.0s)]
*  There we go. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=174.0s)]
*  Feel free to move it or whatever. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=175.0s)]
*  Not sure what to do with my hands. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=177.0s)]
*  Just do whatever. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=178.0s)]
*  I'm just flailing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=179.0s)]
*  There's no real way to, you know what to do. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=180.0s)]
*  I was just talking shit, man. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=181.0s)]
*  I was doing Ricky Bobby. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=182.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, so what's that been like in your life, man? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=184.0s)]
*  Man, it's just been a back and forth journey. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=188.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=191.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just been, you know, I've had some periods of recovery, you know what I'm [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=192.0s)]
*  saying? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=199.0s)]
*  And I've had some periods of sobriety, you know what I'm saying? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=200.0s)]
*  That weren't necessarily like filled with great recovery, you know what I'm saying? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=202.0s)]
*  And there's a difference, as you know. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=205.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=207.0s)]
*  Sometimes I was just kind of white knuckling it, you know, and sometimes, and then sometimes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=208.0s)]
*  I'm kind of just either on the way to, you know, things getting bad or like on the way [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=212.0s)]
*  to things back getting good. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=218.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=219.0s)]
*  At what point is like the, that, that turned forward, you know what I'm saying? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=220.0s)]
*  So to speak on the racetrack, you know? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=225.0s)]
*  But, you know, I just, I went to treatment back in, in February, you know, and it was, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=226.0s)]
*  it was good, but I wouldn't claim to be sober right now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=233.0s)]
*  Was it a 30? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=236.0s)]
*  Was it, what, what, what is it like? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=237.0s)]
*  I mean, I did 35 days of inpatient, you know what I'm saying? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=239.0s)]
*  And it was kind of weird because all the COVID protocols. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=242.0s)]
*  So like, you know how normally when you go to treatment, you can like get to go to outside [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=245.0s)]
*  meetings and all that stuff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=249.0s)]
*  You can find a sponsor that way and all that stuff. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=250.0s)]
*  We were literally like stuck in this one house, like for, it was a cold month. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=252.0s)]
*  So it was like kind of, it was a good deal to be stuck inside, but man, it got kind of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=256.0s)]
*  stir crazy in the joint for sure. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=261.0s)]
*  And was it all men in there? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=263.0s)]
*  No, there was some women, but they had like a different little house that they actually [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=265.0s)]
*  would sleep in and they had to go there like after eight o'clock, they had to go get in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=268.0s)]
*  their house. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=271.0s)]
*  And I ain't gonna say I heard tale of some, some intermingling after hours, you know what [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=272.0s)]
*  I'm saying? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=276.0s)]
*  But, yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=277.0s)]
*  I definitely wasn't on that type of vibe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=278.0s)]
*  I have, you know, in other trips to treatment, I've kind of, you know, been all about the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=281.0s)]
*  female patients. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=286.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, they get some real, yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=288.0s)]
*  Especially man, if I'm coming off of pills, I want to pet something, you know? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=291.0s)]
*  Man, well it's just when anytime, you know, you, we feel that hole, that internal hole [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=294.0s)]
*  with external anything, you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=298.0s)]
*  And so it's like, man, if you take away what I, what my primary like tool I was using to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=300.0s)]
*  try to fill that hole, even though it was just ultimately making the hole bigger. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=306.0s)]
*  But if you just, if you take that, whatever thing I was using, I might have to find something [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=309.0s)]
*  else. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=313.0s)]
*  It might be cheeseburgers, you know what I'm saying? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=314.0s)]
*  It might be gambling, might be women, you know, might be men, whatever. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah, damn bro. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=319.0s)]
*  I know I haven't been there yet, but. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=320.0s)]
*  Me either. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=322.0s)]
*  Dude, you hit me with the wrong eight ball. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=323.0s)]
*  I'll fucking, I might meet some young fella, bro. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=325.0s)]
*  I ain't meeting no old dude though. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=328.0s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=330.0s)]
*  Man, I just, I don't know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=331.0s)]
*  I just never had that inclination. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=333.0s)]
*  If I was, if I was gay, I would just be gay. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=334.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=336.0s)]
*  It wouldn't really, I mean, I can't say that growing up, it might not have been like a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=337.0s)]
*  kind of a tormenting type thing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=341.0s)]
*  Growing up in the rural South, you know, like in the eighties and nineties. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=343.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, you had to be real secret gay back then. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=345.0s)]
*  But to be honest with you, like being a white rapper from LaGrange, Georgia, you know what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=347.0s)]
*  I'm saying? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=352.0s)]
*  It was, it was some of the same type of like, you know, I don't want to say oppression, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=353.0s)]
*  but just ridicule that you faced, you know? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=357.0s)]
*  I never even thought about that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=362.0s)]
*  But I mean, people, yeah, people probably really would have like, think you're trying [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=363.0s)]
*  to blacken up or something like that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=367.0s)]
*  Well, it was kind of like not really accepted by either side. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=369.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=371.0s)]
*  Because where I grew up, LaGrange, Georgia, shout out to Trap County, but it's pretty [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=372.0s)]
*  much 50% black, 50% white, you know what I'm saying? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=376.0s)]
*  And so yeah, definitely the white side wasn't really too, you know what I'm saying? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=379.0s)]
*  Like open-minded to the prospect of me being a rapper at that time. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=383.0s)]
*  But you know, the hood side, the black folks really wasn't too receptive either. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=387.0s)]
*  It's not like they were just waiting with open arms as far as that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=391.0s)]
*  Like come be a rapper over here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=394.0s)]
*  Well, you were early into, I mean, you were like, I mean, you were dang, you were like [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=396.0s)]
*  the dang Neil Armstrong out there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=399.0s)]
*  You was like one of the first fucking. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=402.0s)]
*  First man on the moon, yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=404.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=405.0s)]
*  He was like one of the first wiggas on the moon kind of in a way, you know? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=406.0s)]
*  No, I mean, as far as like, you know, a country boy from the South, you know, or. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=409.0s)]
*  Did they have that? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=413.0s)]
*  They didn't have it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=414.0s)]
*  No, and that's been part of the journey, like, is there was no reference point, you know [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=415.0s)]
*  what I'm saying? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=419.0s)]
*  I grew up off like outcast. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=420.0s)]
*  I was heavily influenced by outcast goody mob, the organized noise, the dungeon family. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=421.0s)]
*  So that was the closest thing because they were the first people to kind of like rep [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=426.0s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=429.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=430.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=431.0s)]
*  Specifically Atlanta. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=432.0s)]
*  But for me, I was brought up in the country about 60 miles down the road from Atlanta. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=433.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, there was in just being a white boy or whatever, there was definitely nobody [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=438.0s)]
*  for me to look at, even though I did learn from a lot of other white rappers. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=442.0s)]
*  It was successful, starting with the Beastie Boys, you know, going on to like Everlast. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=446.0s)]
*  House of Pain, even third base to some degree. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=449.0s)]
*  But then Eminem, you know what I'm saying? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=452.0s)]
*  It was right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=454.0s)]
*  Eminem was about a year before me, you know what I'm saying? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=455.0s)]
*  And when he came, I was like, that's perfection right there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=458.0s)]
*  The way that was executed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=461.0s)]
*  So like, but I knew, you know, shout out to Vanilla Ice. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=462.0s)]
*  He's actually my dog. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=467.0s)]
*  Like I've done shows with him and we've had a ball, but he's a cool cat. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=469.0s)]
*  I've met him a few times. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=473.0s)]
*  He's a good dude, man. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=474.0s)]
*  But at that time, it was like after his Ice Ice Baby Rain, kind of like when he sold like 15 million albums, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=476.0s)]
*  which you can't take. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=482.0s)]
*  Everybody was listening. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=483.0s)]
*  Everybody was jamming Ice Ice Baby. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=484.0s)]
*  I don't care what nobody says now. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=486.0s)]
*  Oh, even Vietnamese were like, Ice Ice Baby. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=487.0s)]
*  Everybody had it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=490.0s)]
*  Hey, you know, projects, albums don't sell 15 million. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=492.0s)]
*  Singles don't sell 30 million or whatever it sold without everybody liking it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=495.0s)]
*  Everybody liked that shit. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=500.0s)]
*  Everybody got the big pants. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=502.0s)]
*  When you really hit, when you affect people's, you know, when you go through their ears and come out their clothing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=503.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember so many white boys now. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=508.0s)]
*  I wasn't quite old enough to attempt a stunt like this, but I remember white boys getting even like the little haircut that he had. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=510.0s)]
*  And it was just like, dang, man, you're so cool. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=515.0s)]
*  You got a vanilla ice haircut. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=519.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=520.0s)]
*  But that wasn't really something I was on. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=521.0s)]
*  But just to keep going, there was some kind of discrepancies with his story about where he was from and what he was representing as far as being a hood kid or whatever. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=523.0s)]
*  And so after that, I kind of just learned it was like a lull. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=532.0s)]
*  It was like a five or six year period where there was nobody was checking for white rappers. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=535.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=539.0s)]
*  But I knew like you just got to represent who you are. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=540.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=543.0s)]
*  Like everything that's in the spirit of hip hop and where hip hop comes from and like the principles, you know, the guiding principles are based on like, you know, just truly, truly, accurately, honestly represent who you are, where you come from and what it was like there until your story. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=544.0s)]
*  Honestly, you know what I'm saying? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=559.0s)]
*  And that's that's gonna work. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=560.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=562.0s)]
*  If you do it and you figure out a way to make it dope. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=563.0s)]
*  And so I had developed that within myself because like my first raps I ever wrote like in 1992, like at my mom's kitchen table in the ninth grade were like was just rolling in the bins, though, letting the bass drop when five motherfuckers rolled by on a drop top. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=565.0s)]
*  Like, you know, talking about like boys in the hood. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=579.0s)]
*  I didn't know how to and that was part of the what you're talking about, like the whole journey of me trying to figure out how within using hip hop is the is the outlet expressing who I was and where I came from, you know, growing up on a farm. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=583.0s)]
*  You know, saying a LaGrange. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=596.0s)]
*  Yeah, farm, some of the animals got gold chains on. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=597.0s)]
*  I just I never cared about music. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=600.0s)]
*  Music was all around me. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=603.0s)]
*  I had an older brother that loved like metal bands like Iron Maiden. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=604.0s)]
*  Big shout out to Russ. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=608.0s)]
*  Iron Maiden's his favorite band, all time band. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=609.0s)]
*  So he was into that type of music. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=611.0s)]
*  Then I had my oldest brother, Jay. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=613.0s)]
*  Shout out to Jay. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=614.0s)]
*  He liked like Parliament funk, Camelot, you know, George Clamp, all that kind of stuff. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=615.0s)]
*  He had P funk. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=620.0s)]
*  And then my dad likes like throwback country, you know, traditional country. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=621.0s)]
*  And my mama just likes to dance. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=625.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=626.0s)]
*  So music was all around, but it just didn't speak to me. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=627.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=630.0s)]
*  I didn't care about it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=631.0s)]
*  It was just something in the background. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=632.0s)]
*  When I heard them, somebody say, hey, we want some put. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=634.0s)]
*  When I heard that, I was like, what is that? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=640.0s)]
*  Then when I heard Boys in the Hood, when I heard Too Short, I was like, what the fuck is this? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=641.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=645.0s)]
*  Maybe you didn't even know you had that in you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=646.0s)]
*  It just spoke. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=647.0s)]
*  I knew it was good. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=648.0s)]
*  When I heard Brass Monkey by the Beastie Boys, I heard it and it was just like, man, this is going to be a part of my life forever. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=649.0s)]
*  I just feel it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=655.0s)]
*  It just speaks to me. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=656.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=657.0s)]
*  The raw expression, the 808 drum. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=658.0s)]
*  Man, it was a lot to do with that 808, honestly, man, for real, because that wasn't really a part. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=661.0s)]
*  The boom bap was kind of like the New York wave of hip hop. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=666.0s)]
*  When the West Coast finally got its turn, it was like Too Short and W.A. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=669.0s)]
*  That 808 drum was rattling. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=673.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=675.0s)]
*  Dude, I remember when some of that shit came through our neighborhood, because I probably grew up, I didn't grow up country. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=676.0s)]
*  I just grew up in a rural kind of white area. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=682.0s)]
*  Because Louisiana doesn't get a redneck vibe. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=684.0s)]
*  Louisiana is just, it's a lot of like grandchildren of pirates. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=687.0s)]
*  You got Cajun people, you got a lot of mixed, kind of like a lot of yellow skin, kind of like light skinned black dudes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=691.0s)]
*  You got some kind of dark. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=698.0s)]
*  Like Creole type. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=700.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got some people just fucking, you don't know what color they are, bro. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=701.0s)]
*  They don't even know. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=704.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=705.0s)]
*  No, Louisiana is a different kind of place now. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=706.0s)]
*  They got a lot of pirates, grandchildren of pirates and shit like that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=708.0s)]
*  Shout out to old Broadnecks. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=711.0s)]
*  There's a country rapper just doing his thing right now that he's from Monroe, Louisiana. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=713.0s)]
*  And they call him Broadnecks? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=717.0s)]
*  Broadnecks. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=718.0s)]
*  That's his last name. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=719.0s)]
*  Oh, Broadnecks. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=720.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's John Broadnecks or whatever. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=721.0s)]
*  But he's representing Louisiana. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=722.0s)]
*  He's got that Louisiana flavor about the way he does his thing. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=724.0s)]
*  But it's like kind of country white boy, Louisiana type flavor, which I wouldn't call it country country, farm type country. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=727.0s)]
*  It's just more like swampy. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=735.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=737.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=738.0s)]
*  So you were just trying to express yourself, really. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=743.0s)]
*  And then it was just, it's kind of like a puzzle, too. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=744.0s)]
*  You're just trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together and make it seem cool, ultimately. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=746.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=750.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, there are some pretty interesting dynamics to rural life, you know what I'm saying? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=751.0s)]
*  That maybe some people just aren't typically aware of, you know what I'm saying? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=756.0s)]
*  But just how to, it's not, now I'm not trying to say that violence in a community and all that stuff is cool. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=760.0s)]
*  It's a terrible thing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=766.0s)]
*  But ultimately, if you're representing yourself as a person that made it, persevered and made it through that, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=767.0s)]
*  and that's your testimony of like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=772.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=774.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=775.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=776.0s)]
*  And it's hard, you know what I'm saying? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=777.0s)]
*  But basically, I just, I was like, well, this is it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=778.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=781.0s)]
*  I got to just give it what I have to offer, you know what I'm saying? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=782.0s)]
*  And I just told the story of what I'd been through and what my life had been like. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=784.0s)]
*  And there was enough people that related to it for me to be able to keep doing this as a job [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=790.0s)]
*  without having to get a real job for 20 something years, you know what I'm saying? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=795.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, everybody. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=798.0s)]
*  I'm not fucking, it was crazy, man. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=799.0s)]
*  When you hit the scene, it was just... [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=801.0s)]
*  It was special, man. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=803.0s)]
*  It was special, man. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=804.0s)]
*  What was some of the pressure of that? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=806.0s)]
*  Like, because, yeah, they just didn't have anything like you. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=808.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, you're like kind of mixing two worlds. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=813.0s)]
*  You're probably not like, yeah, maybe some, I could imagine maybe especially where you're from, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=817.0s)]
*  some white people could see like, oh, this is too black for us. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=822.0s)]
*  And the hood, the hood, you're never, the hood fucking, you're never hood enough. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=827.0s)]
*  Even if you, like, the hood will always be like, you never hood enough. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=832.0s)]
*  You know, it's like there's always that even in the black community. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=835.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, when you just are being you, you know what I'm saying? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=838.0s)]
*  Like, and I never compromised me, you know what I'm saying? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=842.0s)]
*  I really didn't. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=844.0s)]
*  I never did. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=845.0s)]
*  There were some things that I might have done that I would have preferred to have highlighted [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=846.0s)]
*  other aspects of who I really am. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=850.0s)]
*  But any, there's nothing I did that wasn't, you know, a certain shade of like who I am. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=852.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, truthfully. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=857.0s)]
*  And so it's kind of like just being at peace. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=858.0s)]
*  You know, I went through so much when I was younger as far as like trying to really just figure out like, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=861.0s)]
*  because I mean, to say that people didn't support me in my, my, my pursuit of this, of rap music, hip hop as a career [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=865.0s)]
*  would be a pretty big understatement. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=874.0s)]
*  You know, I would say more like people didn't even kind of like stop chuckling behind my back until I had actually like, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=876.0s)]
*  I was on MTV, you know what I'm saying? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=882.0s)]
*  So I was well accustomed and adjusted to like people not, not supporting me, you know, to have to be that, that, that self propelling, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=884.0s)]
*  you know, type deal. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=893.0s)]
*  Well, that happens, I think with a lot of like, I remember when I was a comedian, like it was like, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=894.0s)]
*  until like you, somebody sees you on something, you are just some dude, you are like some guy that don't want to get a real job. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=899.0s)]
*  And everybody just thinks you're foolish. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=908.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=910.0s)]
*  Like everybody just thinks at the end of the day, because, you know, I mean, I'm a creative person, you know what I'm saying? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=911.0s)]
*  And I played football and that's like the big deal, like where I grew up, like high school football, you know, it's like Friday Night Lights type of deal for sure. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=917.0s)]
*  You know, I was pretty good at football. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=924.0s)]
*  My best friend, Steve Hernan, shout out to him. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=926.0s)]
*  He was great at football. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=928.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=929.0s)]
*  He was one of the top 100 highest recruited players in the country. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=930.0s)]
*  Went to Georgia, was all SEC, played in the NFL for seven years. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=934.0s)]
*  But so I love football. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=937.0s)]
*  Football is my first love, to be honest with you. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=939.0s)]
*  And it was interesting because music was actually his first love. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=941.0s)]
*  And we ended up living vicariously through one another. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=944.0s)]
*  But when I saw how I was like, man, he's so he's what the deal deal is. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=947.0s)]
*  And I'm just not quite that, you know what I'm saying? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=953.0s)]
*  So what can I be great, great at? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=956.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=959.0s)]
*  I had never bumped my head on the ceiling as far as my potential with football pretty early. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=960.0s)]
*  But I was like, man, I really think I can do the music thing. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=965.0s)]
*  I just the first time I ever sat down to write a rap, I was like, man, I just got a knack for this, for just putting words together, making them rhyme and just being clever. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=968.0s)]
*  And just I don't know, I just always somewhere deep down in my heart, even though I tried to do other things because it wasn't easy. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=975.0s)]
*  Like I said, there was no acceptance for it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=983.0s)]
*  We all crave being accepted, you know what I'm saying? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=985.0s)]
*  On some level or another by the people around us. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=988.0s)]
*  And nobody was really my closest friends like Big Steve, like he he believed in me 100 percent. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=990.0s)]
*  You know, I'd be up at University of Georgia, ended up moving up to Athens, Georgia, and being up there like, you know, freestyling after football games and stuff. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=996.0s)]
*  And like all the guys on the team, you know what I'm saying? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1005.0s)]
*  Just like my Andy's what they call me back then. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1007.0s)]
*  And it's like, Andy, flow for one more time, flow for one more time. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1010.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1013.0s)]
*  Like, it's just all those guys being up there and just being like. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1014.0s)]
*  That's before they had iPod. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1017.0s)]
*  You was the iPod. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1018.0s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1019.0s)]
*  And like I as far as battling, like everybody would try to go back home and find the best rapper in their little area and get them to come up. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1020.0s)]
*  Get him out, bring his little ass out of the wheelbarrow. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1026.0s)]
*  He's going to serve your boy. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1028.0s)]
*  He's going to serve your boy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1029.0s)]
*  And then, you know what I'm saying? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1030.0s)]
*  It just wasn't happening. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1031.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1032.0s)]
*  So I would sit there and literally go back and just write and write, you know what I'm saying? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1033.0s)]
*  Because I've never been a freestyler because I didn't grow up around other people rapping. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1036.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1039.0s)]
*  So people develop that freestyling ability, I think, when they're in groups of people rapping. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1040.0s)]
*  But it was a long time before I was around other people that were like seriously even, you know, rapping, putting words together like that. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1044.0s)]
*  So when you like. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1051.0s)]
*  So how did you start to take off? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1052.0s)]
*  How did your career, how did it go from that where you're just kind of rapping and becoming like acclaimed amongst people in Georgia amongst like after parties and stuff like that before social media? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1054.0s)]
*  How did you get to that next space? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1066.0s)]
*  That's a good question because I always tell people now like this era the way it is, I don't even I wouldn't know where to start telling somebody how to get on. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1068.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? How to make it happen. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1076.0s)]
*  You know, just when people ask me for advice, I'm like, look, just pray that this is what God wants for you if it's what you really want. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1077.0s)]
*  You know, and burn bridges like I don't mean burn bridges in terms of relationships, but in the pursuit of this thing, if you leave yourself out, and I know you know this as far as like the comedy thing, too. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1083.0s)]
*  If you leave yourself out at some point, you're going to take one of them, you know, saying because it's tough. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1094.0s)]
*  You know, so I I burnt some bridges as coach of Georgia, Kirby Smart would say, burn the boats. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1099.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1107.0s)]
*  Like there was just nowhere for me to go other than this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1108.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? If this didn't happen, I shudder to think what might have been a certain number of years in especially. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1111.0s)]
*  It's like once you get up to like 25, 20 people are like, what's going on? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1119.0s)]
*  You're not in college. You don't have this degree. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1123.0s)]
*  You don't have a child. You don't have a family. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1125.0s)]
*  People are like, you better show something. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1127.0s)]
*  You know, and my best friend was like playing football at Georgia. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1129.0s)]
*  And you know, he was on the way to the NFL and it was honestly it hurt me so bad because I loved him so much and was so supportive of him. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1132.0s)]
*  And I now believe that that was God preparing me, you know, because like I learned how to not be a hater. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1138.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1144.0s)]
*  And a lot of people probably looked at me, definitely looked at me as like a hindrance on him even. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1146.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1150.0s)]
*  Like, like, you know, Steve Beard, if you know, if he just get away from old Andy, you know what I'm saying? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1151.0s)]
*  Like kind of looked at me as like the loser, but he never bought into that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1156.0s)]
*  He never subscribed to that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1159.0s)]
*  He was always like, tell people like, you know, he gonna do something big. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1161.0s)]
*  I don't know when it's gonna be or what exactly is gonna be. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1165.0s)]
*  Maybe this music thing. Maybe not. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1167.0s)]
*  He gonna do something big. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1169.0s)]
*  You know, he always believed in me, never blinked. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1170.0s)]
*  And then had you had that kind of belief before in your life? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1173.0s)]
*  Had you had someone you feel like believe in you that like like that? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1176.0s)]
*  Like, no, no, other than him, honestly. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1179.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not that my my parents and his parents, they love, you know what I'm saying? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1183.0s)]
*  But it was like it was just so far beyond their realm of comprehension, you know, that it might even be remotely feasible for something like that to happen, especially being a white boy and coming from down there. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1188.0s)]
*  But I just always looked at it like this. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1199.0s)]
*  I always had like this innate feeling like, hey, I'm just I'm gonna do something special. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1200.0s)]
*  I'm special. I'm different. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1204.0s)]
*  You know, not in a bad way because I've never not been humble, but just like, you know, just really feeling like there's just something out there waiting for me that I just got to find it and pluck it out of the sky or whatever. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1205.0s)]
*  And so I just basically like I didn't ever think sometimes I felt like, you know, it was going to be something like because my my fallback plan was being a high school history teacher and a high school football coach. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1217.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. I'd love to see you fucking remix. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1234.0s)]
*  I love remix the Civil War dog. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1237.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love to see that. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1241.0s)]
*  Fucking get, get, get, get, get. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1243.0s)]
*  I got a crazy theory on that too. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1244.0s)]
*  I'm like, you know, like, you know, when you have like the feeling this is a tangential. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1246.0s)]
*  No worries. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1250.0s)]
*  I think people listening just because people right now are stacking shelves, they're driving Amazon and fucking beating their spouse. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1251.0s)]
*  They don't know what they're about. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1257.0s)]
*  Y'all rock steady out there. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1259.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1260.0s)]
*  But as far as like, man, I just I feel like in the future, like, I think, you know how we get that feeling like everybody says like, you just know something's in the room with you or you like hear something crazy or whatever. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1261.0s)]
*  I've kind of developed a theory on this and maybe you mean I like to hear your thoughts on it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1272.0s)]
*  So I think that in the future, you know, like how in history class now, you know, like we go through books and look at pictures and listen to speeches or whatever of these that mark these certain, you know, historical events or whatever. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1277.0s)]
*  I think in the future, the reason that we hear these weird things and like it's like these, I don't know what you would call it, not ghosts. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1290.0s)]
*  But like some of them probably are mistaken for ghosts. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1298.0s)]
*  I think in the future, time travel is actually possible and people come back and like can actually be present. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1301.0s)]
*  But it's like in a different dimension so they can like see it, but they're not really present. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1308.0s)]
*  They're like in danger and actually be on the battlefield at Gettysburg and stuff like that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1311.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1316.0s)]
*  That's just something that. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1317.0s)]
*  So you're saying like in the future, you could have like Gettysburg. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1318.0s)]
*  Yeah, basically a whole class, a whole field trip could go. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1321.0s)]
*  They're just sitting there looking at the battle actually taking place. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1323.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1325.0s)]
*  But see, they're not the whole background. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1326.0s)]
*  Right. They don't know that they're there. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1328.0s)]
*  And the whole. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1329.0s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1330.0s)]
*  The people that are fighting the battle don't. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1331.0s)]
*  But like the whole back to the future thing and like about like, you know, messing it up and all that stuff. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1332.0s)]
*  That's not that's not a threat because you're like in a different dimension. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1336.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1340.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1341.0s)]
*  So you can observe it, but you're not actually present. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1342.0s)]
*  But man, I really think this like you threw some like secret drywall or something like they don't know. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1344.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just you're in a different some kind of different, you know, like, dude, I used to think, look, I love this shit. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1349.0s)]
*  I used to think that so people had CDs and eight, you know, this and that people had. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1355.0s)]
*  I always thought that they were going to come out with a dashboard that was like some sort of a screen. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1360.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1367.0s)]
*  And in a vehicle and you would put it, you would just press in whatever you want to listen to. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1368.0s)]
*  And then like Bubba Spark would come and perform on your dashboard like a hologram. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1372.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1378.0s)]
*  I always thought that that would be the next thing. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1379.0s)]
*  Like if you wanted to watch ACDC, you would just type it in and then damn, they would come out there and actually you're just driving in there right there. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1381.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's like the next step in the evolution of just music videos and like streaming period, though. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1388.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1395.0s)]
*  It's probably not. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1396.0s)]
*  It's probably because they have those holograms like a Tupac. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1397.0s)]
*  I remember that was like that thing. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1400.0s)]
*  So, I mean, we technology, if you went back 100 years from from this, like, so if you went back to 1922, somebody mind. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1401.0s)]
*  I mean, but like so much more than you would if you went from 1922 to 1822. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1408.0s)]
*  Right. They wouldn't be that shocked. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1413.0s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1414.0s)]
*  Like the world didn't change that much. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1415.0s)]
*  That's a wheel, bitch. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1417.0s)]
*  But that's just the evidence of the fact that technology is evolving at a much more rapid rate. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1418.0s)]
*  So imagine 100 years from now. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1423.0s)]
*  We can't comprehend it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1425.0s)]
*  We literally cannot comprehend it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1427.0s)]
*  And so, dude, you know what? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1429.0s)]
*  Somebody was telling me about comp. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1431.0s)]
*  I was talking with someone about this and they had. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1432.0s)]
*  Are you talking about you were talking about a guy with a ladder and you another guy said, hey, one day I think we could get to the moon. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1436.0s)]
*  Yeah. And this dude could only think, no, we can't get to we can maybe get to the top of a tree or something. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1446.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1451.0s)]
*  But I'm not doing a good job explaining. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1452.0s)]
*  Anyway, it was something I learned. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1454.0s)]
*  I do that same thing all the time. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1455.0s)]
*  It's like we can't comprehend things like it's like we don't have the words for it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1457.0s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1461.0s)]
*  Right. And it's beyond our brain even because we're still thinking within the limitations of three dimensional thing. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1462.0s)]
*  This world. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1467.0s)]
*  What are the hardest things I ever saw was like the way I forget I was watching something. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1468.0s)]
*  This is probably 10, 15 years ago, but they were explaining the difference because mathematics is like proven that there's like nine dimensions. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1474.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1481.0s)]
*  Like we just aren't aware of them or haven't discovered them or figured out how to interpret them or, you know, or just see them or be president and whatever the case is. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1482.0s)]
*  But so like, you know, if we lived in a two dimensional world, my finger coming at you would just look like a dot. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1490.0s)]
*  But because it's a three dimensional world, you can see all sides of my finger. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1500.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1504.0s)]
*  But imagine this if there was some being God, perhaps some people might call that being they could do time the same way. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1505.0s)]
*  Who's to say? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1514.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1516.0s)]
*  You know, I see what you're saying. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1517.0s)]
*  Yeah, like look all around time like, you know, the time thing. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1519.0s)]
*  This is right. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1522.0s)]
*  Right. Because time for us just flows like this. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1523.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1525.0s)]
*  But what if some dudes go all around? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1526.0s)]
*  Yeah, this would be like, OK, this is like looking at it from looking at 2022 from 2014. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1528.0s)]
*  OK, now I'm gonna go look at 2022 from 2036. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1533.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1536.0s)]
*  So I don't. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1537.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if there's other realms we're going to crack. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1538.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, I feel like that has to be the next thing. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1541.0s)]
*  You would have to believe that's what God would be. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1543.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1545.0s)]
*  Because I remember when I was real little, you know, my pops, I wouldn't necessarily call him like an intellectual, but he's a pretty smart guy. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1546.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1554.0s)]
*  And he would say, I'd be like trying to get him to explain God to me, you know, like in all these. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1555.0s)]
*  Because I was a very inquisitive kid and he'd just be like, it's just beyond our realm of comprehension. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1560.0s)]
*  You know, that would shut me up every time. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1565.0s)]
*  You just can't even understand it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1567.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1569.0s)]
*  Like, and honestly, like, that's the truth. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1570.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1572.0s)]
*  Like, whatever it is we're talking about, whatever might be or could be or could we could evolve into, it's just hard to know. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1573.0s)]
*  But I was listening to something the other day. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1580.0s)]
*  I watch a lot of YouTube videos. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1583.0s)]
*  I'll go down to YouTube. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1585.0s)]
*  I love that one with you and Randy Aikens. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1586.0s)]
*  Oh, Rodney Aikens. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1590.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1591.0s)]
*  Shout out to Rodney, man. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1592.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1593.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1594.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1595.0s)]
*  I like Reckon. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1596.0s)]
*  I like Right. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1597.0s)]
*  I really love him. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1598.0s)]
*  He might reckon. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1599.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1600.0s)]
*  I like Reckon, man. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1601.0s)]
*  But I really, really did like Right. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1602.0s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1603.0s)]
*  Nah, that was a pretty good example. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1604.0s)]
*  To me, that's something I don't normally do on the countryside. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1607.0s)]
*  That's like country music. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1612.0s)]
*  We rap on it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1614.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1615.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1616.0s)]
*  I feel like I do country hip hop. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1617.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1618.0s)]
*  Really, it should be called hip hop country because hip hop is the first thing that I've, you know what I'm saying? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1619.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1625.0s)]
*  I represent all things that I am. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1626.0s)]
*  I'm white, you know what I'm saying, or whatever. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1628.0s)]
*  I'm country hip hop, but I'd say I'm hip hop before I'm anything. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1630.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1634.0s)]
*  Because it's just that hip hop music and culture has done so much for me. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1635.0s)]
*  I'm so grateful to you all over the world. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1641.0s)]
*  But I just want to complete land on that thought about Right. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1643.0s)]
*  Some guys like Big Smough, Colt Ford. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1650.0s)]
*  I would say those are kind of the forefathers of that sound. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1653.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1656.0s)]
*  Where it's really just more like country music just with some rapping on it. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1657.0s)]
*  And it's dope. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1660.0s)]
*  And that song is incredible. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1661.0s)]
*  Shout out to Nor Gordon, who worked on writing that song with us. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1663.0s)]
*  And Rodney, I had just come to Nashville. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1668.0s)]
*  That was kind of like the 2012 area when Florida Georgia Line was first blowing up and the TV show Nashville was on. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1671.0s)]
*  Nashville was kind of like getting that first like, oh, it's like becoming like an international like cool place. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1679.0s)]
*  It was putting this little skirt on for everybody. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1685.0s)]
*  It wasn't just Redneck Hollywood anymore. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1687.0s)]
*  And so like, you know, and I came up here and, you know, Rodney, he took a chance on, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1689.0s)]
*  It wasn't the cool now like this genre bending collaborations. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1696.0s)]
*  Yeah, now you got like Morgan Wallen, Lil Durk. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1701.0s)]
*  It's kind of like it's just like the norm. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1704.0s)]
*  Everything's real mixed up. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1709.0s)]
*  But back then it was, you know, it was actually kind of rolling the dice, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1710.0s)]
*  With your career to try something like that and to step over that line. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1715.0s)]
*  And so I'm appreciative of the people that did because, you know, country always sought to build a bridge between people, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1718.0s)]
*  Between hip hop and country, the hood and you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1725.0s)]
*  Because lower class people just aren't that different. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1729.0s)]
*  That's the thing I was thinking about next. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1731.0s)]
*  I always wonder why don't I feel like poor because as a poor white kid, the first thing you wanted to be was black. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1734.0s)]
*  I felt like, yeah, I mean, I was a poor white when I well, I'm not a poor white kid anymore. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1744.0s)]
*  I'm not a kid. Yeah. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1748.0s)]
*  You know, and I have some of the times I hate haven't even made any money because I'm not fucking poor anymore. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1749.0s)]
*  I can't I can't have the same feelings I had. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1755.0s)]
*  There's something about that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1758.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1759.0s)]
*  See, those say I kind of like being poor. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1760.0s)]
*  At least I know what my friends here for. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1762.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1764.0s)]
*  My mom used to say she would say if you don't have anything, they can't take anything away from you. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1765.0s)]
*  She would say that's right. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1771.0s)]
*  And it was kind of like you really be about some shit when you got nothing else. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1772.0s)]
*  You got nothing to fucking lose. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1776.0s)]
*  You don't care when death don't even seem like that bad of an alternative. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1778.0s)]
*  Sue me, fuck me, whatever you want to do, man. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1781.0s)]
*  Ain't got nothing going to get you. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1783.0s)]
*  It don't matter. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1785.0s)]
*  It don't matter. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1786.0s)]
*  But for some reason, yeah, when I think I've related so much, I feel like to poor black kids when I was young. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1787.0s)]
*  And I think it's also just a thing like we have Miss Pat on. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1793.0s)]
*  She says she's like black people make things cool, she said. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1797.0s)]
*  And I don't know if I agree about that with everything. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1801.0s)]
*  Something for sure. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1803.0s)]
*  You know, black folks are creators. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1804.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, there's nothing that you could really if you look at, you know, I mean, all that's been created by black folks in America. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1806.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot when it comes to art. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1813.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1815.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1816.0s)]
*  Well, they got more art kind of built into them, you know, even I feel like if you punch a black dude, a cool sound comes out of them. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1817.0s)]
*  You know, it's like but I just I'm always a little bit fascinated by what it is, even in my own life, why I felt like I related to poor. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1823.0s)]
*  You know what I think, though? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1833.0s)]
*  I think a lot of times raw creativity comes from poverty and oppression, you know what I'm saying? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1834.0s)]
*  From just the struggle, you know what I'm saying? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1841.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I like the or because poor black people always had a when I was young, they didn't even have any rich black people. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1843.0s)]
*  They only had like Michael Irvin. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1850.0s)]
*  Bill Cosby. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1851.0s)]
*  Yeah, Bill Cosby and maybe like the Dallas Cowboys, it felt like. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1852.0s)]
*  And, you know, they probably weren't even that rich. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1856.0s)]
*  Like, you know, what you would what we thought was rich at that time, probably we wouldn't. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1859.0s)]
*  They probably were making like half a million dollars a year or something, you know, or maybe because contracts weren't even that lucrative back then. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1863.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1869.0s)]
*  No, the producers were making all the money back then. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1870.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1871.0s)]
*  They really had them boxed up. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1872.0s)]
*  But even like I remember if they had like like the best job a black person could get in our town was probably like our teacher, you know, like that room. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1873.0s)]
*  This was in Covington, Louisiana. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1882.0s)]
*  So it's like coaches. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1883.0s)]
*  Yeah, coaches. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1885.0s)]
*  Now you see a lot more like I went to the first black doctor. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1886.0s)]
*  I like about maybe seven months ago, I go into the doctor and it was a black guy. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1891.0s)]
*  I'd never been. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1895.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1897.0s)]
*  And I didn't mean anything, but I know there's black doctors, but I just had never been in the one. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1898.0s)]
*  And I'm like, is this going to I was like, and then I'm thinking black people their whole life been going to white doctors. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1901.0s)]
*  What do they think about that? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1907.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, just growing up in like because, you know, this is the south is different than the rest of the country. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1908.0s)]
*  Like, there's black folks in pretty much every major city. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1914.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1917.0s)]
*  The difference in the south and the rest of the country is you go an hour outside into the country in the south and it's still a bunch of black folks. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1918.0s)]
*  You go an hour outside of like Chicago, Minneapolis, you know what I'm saying, or Milwaukee. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1925.0s)]
*  And there's really not any black folks. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1930.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1932.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1933.0s)]
*  So to speak. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1934.0s)]
*  And so I just I think like Atlanta, especially like with Atlanta, having spent that's kind of like my that's my home major city. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1935.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1942.0s)]
*  I lived in Atlanta for that's where I live now. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1943.0s)]
*  You know, it's like February started a damn city over there. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1945.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just, you know, and I always tell people when I bump into like black folks in Idaho or something, just have never been around a lot of other black folks. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1948.0s)]
*  I say you go live in Atlanta for two years. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1956.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1958.0s)]
*  And go experience a city that's black city, not just in terms of like the metro population being a lot of black folks, but also the infrastructure. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1959.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1967.0s)]
*  The mayor's black. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1968.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1969.0s)]
*  The city council, you know, a lot of the policemen, the sheriff, you know what I'm saying? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1970.0s)]
*  It's just it's that kind of city. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1974.0s)]
*  And I tell white people in those same areas that, you know, because you ever notice like a lot of those like hate groups and stuff will be like in Idaho and you know the militias and all that stuff. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1976.0s)]
*  And I'm like, there are no black. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1985.0s)]
*  When have you ever been around black people to know you have a problem with them? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1987.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1990.0s)]
*  Like, you know, but I tell I tell, you know, white folks the same thing. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1991.0s)]
*  Go live in Atlanta for a couple years. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1994.0s)]
*  See what it's like to be for that shoe to be on the other foot. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1995.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1998.0s)]
*  Other foot. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=1999.0s)]
*  And you should experience that. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2000.0s)]
*  You know, because I think that that just evolves your perspective to a point where you might be a little more sympathetic and empathetic of somebody. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2002.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2009.0s)]
*  If you really just looked at the world the way they had been forced to see it, you know. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2010.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2015.0s)]
*  I just I guess I was really just yeah, I'm just thinking about like why I guess why I guess maybe it's a lot of music. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2017.0s)]
*  I wonder what it was that made me relate when I was real young. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2026.0s)]
*  I was in this, you know, it was hip hop, man. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2029.0s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you, you know, I'm saying hip hop, hip hop shaped a lot of hearts and changed a lot of potentially racist, you know, hearts. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2032.0s)]
*  Like I would say like broke that cycle and families in the south, you know, a lot of because I just knew people that would otherwise I'd be like, man, that joke is racist. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2042.0s)]
*  But I just love Tupac so much they just couldn't be, you know, saying that one thing because they just love Tupac hypothetically. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2053.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2060.0s)]
*  So much it just slowly changed their whole perspective on on just black folks in general. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2061.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, you'd have like I always had this vision. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2067.0s)]
*  You'd have a dude out in his yard is yelling the N word, but then he closed the door and he's in there fucking moonwalk. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2069.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2074.0s)]
*  You know, that's the MTV generation. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2075.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2076.0s)]
*  Like that is because you think about it like people that grew up in the that's why these these songwriters here in Nashville. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2077.0s)]
*  When they write like every genre is present, you know what I'm saying? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2082.0s)]
*  They're bringing that tool bag of every genre because because the MTV generation and especially now the way streaming is, you know what I'm saying? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2085.0s)]
*  Because back in, you know, when you had to like seek out your music, you know what I'm saying? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2092.0s)]
*  You had to go to the record store and seek out your whatever kind of music, your taste, you know, preferred. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2096.0s)]
*  It was a little different, you know what I'm saying? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2102.0s)]
*  But then when MTV started playing everything, they'd have those blocks. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2104.0s)]
*  I don't know if you remember that they have like the blocks. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2107.0s)]
*  They have hip hop, hip hop block, a rock block, R&B block. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2110.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2115.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2116.0s)]
*  And like so if you're just sitting there watching MTV was during the summertime, you know, that's just what we did as kids. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2117.0s)]
*  You were going to see that NWA video. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2121.0s)]
*  You will see that, you know, Will Smith summertime video. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2124.0s)]
*  And then you were going to see Nirvana. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2128.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2130.0s)]
*  And then you might even see some Tim McGraw and some, you know, whatever. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2131.0s)]
*  So this generation, that generation and moving forward, everybody was just, everything was just that accessible. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2134.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2142.0s)]
*  So everybody has been touched by every genre of music in some kind of way. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2143.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2147.0s)]
*  And now you start to see, and this is interesting too, you see a lot of black country guys on TikTok. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2148.0s)]
*  I see a lot of it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2154.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of, it's getting kind of wild, dude. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2155.0s)]
*  Like I'll meet like everything is just a lot more mixed. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2158.0s)]
*  I've always had this theory that it's going to like in three generations, everybody going to be beige. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2166.0s)]
*  I say that same thing, man. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2167.0s)]
*  We all started the same color. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2169.0s)]
*  I believe, you know, I mean, look, I wasn't there. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2171.0s)]
*  I can't personally. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2173.0s)]
*  Well, what color is a zygote or whatever, like a baby? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2174.0s)]
*  Well, I just think that in that part of the world, that particular part of the world where the world was allegedly based on what we've been told, born, you know, people look a certain way. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2176.0s)]
*  And then I think as we migrated to different areas, you know what I'm saying? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2186.0s)]
*  Like our ancestors migrated to this cold place up here and then had to be in caves for six months out of the year. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2190.0s)]
*  And, and you know what I'm saying? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2196.0s)]
*  So over thousands of years of that reduced exposure to the sun, skin just got paler. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2197.0s)]
*  So we'd split up. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2203.0s)]
*  But then now in the last, what, 100, 200 years, everybody's come back together. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2204.0s)]
*  So, yeah, it's just a matter of time for it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2209.0s)]
*  We go back to that same color, you know, which is like. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2211.0s)]
*  You're going to be able to find anybody to hate, man. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2213.0s)]
*  At that point, you're going to need a chart if you want to be racist, dude. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2215.0s)]
*  That's why I like some places you can't even be racist. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2218.0s)]
*  People still going to hate themselves up here because ultimately that's what it boils down to. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2221.0s)]
*  That's a great point, bro. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2226.0s)]
*  There ain't nobody out there. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2228.0s)]
*  The easiest person for me to hate is my fucking self. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2229.0s)]
*  Honestly, I can't hate anybody else unless I hate myself. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2231.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't love anybody else unless I love myself. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2234.0s)]
*  You know, that's just the way it is. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2238.0s)]
*  So what was so when you're you're so you get so get me to the point where you kind of your music really takes off. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2240.0s)]
*  So basically I moved up to Athens where Big Steve was at and met Bobby Stamps, who was my manager for 20 years. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2246.0s)]
*  And he introduced me to a guy. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2254.0s)]
*  He introduced me to Colt Ford and to a guy named Shannon Houchens, who owns a label. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2256.0s)]
*  Him and Colt have a label here in town called Average Joe's Entertainment in Nashville. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2261.0s)]
*  And but I started just it was a roundabout way. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2266.0s)]
*  But I started just really finding myself in the studio, you know, because I was you know, I'm saying the first time I ever went to a studio, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2271.0s)]
*  I was working as an electrician's apprentice, running condo, bending pipe. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2280.0s)]
*  And and I saved up like three hundred fifty dollars over one summer. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2285.0s)]
*  And the only other guy that I could find that was a rap, you know, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2289.0s)]
*  say that even any inkling of like wanting to be a rapper or Rodney was his name. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2293.0s)]
*  He was he was he was a different kind of guy. You know, but and what you mean autism or something? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2299.0s)]
*  No, he was just he was just a different type of cat. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2303.0s)]
*  I don't I don't really know how to put it. You know, he didn't come from like he didn't everybody played sports. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2307.0s)]
*  You know, saying that was like your biggest badge of honor you could have. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2312.0s)]
*  And he wasn't that kind of guy. He was he was really like a kind of like an Eminem type. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2316.0s)]
*  Like when you hear Eminem talk about like the way he grew up, you know, I'm saying like kind of like that kind of deal, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2321.0s)]
*  you know, like in the trailer, like a little small mobile home, you know, I'm saying. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2326.0s)]
*  And they'd never seen it before like him. Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2330.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that it was even that rare, but it just wasn't most people. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2333.0s)]
*  He was just kind of like the kind of person that was just was he was redheaded. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2340.0s)]
*  Yes, he was. Dude, and he like black culture. Yes. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2344.0s)]
*  Tell me this, bro. Tell me. You just blew my mind with it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2347.0s)]
*  The first dude, the first the guy the guy that was always wearing a North Carolina jersey and hanging out with black people was always a redheaded dude, bro. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2350.0s)]
*  Don't even tell me it wasn't, bro. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2363.0s)]
*  Man, every I don't know how it worked out, bro. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2365.0s)]
*  I don't know how the sun hit him or whatever. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2368.0s)]
*  But I kind of I think our generation, at least where I was growing up, like we kind of were the first generation to like just we all [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2370.0s)]
*  kicked it, you know what I'm saying? Because football was the most important thing and everybody, you know, and like if you play football, like we only call it that matters is Navy. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2376.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2385.0s)]
*  And so, you know, but but but as far as the story of finishing, we saved up, we went to the studio, we get to the studio. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2387.0s)]
*  Up in Atlanta, it's called Eight Ball Recording Studios. I'll never forget. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2394.0s)]
*  So I have my three hundred dollars. He had his three hundred dollars. We got like a 12 hour block. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2398.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. Does that mean producers are in there with you? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2402.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. Listen, so then we get in there and he's like, all right, where's y'all's beats? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2405.0s)]
*  We're like, huh? It hadn't even occurred to us that we were going to need beats. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2409.0s)]
*  And so basically, so we saved up all this money over a period of months. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2414.0s)]
*  Sure. That's a lot of money at that point. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2420.0s)]
*  He's kind of represented to me like he's man. I know what to do. I know what to do. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2422.0s)]
*  But we get there and we got no beats and we don't know how to make no beats. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2425.0s)]
*  But the guy was actually cool enough to sit there and kind of like allow us to like he basically made some garbage beat. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2428.0s)]
*  But, you know, like held our hands there when we felt like we were doing something. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2435.0s)]
*  And we recorded two songs. One was called Nothing But Game, Theo. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2440.0s)]
*  It ain't nothing but game coming out my mouth, player, player. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2444.0s)]
*  There's like the rap was like, right quick, I'm bringing tight shit. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2449.0s)]
*  I'm bringing tight shit. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2452.0s)]
*  Footies jealous marks the jock, bailing through the parking lot when my partner sparked the chop. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2454.0s)]
*  Now I'm feeling kind of strange, like my state of mind done changed off that hurricane and dank. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2458.0s)]
*  I'm starting to think that I'm deranged. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2463.0s)]
*  Tight shit. You know what I mean? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2466.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's how to make you feel good though. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2468.0s)]
*  It was terrible, man. Like it really was. But I was so proud. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2470.0s)]
*  I mean, I had something recorded on a cassette tape. We could ride around and listen to it. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2474.0s)]
*  I can feel it right now. You walk out there, you're like, we fucking got something. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2479.0s)]
*  But the people when I got to Athens. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2483.0s)]
*  Whoop that trick. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2485.0s)]
*  It was just that it wasn't that good. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2486.0s)]
*  It wasn't that good. It was that Oscar. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2488.0s)]
*  But basically like I just felt like, man, this is it. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2491.0s)]
*  Like I felt like I had already made it basically, you know what I'm saying? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2496.0s)]
*  Even though I'm still working three jobs, selling mid grade weed. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2499.0s)]
*  But I'm like, dang man, like this is it. You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2502.0s)]
*  Like girls come around. Yeah, I'm a rapper. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2505.0s)]

*  Oh man, don't let me steal like a laminate from like a tour or something. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2513.0s)]
*  Like So So Def because Fat Shand, the producer that I ended up working with in Athens and all those guys, Bobby and Colt, were close to Jermaine Dupri. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2517.0s)]
*  They worked with Jermaine Dupri and they had like all these stuff, jackets and stuff that said So So Def on it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2525.0s)]
*  So anytime I could, like I would try to get that jacket for a night and go just post up and be like, oh, this whole thing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2530.0s)]

*  Like a dynasty or something? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2556.0s)]
*  I mean, just the forefathers are the pillars of in my view of hip hop in Atlanta as far as representing Atlanta for real, for real, in an accurate way. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2557.0s)]
*  But I used to tell girls that I was the white member of the Dungeon Family like five years before. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2570.0s)]
*  Like the accountant or whatever. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2579.0s)]
*  No, like no, I was the white rapper. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2580.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2582.0s)]
*  Yeah, like in and like there was it was said and I think it probably was said by Rico from Organized Noise. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2583.0s)]
*  He was kind of the the the Dungeon was his mother's basement. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2590.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? His mother's house. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2596.0s)]
*  So he was kind of the patriarch. Is that a good way to put it? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2597.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Airbnb owner. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2600.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2602.0s)]
*  And then so I'd heard that he said white folks shouldn't be participating in hip hop or something like that. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2603.0s)]
*  But I was always like, well, he gonna love me. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2609.0s)]
*  He gonna love me because I'm for real. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2611.0s)]
*  Like I'm real with my shit. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2613.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2614.0s)]
*  I'm representing who I am, you know, and some Georgia shit the right way. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2615.0s)]
*  He gonna love me. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2618.0s)]
*  That's what I would tell my friends. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2619.0s)]
*  But I would tell girls that, yeah, I'm in the Dungeon Family. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2621.0s)]
*  Like way before it could have even been anything remotely resembling reality. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2624.0s)]
*  And I'd be damned if I didn't become a white boy in the Dungeon Family. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2630.0s)]
*  Manifested almost. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2634.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I'm saying? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2635.0s)]
*  So I guess that's what I get from fake it till you make it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2636.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2639.0s)]
*  And, you know, me and Rico, that's my brother. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2640.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2643.0s)]
*  The guy that allegedly has said that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2644.0s)]
*  I mean, he's as close to me as anybody I've met in the music business period. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2646.0s)]
*  So, man, it's just crazy how life can unfold. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2652.0s)]
*  You know, if you... [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2655.0s)]
*  But I had so much faith back then, man. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2656.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2658.0s)]
*  So you had faith in, you mean in God, you mean? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2659.0s)]
*  I mean in God, but in God's plan for me. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2661.0s)]
*  Just didn't... [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2664.0s)]
*  God had a plan for me, you know what I'm saying? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2665.0s)]
*  To do something that was going to impact the world and that, you know, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2667.0s)]
*  that I just always felt like I had a spirit, man, that, you know, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2671.0s)]
*  I want to be an extension of whatever that ultimate love, you know, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2675.0s)]
*  love-based energy or spirit that God is. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2681.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2684.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2685.0s)]
*  I always just felt like an extension of that because, you know, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2686.0s)]
*  I like to be a purveyor of love and light, so to speak, you know, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2690.0s)]
*  and I just felt like there was some plan where I was going to, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2696.0s)]
*  like, just have an impact on the world in some kind of way, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2699.0s)]
*  you know, based on that. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2702.0s)]
*  And, you know, in some ways it's worked out exactly how I could have drawn it up [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2704.0s)]
*  and in some ways not, you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2709.0s)]
*  But it's been a hell of a journey, you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2712.0s)]
*  And I still do not, for one second, question God's, you know, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2714.0s)]
*  like, involvement in the whole thing. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2719.0s)]
*  That's just me, you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2721.0s)]
*  People are welcome to believe anything they want, you know, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2723.0s)]
*  in all of our experiences and our upbringing, you know, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2726.0s)]
*  and in our experiences as adults, everything shapes us, you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2730.0s)]
*  Our DNA, you know, is a part of that too, but I just believe what I believe [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2734.0s)]
*  and it's something that I feel and it can't be quantified in words or, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2740.0s)]
*  you know, it's just beyond us. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2745.0s)]
*  But I know when I'm being creative, Theo, like when I'm writing, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2747.0s)]
*  when I really get in that zone, there's nothing I can ever do to feel closer to God [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2751.0s)]
*  or, you know, to just that energy source, that love, you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2757.0s)]
*  Like, I just feel it. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2762.0s)]
*  It's like I'm in such harmony in the way time can just disappear. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2763.0s)]
*  It's like I'm doing what I was put here to do, you know what I'm saying? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2767.0s)]
*  And whatever, whoever created me is pleased at this time, you know what I'm saying? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2771.0s)]
*  And then it's like I feel some, like, internal turmoil at times too. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2778.0s)]
*  And it's like I'm not doing what I was put here to do and that spirit's not pleased. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2784.0s)]
*  I can feel that too. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2791.0s)]
*  Not abandoned though, you know, just... [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2793.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2795.0s)]
*  Do you... [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2796.0s)]
*  Where were we at with it? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2797.0s)]
*  Man, I got a terrible, terrible, like, this is like the third podcast I've done, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2798.0s)]
*  and landing things, you know what I'm saying? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2804.0s)]
*  It's like I love talking about every aspect of my story, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2807.0s)]
*  but I'm definitely trying to work on landing shit. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2811.0s)]
*  I think you've done a nice job. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2814.0s)]
*  There's a couple of times you were like, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2815.0s)]
*  well, let's finish this point before we go on to something else. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2816.0s)]
*  Because I sometimes kind of forget what's... [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2818.0s)]
*  I don't forget what's going on, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2821.0s)]
*  but it's hard for me to like remember and be thinking at the same time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2822.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2826.0s)]
*  Well put. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2827.0s)]
*  So... [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2828.0s)]
*  But to go back to the... [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2829.0s)]
*  So at the studio, you know what I'm saying? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2830.0s)]
*  So we get that song done. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2832.0s)]
*  Right, you want my fucking boyer in there. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2834.0s)]

*  He just had that rattle in him. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2908.2s)]
*  He was out there rambling, wasn't he? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2909.2s)]
*  He had that fucking rattle in him, bruh. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2910.2s)]
*  You could tell he never slept. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  Damn. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2913.04s)]

*  No drugs. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2915.04s)]
*  No drugs, bruh. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2916.04s)]
*  He had drugs built into his fucking... [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2917.04s)]
*  I think we know that now. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2918.2799999999997s)]
*  His mental illness. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2919.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2920.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2921.64s)]
*  But back then, it was just damn alright. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2922.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2923.64s)]
*  This boy just, you know, he's lit. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2924.64s)]
*  But... [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2925.64s)]
*  He was early, he was just... [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2926.64s)]
*  He looked like he fucking was early and late at the same time, bruh. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2927.64s)]
*  Damn. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2930.8399999999997s)]
*  He was just... [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2931.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, his eyes never shut. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2932.8399999999997s)]
*  He look like he didn't sleep, man. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2933.8399999999997s)]
*  Who knows what he went through, man? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2935.0s)]
*  Who knows what his whole life was like [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2936.64s)]
*  that made him where he stayed that word? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2938.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2941.28s)]
*  This is something I think about now, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2943.2s)]
*  and I'm sure you got some insight [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2945.04s)]
*  and a perspective on this too. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2946.6s)]
*  What if we went back through history, Theo, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2948.84s)]
*  and looked at every violent crime, every murder, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2951.24s)]
*  even rape, has ever been committed [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2954.6s)]
*  in the history of planet Earth going back? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2956.68s)]
*  I wonder what percentage of those violent crimes [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2960.86s)]
*  were committed by people that had they had [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2963.44s)]
*  a thorough psychiatric evaluation, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2966.88s)]
*  or it was a mental illness. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2970.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2971.88s)]
*  It was something that at the time, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2972.7200000000003s)]
*  obviously there was nothing, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2976.44s)]
*  when did mental health even become a thing, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2979.84s)]
*  like last 50 years? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2983.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2984.64s)]
*  And it's even been like a slow and jagged [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2985.52s)]
*  ascent to where we are now. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2990.88s)]
*  I thought about that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2994.3s)]
*  If we, there's just something to be said for that though [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2995.54s)]
*  that hurt people hurt people. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=2998.9s)]
*  100%, man. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3001.1s)]
*  Well, they just had a guy on Joe Rogan, this guy, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3002.38s)]
*  Gaber Mate, Gaber Mate. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3004.78s)]
*  And he is like, I wanna say he's a psychiatrist, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3007.46s)]
*  but he's like a really good thinker. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3012.28s)]
*  Some people are real good at thinking. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3013.98s)]
*  And he talks a lot about trauma, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3016.2000000000003s)]
*  and trauma is kind of a buzzword that people use a lot now. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3018.2200000000003s)]
*  But one thing that he was saying. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3021.46s)]
*  Like resonates. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3023.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3024.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3025.7s)]
*  That really resonates. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3026.54s)]
*  Yeah, that really resonates, bro. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3027.38s)]
*  Yeah, that fucking resonates, bro. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3029.98s)]
*  Raisinets, bro. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3031.9s)]
*  So close. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3033.2200000000003s)]
*  Raisinets. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3034.2200000000003s)]
*  But he was saying how like pain and stuff [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3037.3s)]
*  can be transferred through DNA. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3041.62s)]
*  And maybe some of that's believable or not, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3044.9s)]
*  but it can definitely be transferred [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3047.5s)]
*  through the way that you treat people [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3048.9s)]
*  and the new things that I like the way that you. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3050.7s)]
*  It's so crazy how many times something happens [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3053.5s)]
*  to somebody when they're a child, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3055.22s)]
*  and then they do the exact same thing. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3056.58s)]
*  They do the exact same thing. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3060.22s)]
*  And it's interesting, man. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3062.54s)]
*  It is, and it's just a lot of like, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3063.58s)]
*  we're just now getting to the point too [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3066.3399999999997s)]
*  where we have so much reflection of ourselves because of. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3067.9399999999996s)]
*  That's a good and bad thing. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3072.06s)]
*  Right, it's a good and bad thing. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3073.3399999999997s)]
*  But it's like we have such a recording [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3075.14s)]
*  of how people operate and behave now [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3076.7799999999997s)]
*  that you're able to see a lot of like, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3078.6s)]
*  you know, you're okay and compare it, you know? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3080.82s)]
*  And just document it. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3083.42s)]
*  So I think it's like, we're getting to a point [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3084.7400000000002s)]
*  where it's like we're really documenting [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3086.7000000000003s)]
*  how much pain has been like just in the, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3088.5800000000004s)]
*  in the damn gene pool of humanity. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3091.9s)]
*  And it makes you wonder kind of what the future will be like. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3095.5400000000004s)]
*  Will we be able to solve that kind of thing? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3098.98s)]
*  Or we will just be able to continue to just. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3102.1400000000003s)]
*  Because I don't think, we are more aware of like, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3104.46s)]
*  of just, you know, mental illnesses. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3107.62s)]
*  But I don't necessarily think that we've really figured out [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3110.74s)]
*  the best ways to treat them. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3113.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3115.14s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3115.98s)]
*  To give somebody, you know, because it's like, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3116.8199999999997s)]
*  you know, I've been on meds before, you know, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3120.38s)]
*  at different times. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3123.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's like, okay, I don't feel that way anymore. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3124.14s)]
*  But now I feel this way, which is equally terrible. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3128.24s)]
*  Or it affects, you know, some other aspect of my being [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3130.7s)]
*  that just makes it either worse for me ultimately [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3133.7s)]
*  or at best like just a trade off, you know what I'm saying? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3138.46s)]
*  So, you know, I just, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3140.54s)]
*  treating everything with chemical, with manmade medicine. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3144.1s)]
*  Right, it might not be the way. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3147.66s)]
*  Yeah, it might not be. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3148.7799999999997s)]
*  We might look in 30 years, we might look back and be like, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3150.1s)]
*  okay, we took a real bad turn as a society with trying that. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3152.94s)]
*  Like back in the late 1800s when they were like drilling, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3156.1s)]
*  you know, screws in people's, you know, at your temples. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3158.7s)]
*  And they would like just kill that frontal lobe. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3162.7s)]
*  That's how they would make people like chill out. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3164.9s)]
*  That was 125 years ago. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3168.3s)]
*  And then you had to pay for that dude to come over. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3170.14s)]
*  Yeah, and your family's there like, how did that work? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3171.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3174.34s)]

*  Man. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3179.82s)]

*  Man, this is insane, dude. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3185.42s)]
*  Your cousin come and hang his hat on that little [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3186.94s)]
*  little fucking spike. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3189.2200000000003s)]
*  Literally, you're just like. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3190.06s)]
*  For like 60 years, like, it's crazy, man. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3192.66s)]
*  Like who came up with that? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3196.9s)]
*  Like they should have done. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3198.46s)]
*  I hope that that was what that person at some point [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3200.06s)]
*  in their life, I hope whoever thought of that first [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3202.42s)]
*  and started doing that, I hope they had to experience it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3204.94s)]
*  Man, that's crazy. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3208.2999999999997s)]
*  And they were also saying on that episode [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3210.66s)]
*  just about how people take care of their children [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3212.02s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3214.3399999999997s)]
*  Like just that there's not enough connection [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3215.18s)]
*  between families and stuff these days. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3219.1s)]
*  People used to be in tribes. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3221.06s)]
*  A lot of that has been talked about in the past 10 years [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3222.42s)]
*  about how people used to be in tribes and were closer. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3224.82s)]
*  So not only did your mother see you, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3227.6600000000003s)]
*  but your aunt saw you, your grandmother was right there. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3229.26s)]
*  There was constant like attention and evaluation [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3231.86s)]
*  of what was going on with you [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3235.7400000000002s)]
*  and that they think people developed the healthier then. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3236.94s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, but it's just like, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3241.0600000000004s)]
*  it was a theory that that man was talking about. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3243.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, I just, I think that this, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3245.7000000000003s)]
*  the gap between human beings period [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3247.94s)]
*  is just getting wider and wider. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3250.34s)]
*  That is weird. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3251.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3252.6000000000004s)]
*  We were talking about it last night, like social media. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3253.64s)]
*  You know, it's designed to bring us all closer together, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3256.16s)]
*  but ultimately it creates such polarized, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3258.64s)]
*  you know, like views of things. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3261.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3263.52s)]
*  Like social media is probably as much to blame as anything [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3264.36s)]
*  for the way our country has, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3271.28s)]
*  it's always been these two drastically different choices [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3274.12s)]
*  that we had when it came to political stuff. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3278.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3280.0s)]
*  And I just want to say for the record, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3280.84s)]
*  I don't want to fuck both of them, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3282.32s)]
*  but it's like, because that's just not, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3283.76s)]
*  that just doesn't make good sense to me. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3287.48s)]
*  Like our two choices are these two radically different, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3289.1600000000003s)]
*  like viewpoints and it's just crazy, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3292.76s)]
*  but like social media has driven that wedge [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3295.96s)]
*  and just made it that much wider, that gap. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3299.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3301.26s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely led to a lot more. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3302.1000000000004s)]
*  Because people don't seek information, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3303.92s)]
*  they seek affirmation, you know what I'm saying? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3304.76s)]
*  So they follow things that they know are going to continue [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3306.44s)]
*  to feed them the same thing they've been on, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3309.28s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3312.0800000000004s)]
*  And sometimes I think each side is right, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3312.92s)]
*  you know, at different times. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3315.0800000000004s)]
*  I think the sensible compromise of the middle is kind of, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3316.0s)]
*  it just makes a little too much sense to me. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3319.6000000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3321.4s)]
*  Like sometimes, you know, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3322.2400000000002s)]
*  this way of thinking is going to be the best way [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3323.76s)]
*  to go about it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3325.5600000000004s)]
*  And then sometimes this way of thinking [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3326.4s)]
*  is going to be the best way to go about it. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3327.48s)]
*  But you know, you'll have like these 280 character or less, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3329.92s)]
*  like, you know, just, what do you call it? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3333.0s)]
*  Hot takes basically, like of just saying something [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3337.36s)]
*  or reporting a certain event in a certain way [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3340.44s)]
*  that's going to reaffirm to that group of people [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3343.44s)]
*  that yep, see? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3346.08s)]
*  I was right. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3347.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3348.04s)]
*  This is it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3348.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3349.7000000000003s)]
*  And so, and then they, it's like the whole, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3350.54s)]
*  the old adage, a lichen will travel around the world [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3353.6800000000003s)]
*  before the truth has a chance to put his pants on [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3357.6400000000003s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3359.6800000000003s)]
*  I butchered it, but yeah, something like that. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3360.52s)]
*  But I understand it, yeah. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3362.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, people share stuff, you know what I'm saying? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3363.2400000000002s)]
*  The next thing you know, it's just, it spreads. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3365.04s)]
*  We used to play that game, the telephone game. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3367.48s)]
*  And when you was kids, we'd play the telephone game. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, you like sit there and whisper the person. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3371.36s)]
*  This person. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3373.7599999999998s)]
*  Anybody, the time it got to the end, it was so good. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3374.6s)]
*  Somebody lied. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3376.16s)]
*  Oh, we had one kid, bro. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3377.0s)]
*  This is kind of fucked up, but he would just yell the, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3378.4s)]
*  when it came back to him, he would just say [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3381.16s)]
*  was the N word every time, bro. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3382.8s)]
*  What? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3384.8s)]
*  This motherfucker, yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3385.64s)]
*  He was just, I don't even think he was, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3387.0s)]
*  I think he was just mentally unwell, you know? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3388.72s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3390.6s)]
*  Cause he would be like, you know. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3391.44s)]
*  He thought that shit was funny. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3392.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh no, something's wrong with him. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3393.68s)]
*  But he, it would be like hurricane [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3395.3199999999997s)]
*  and it would break around and every time [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3397.72s)]
*  and the teacher would fucking. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3399.44s)]
*  But he just knew that word, man. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3400.48s)]
*  He knew it like got a reaction probably. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3402.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he might've had. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3403.92s)]
*  He didn't understand it, but like. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3405.04s)]
*  He might, he also talked about like Egypt [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3406.4s)]
*  and the pharaohs a lot. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3408.56s)]
*  He might've had mental disability. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3409.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3412.52s)]
*  But, so take me through, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  so the music is popping, things get going. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3415.04s)]
*  I apologize, I like to talk about a variety of shit. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3417.68s)]
*  No, this is great, bro. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3420.7999999999997s)]
*  This is what it is. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the conversation. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3422.6s)]
*  But I do, I don't wanna de-emphasize, you know, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3423.44s)]
*  the fact that I've had an incredible journey, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3425.36s)]
*  you know, through music. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3427.72s)]
*  But, so yeah, so then I'm in Athens at that point. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3428.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm starting to make some connections [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3432.08s)]
*  and we ended up putting out my first album, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3433.64s)]
*  my first major release on Beat Club, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3436.56s)]
*  Timberlands record label, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3438.3199999999997s)]
*  the first single, Ugly was on this album. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3439.88s)]
*  We put out an independent version of that album [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3443.8399999999997s)]
*  by the same name about two years before [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3448.04s)]
*  the major label version came out. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3451.0s)]
*  So that's what people started hearing underground. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3452.6s)]
*  It started spreading around Georgia [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3454.72s)]
*  and it was like, people always talk about marketing plans, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3456.12s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3458.76s)]
*  And like, we gotta come up with the perfect, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3459.6s)]
*  you know, when something's the shit shit, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3462.08s)]
*  it's just word of mouth is the marketing plan. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3464.4s)]
*  And it was that kind of deal, you know. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3466.68s)]
*  And I'm just blessed to have been a part of it [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3468.44s)]
*  and to, you know, to have had that clarity [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3470.32s)]
*  at that particular point in time [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3473.16s)]
*  to be able to do something that people fuck with [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3474.28s)]
*  to that degree. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3476.64s)]
*  But literally, like one person, two people, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3477.6s)]
*  four people, four people, eight people, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3481.04s)]
*  and so on and so on and so on. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3482.48s)]
*  And yeah, so pretty soon, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3484.0s)]
*  and there was a lot of other like, you know, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3486.04s)]
*  interesting details, tidbits of information to the story, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3491.04s)]
*  but short story long. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3493.7599999999998s)]
*  Basically, we signed with Interscope Records, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3496.16s)]
*  you know, Jimmy Iovine, the same after, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3498.84s)]
*  in 1999 when I first saw Hi, my name is, I was destroyed. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3501.6s)]
*  Why, cause you thought he beat you to the point? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3507.8s)]
*  I thought at that time as a white rapper, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3509.6400000000003s)]
*  you pretty much felt like, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3511.5600000000004s)]
*  they ain't gonna be with one more. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3512.92s)]
*  Like if they ever, if one ever gets back in the door, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3514.84s)]
*  it's just gonna be one. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3518.6400000000003s)]
*  And then it was like, I saw that and I was like, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3520.1200000000003s)]
*  whoa, he did it perfect. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3522.1600000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3526.32s)]
*  And I remember my best friend Big Steve, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3527.6000000000004s)]
*  and I was just all depressed and he came and he was like, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3529.36s)]
*  man, I think you got it fucked up, man. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3532.7200000000003s)]
*  He's like, yeah, he, that's some awesome shit. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3534.6800000000003s)]
*  He said, but you southern, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3536.8s)]
*  you is different, you know what I'm saying? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3538.32s)]
*  Like you, you still straight, you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3540.76s)]
*  You still got your lane. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3543.0800000000004s)]
*  I was like, keep it coming, keep it coming. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3545.0800000000004s)]
*  All right, you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3547.36s)]
*  And then I got back up, you know, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3548.2400000000002s)]
*  eventually and got back to work. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3549.88s)]
*  And two years later I was signed [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3551.92s)]
*  to the same label as him. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3554.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3555.56s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet him? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3556.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I did. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3558.04s)]
*  I met him at the anger management tour in 2003, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3560.1200000000003s)]
*  it was a crazy experience. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3563.6800000000003s)]
*  I thought you were gonna say anger management meetings. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3565.04s)]
*  That's what I thought you were gonna say too. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3566.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3567.4s)]
*  You know, he was, I don't know, he was a little, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3568.2400000000002s)]
*  he was on the private plane level, you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3574.1600000000003s)]
*  When I was still flying commercial, you know, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3576.84s)]
*  or I'm still flying commercial, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3579.6800000000003s)]
*  but I was definitely getting on up there [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3580.92s)]
*  in first class and all that. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3582.88s)]
*  But you know, he jumped very quickly to private plane level, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3584.28s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3587.56s)]
*  Where he was just moving at his own pace. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3588.4s)]
*  But we met, man, and he was very complimentary. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3590.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3595.2400000000002s)]
*  Probably the only time I've ever been starstruck in my life [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3596.44s)]
*  when I met Eminem, it was just like, wow, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3598.72s)]
*  that's the real Eminem right there, you know what I'm saying? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3601.72s)]
*  But man, he was extremely complimentary, you know what I mean? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3605.88s)]
*  And he always has been. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3609.08s)]
*  Even when there was a diss song [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3611.36s)]
*  where he dissed me and Paul, Paul Wall, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3613.64s)]
*  that leaked, and even in the diss, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3616.12s)]
*  I feel like he was complimentary of me, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3621.36s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3623.0s)]
*  And he was actually, I don't know where the information [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3624.6000000000004s)]
*  that he, but it was the wrong drug he said I was on [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3627.28s)]
*  or whatever, you know what I'm saying? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3631.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I hate that when people get your drugs. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3632.4s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's like, come on, man. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3633.96s)]
*  Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3636.2400000000002s)]
*  But it is what it is. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3638.96s)]
*  Paul Rosenberg, his manager, was always super cool to me. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3641.7200000000003s)]
*  And the whole Shady Records staff, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3646.56s)]
*  I never have had a chance to get close to Eminem like that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3648.28s)]
*  as far as building a super close personal relationship. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3652.0s)]
*  But man, he would ask people about me, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3655.52s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3659.08s)]
*  Anytime he would see somebody that he knew fucked with me, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3659.92s)]
*  he would be like, how's Bubba doing? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3664.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3666.44s)]
*  Like a couple times. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3667.28s)]
*  So I got a number of respect for him, man. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3668.96s)]
*  Love and respect. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3671.56s)]
*  And so, but to go on back, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3674.04s)]
*  so I was signed to Interscope Records for about nine months. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3675.84s)]
*  And after having so much success, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3679.96s)]
*  Jimmy Iovine, shout out to Jimmy Iovine, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3682.04s)]
*  just an absolute iconic figure in music [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3684.7200000000003s)]
*  and entertainment period. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3688.28s)]
*  And that man believed in me a great deal. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3690.52s)]
*  I still don't even necessarily understand [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3694.12s)]
*  what it was about me that made him believe in me so much. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3697.0s)]
*  But he did, you know what I'm saying? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3701.44s)]
*  And he's a genius type of human being. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3703.04s)]
*  So that always gave me confidence [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3706.84s)]
*  just to know that like, man, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3709.28s)]
*  the baddest motherfucker in this whole business. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3711.48s)]
*  Saw something in me. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3713.84s)]
*  Yeah, like he believes in me to the point [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3714.6800000000003s)]
*  where he's gonna push the max, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3716.52s)]
*  the biggest button that Interscope Records, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3718.32s)]
*  the number one label in music, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3720.28s)]
*  could push, you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3722.8s)]
*  Six million dollars spent on me in marketing. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3723.88s)]
*  People know the name, Bubba Sparks, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3725.84s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3727.4s)]
*  And so, but he, after the Eminem and Dre success, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3728.6800000000003s)]
*  he kind of was like, I might be onto something [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3732.84s)]
*  with this whole, get the black producer, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3734.5600000000004s)]
*  white boy, give him credibility, you know, off top. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3737.2s)]
*  And so he tried a couple of other routes, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3740.04s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3743.0s)]
*  As far as hooking me up with people [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3743.8399999999997s)]
*  and the chemistry just wasn't there. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3745.12s)]
*  And then finally he asked me one night, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3748.0s)]
*  he called me and he was like, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm about to meet with Timberland. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3752.48s)]
*  He's like, what do you think about that? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3753.96s)]
*  I was like, oh, that'd be perfect, dude. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3755.2s)]
*  I was like, that's it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3756.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3758.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3758.8399999999997s)]
*  Next morning, I was on a flight out to LA [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3759.66s)]
*  and the rest was history. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3762.2s)]
*  And I was the first artist released [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3763.7599999999998s)]
*  at Timberland as far as it being his record label [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3766.08s)]
*  and him releasing the artist. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3770.24s)]
*  I was the first one. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3771.4s)]
*  Yeah, you was the first one. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3772.24s)]
*  I was the first artist he ever released. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3773.08s)]
*  The first one. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3774.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3775.44s)]
*  Overall, right? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3776.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3777.1s)]
*  And so what was your personal life like at that point? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3777.94s)]
*  Cause life gets crazy, bro, when you start getting where. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3780.44s)]
*  I was a young country motherfucker with millions of dollars [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3783.0s)]
*  and pretty much whatever you could have in a budding, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3788.3199999999997s)]
*  a spawning drug addict, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=3793.8s)]

*  so when do you start to know that you had an issue? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4112.76s)]
*  I was on tour with Blink 182. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4115.8s)]
*  Shout out to boy Trav, Trav Parker. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4119.28s)]
*  And I had been prescribed Percocets for about six months, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4122.08s)]
*  and then they just cut them cold turkey. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4128.2s)]
*  I knew nothing about addiction or physical dependence [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4130.28s)]
*  or withdrawals, dope scene. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4135.64s)]
*  I knew nothing about shit. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4137.56s)]
*  Shit about shit, I knew shit about shit. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4140.72s)]
*  And I had run out, and I just think I'm just done with that. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4143.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4147.360000000001s)]
*  And I remember I had this process, you know what I'm saying? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4148.2s)]
*  The bus would get into wherever we were going [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4154.0s)]
*  like that morning, and I would go in the hotel, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4155.84s)]
*  and I would sleep till like three o'clock. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4158.56s)]
*  I would get up slowly, you know what I'm saying? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4160.6s)]
*  I'd take a shower and stuff. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4163.16s)]
*  And then before I would leave the hotel at like five o'clock, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4164.64s)]
*  I would take, I think I would take two pills [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4168.36s)]
*  and then four shots of Patron. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4173.679999999999s)]
*  And that would get me in the go be me in public [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4176.88s)]
*  and start angling towards showtime. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4180.48s)]
*  And I remember I obviously didn't have the pills, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4184.28s)]
*  and I laid down trying to go to sleep like normal. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4186.599999999999s)]
*  30 minutes later, I wake up sweating, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4190.16s)]
*  just feeling inside out. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4191.88s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit, I'm sick, this is crazy. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4194.12s)]
*  I think I'm just sick like cold or flu or something. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4196.6s)]
*  And I'm like, oh man. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4200.280000000001s)]
*  And I try to lay back down. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4202.64s)]
*  Maybe take some cold medicine, lay back down, can't sleep. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4204.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, man, what is wrong with me? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4207.400000000001s)]
*  It's a unique feeling. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4209.200000000001s)]
*  This is like a, never felt this exact type of thing before. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4210.8s)]
*  And then it hit me. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4215.4800000000005s)]
*  Damn, it's because I ain't got no pills. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4217.64s)]
*  It's like, damn, am I addicted to these things? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4220.320000000001s)]
*  Like what? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4222.280000000001s)]
*  And I remember I talked to somebody, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4223.96s)]
*  probably my manager or somebody, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4225.88s)]
*  and was like, you think I'm addicted to them? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4227.160000000001s)]
*  He's like, I don't know, maybe so. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4230.080000000001s)]
*  Were you taking more of them than you were supposed to? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4233.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4235.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4237.200000000001s)]
*  But I was just like, I don't know. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4240.320000000001s)]
*  It was just a foreign concept to me. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4243.72s)]
*  That was definitely one of those things. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4246.8s)]
*  I had known some addicts, some drunks, a lot of drunks. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4248.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4254.2s)]
*  But that's all they used to call them. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4255.04s)]
*  Really? Yeah, right. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4256.04s)]
*  And, but for me, I just never, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4257.24s)]
*  nobody ever thinks it's gonna, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4260.400000000001s)]
*  it could happen to them until it does. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4261.72s)]
*  But I just remember being like, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4263.08s)]
*  damn, I'm addicted to these monoburgers. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4264.64s)]
*  But I was moving so fast. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4266.52s)]
*  I said, you know what, when I get to a stopping point, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4268.52s)]
*  you know, a resting like area, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4271.4400000000005s)]
*  I'll take care of it and get on off of them. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4274.72s)]
*  But for now I just need to buy them on the street. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4276.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4280.04s)]
*  So I started buying them on the street, real heavy. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4280.88s)]
*  Tray, chunky Tray, shout out to chunky Tray. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4283.5599999999995s)]

*  Gang gang. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4287.2s)]
*  Big Steve's 15 years sober. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4288.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4290.12s)]
*  You know, I'm the only dipshit [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4290.96s)]
*  that just hadn't been able to, you know, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4292.48s)]
*  find that willingness or whatever like to, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4294.639999999999s)]
*  you know, I'm a thinker, you know what I'm saying? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4297.4s)]
*  That can be a big fucking hindrance to recovery. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4299.32s)]
*  When you're creative, you create a lot of ways [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4303.8s)]
*  you can figure shit out yourself. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4305.76s)]
*  Buddy. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4307.32s)]

*  I just got like, I think I'm like 150 days maybe. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4309.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember talking to you. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4312.48s)]
*  We were both like at the same time. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4314.48s)]
*  We're on the same journey. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4316.839999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I have, you know, these days forever. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4318.28s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4320.44s)]
*  But just to- [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4322.32s)]
*  So you started having to get them like behind the scenes? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4323.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I was buying them on the street [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4326.12s)]
*  and a short story long, that was like in 2004, I think. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4327.839999999999s)]
*  And then I ended up finally going to rehab, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4333.639999999999s)]
*  like pretty much at the peak of Miss New Booty. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4337.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4340.16s)]
*  I did not enjoy that. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4341.68s)]
*  You know, you were asking that I enjoy the, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4343.0s)]
*  when I first came into the game, Ugly. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4345.24s)]
*  Ugly was my first number, first ever release [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4348.6s)]
*  as far as a single and my first number one record. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4351.28s)]
*  And that was a great time. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4354.44s)]
*  But the Miss New Booty time, man, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4357.08s)]
*  it was just trying to be in places, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4360.88s)]
*  traveling around, running out of pills, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4364.04s)]
*  just having to white-knuckle it, be tough, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4366.8s)]
*  and get through just big shit, you know what I mean? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4370.92s)]
*  And things that I should have been enjoying. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4374.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4378.28s)]
*  It was a huge record and just so many blessings came from it. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4379.12s)]
*  But my perception at that time was really fucked. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4383.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4388.56s)]
*  But I remember I had like half a million dollars [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4389.4s)]
*  worth of shows over like a two month period [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4392.48s)]
*  and I told my manager, Bobby, I was like, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4397.5199999999995s)]
*  man, I gotta go, you know what I'm saying? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4400.44s)]
*  I said, I can't do it anymore, man. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4402.4s)]
*  I said, I'm about to get on, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4404.839999999999s)]
*  about to check out of here or something. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4406.12s)]
*  I don't know what's, and... [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4407.4s)]
*  Like how was it, did it get pretty like, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4410.04s)]

*  Have you always been that way? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4448.56s)]
*  But especially just to know that somebody, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4449.4s)]
*  they're on the phone laughing to their homeboys [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4450.4800000000005s)]

*  and then they gonna ride up, whatever. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4464.88s)]
*  And I'm sitting there for six hours on a Saturday [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4466.88s)]
*  and probably missing some shit that I'm supposed to be, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4469.32s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4471.2s)]
*  And just, I just couldn't, I couldn't do it anymore. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4472.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4477.04s)]
*  And then just tired of being dope sick, man. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4477.88s)]
*  Like, you know, that was the deal at that time. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4479.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4483.88s)]
*  Was the opiates, you know what I'm saying? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4484.72s)]
*  And you know, I don't go down the same street, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4486.12s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4490.8s)]
*  Like multiple times very often, you know what I'm saying? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4491.64s)]
*  As far as that goes. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4494.8s)]
*  But I would have never, at that time, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4495.68s)]
*  I could have never seen there being a day, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4498.6s)]
*  six hour period where I didn't use [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4501.92s)]
*  like some type of opiate at that time. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4504.32s)]
*  And I thought I would never be able to get beyond that. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4506.84s)]
*  You know, and I did. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4510.0s)]
*  You know, and I could, suboxone's a part of my journey. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4511.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4514.240000000001s)]
*  I can say that's the only way I was able to stop [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4515.08s)]
*  and stay stopped as far as, and people say like, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4518.320000000001s)]
*  you just traded one addiction for another. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4521.92s)]
*  Yes and no. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4524.08s)]
*  Because the difference is if I'm out here taking [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4525.04s)]
*  Roxy's and Oxycontin and whatever else, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4528.360000000001s)]
*  especially this fentanyl world, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4530.8s)]
*  this going down out here now, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4532.400000000001s)]
*  that's a whole different level. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4537.6s)]
*  But when you take suboxone, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4539.0s)]
*  you can take four milligrams a day. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4543.76s)]
*  This is just my experience now. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4545.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4547.4s)]
*  I'm not the judge, jury, and executioner on anything. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4548.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4550.28s)]
*  My opinion in 250, I'll get you Coca-Cola. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4551.12s)]
*  But- [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4553.6s)]
*  Man, you sound like Riff Raff, bro. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4554.44s)]
*  Y'all got something with the same thing, man. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4556.64s)]
*  It's real interesting. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4558.36s)]
*  Man, you know, I ain't never met Riff Raff, man. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4559.2s)]
*  But I know, it's just certain people [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4560.76s)]
*  you just know you would fuck with them. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4563.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4564.88s)]
*  He's a special guy, man. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4565.72s)]
*  He's cool. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4566.56s)]
*  He's real creative too. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4567.4s)]
*  I seen that shit he did with the tennis racket that time, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4569.6s)]
*  man, some of the most unbelievable shit I ever seen, man. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4571.6s)]
*  He's a deep dude. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4573.84s)]
*  And we got several mutual, you know. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4574.68s)]
*  But anyway, so, but you know, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4576.84s)]
*  your tolerance doesn't go up on the suboxone. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4579.56s)]
*  You can take the same amount, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4581.84s)]
*  and it's never gonna, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4583.2s)]
*  your tolerance is never gonna force you to take more, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4584.6s)]
*  whereas when you're taking the other stuff, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4588.96s)]
*  like your tolerance is just going to slowly build and build. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4591.16s)]
*  I've always wanted to do methadone. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4594.52s)]
*  I've never done it. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4596.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've taken some methadone, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4597.02s)]
*  but not as like a solution, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4599.42s)]
*  but just as a, that's all you got. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4601.1s)]
*  All that. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4602.9400000000005s)]
*  But, but yeah, so, and. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4604.780000000001s)]
*  Did you think, a lot of times, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4608.02s)]
*  like I've been in and out of the program [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4610.38s)]
*  for maybe six years, right? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4612.38s)]
*  Six years. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4614.5s)]
*  I've been in and out since 2007. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4615.34s)]
*  What's that, 15? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4618.46s)]
*  And I never thought I had this problem. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4619.540000000001s)]
*  I thought everything was pretty normal in my life, you know, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4621.3s)]
*  and it came on really later in my, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4623.740000000001s)]
*  I thought for me. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4625.74s)]
*  But when people came in with opiate addiction, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4627.14s)]
*  I always thought, to me it seemed like [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4631.34s)]
*  you had people that were real alcoholics that were in there, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4634.5s)]
*  but then some people just got so, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4637.78s)]
*  like somebody goes in because they hurt their back. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4640.1s)]
*  That's not a person that's, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4642.02s)]
*  and then they get, I mean, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4644.22s)]
*  people were getting so addicted to opiates. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4645.74s)]
*  What your mind doesn't know the difference is the thing. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4647.58s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4650.18s)]
*  Like it's just like, I know people, my old sponsor, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4651.02s)]
*  shout out to Stephen K. and Alan LaGrange, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4654.46s)]
*  but he was like, I ain't taking nothing. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4656.22s)]
*  He said, I don't care what happens to me, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4659.58s)]
*  I ain't taking no pain medication. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4660.9s)]
*  He said, my brain is not gonna know the difference. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4662.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4664.54s)]
*  That shit gets in my system, it's gonna do what it does, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4665.38s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4667.7s)]
*  Regardless of the reason, being righteous or, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4668.52s)]
*  you know, it being prescribed by a doctor [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4670.82s)]

*  He was like. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4675.18s)]
*  It feel like they made a cheat code [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4676.0s)]
*  when they made opiates though, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4677.02s)]
*  when they made like some of these opiates. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4678.7s)]
*  It feels like these companies, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4680.54s)]
*  they made so many more people addicts that were. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4685.18s)]
*  Oh man, you can't tell me it was. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4688.9400000000005s)]
*  And I could break it down even on a more freakier level, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4691.06s)]
*  man, it's just like, it's very interesting to me [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4694.38s)]
*  that up to say 2008, there were pain pills everywhere. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4697.34s)]
*  And you could, there's about three or four cities [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4703.5s)]
*  in America you could get heroin in. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4705.7s)]
*  Port cities type stuff. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4707.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, you know, New York, LA, maybe Baltimore, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4709.78s)]
*  New Orleans, you know what I'm saying? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4714.219999999999s)]
*  Like, you just couldn't get heroin in a lot of places. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4715.259999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4718.0199999999995s)]
*  And I would know, you know, especially like anything [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4720.7s)]
*  that was actually anywhere close to resembling [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4723.5s)]
*  actual real heroin. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4726.5s)]
*  And then, I don't know, we'd go fight a war, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4728.139999999999s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, in the Golden Triangle, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4732.58s)]
*  where the poppy fields, the most poppy fields are [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4735.7s)]
*  in the whole world. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4738.38s)]
*  And I'm not saying that's the only reason [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4741.34s)]
*  that that war took place, or there's a primary reason. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4743.02s)]
*  But here, fast forward to now, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4745.5s)]
*  hell, it's damn difficult to get a pain pill. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4748.78s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4751.18s)]
*  Like, a lot of, you know, parents of, you know, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4752.02s)]
*  kids that had overdosed and died [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4758.5s)]
*  started going to Congress, you know, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4760.58s)]
*  started basically letting their presence be felt [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4762.86s)]
*  and letting their, you know, feelings be felt, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4764.9400000000005s)]
*  and voicing their angst and sorrow, you know? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4767.94s)]
*  And I think some pressure was applied, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4772.26s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, for the, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4775.0199999999995s)]
*  as far as the pain pills, to tighten up on that. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4776.26s)]
*  But then now, here comes this fentanyl shit. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4780.26s)]
*  But even before that, I mean, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4784.22s)]
*  they got selling heroin in Huntsville, Alabama, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4787.42s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4790.26s)]
*  Like, this shit's all over the place, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4791.099999999999s)]
*  but the pills were cleaned up to a large measure, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4792.94s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4797.58s)]
*  But, and it's just interesting, you know what I'm saying? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4798.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4801.9s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked if our government [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4803.0599999999995s)]
*  is selling our own drugs to it. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4804.94s)]
*  I wouldn't, or somebody is, some bigger picture. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4806.46s)]
*  Who knows who it could be? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4809.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, it could be some corporation [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4810.179999999999s)]
*  that just has that much pool, and, you know, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4811.86s)]
*  they just, you know, funded this one campaign [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4814.219999999999s)]
*  of this one person who has the influence. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4817.299999999999s)]
*  Who knows, you know what I'm saying? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4819.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I said, I can only speculate, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4821.18s)]
*  because they damn sure don't invite me to the meetings. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4823.26s)]
*  Whatever kind of shit they're running. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4826.1s)]
*  Got any email. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4827.5s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4829.820000000001s)]
*  You know, and so I don't know, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4831.46s)]
*  but those things, what Arsenio Hall used to say, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4834.34s)]
*  things that make you go, hmm. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4837.26s)]

*  that was a real highlight for me. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4841.14s)]
*  Oh man, that would have been the shit. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4841.9800000000005s)]
*  When his show came back on, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4843.18s)]
*  that was the first show I ever got to do [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4844.14s)]
*  stand-up comedy on, was Arsenio. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4845.3s)]
*  Arsenio, man, that was so epic when I was young. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4846.820000000001s)]
*  Dude, it was huge, man. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4849.86s)]
*  And then in Living Color, bruh. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4851.58s)]
*  Yeah, Living Color. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4853.22s)]

*  I remember when Jay Leno took over for me, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4860.98s)]
*  and I actually ended up doing the Jay Leno show. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4863.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4865.5s)]

*  Uh-uh, not bad at all. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4881.7s)]
*  Man, you know, my old high school football coach [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4883.54s)]

*  You know, and that's something that just [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4891.5s)]
*  stuck with me through life, you know what I'm saying? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4893.06s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4908.14s)]
*  Like they say, you put your socks on one leg at a time [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4908.98s)]
*  just like everybody else. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4911.42s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4933.22s)]
*  That's always been really hard. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4934.66s)]
*  Anybody that says that they don't [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4935.82s)]
*  is either just not cursed with any self-awareness, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4938.22s)]
*  and some people are just like that. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4941.46s)]
*  Sometimes the biggest stars just, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4942.46s)]
*  they don't have self-awareness. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4944.06s)]
*  They don't. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4945.66s)]
*  Right, so they're not even thinking about the beginning. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4946.5s)]
*  Yeah, but how do they, how are people perceiving them? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4947.82s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4950.1s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4954.46s)]
*  That's just the way it is with everything, but. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4955.3s)]
*  But yeah, I wish that didn't, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4956.9400000000005s)]
*  cause here's what I wish I had a little bit more of my own. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4959.54s)]
*  I wish I had a bit more somebody helping me [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4963.06s)]
*  build my own self-worth when I was young, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4965.580000000001s)]
*  so I had a little bit more. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4967.5s)]
*  It just wasn't a part of the culture of growing up. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4969.42s)]
*  You know, like. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4972.06s)]
*  Yeah, but some people got it because they're, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4972.900000000001s)]
*  you know, somebody told, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4975.14s)]
*  I just feel like some people got it. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4976.5s)]
*  I'm not like having a pity party. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4978.14s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4979.700000000001s)]
*  I just wish that I had a little more of it. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4980.54s)]
*  That's the reason, and it's tragic that you don't have kids. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4982.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4984.9800000000005s)]
*  It's tragic that I don't have, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4985.820000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of, and that's what we talk about, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4987.42s)]
*  that gap between males and females [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4989.9s)]
*  that keeps getting wider and wider, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4993.0199999999995s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4994.58s)]
*  In the way that we connect with one another, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4995.7s)]
*  it just, what's your cash up? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4997.46s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=4999.3s)]

*  it seems like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5005.38s)]
*  And so I don't, since I got divorced in 2019, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5006.58s)]
*  I haven't seriously dated anybody [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5009.74s)]
*  because I don't know how to fucking date in this world, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5011.5s)]
*  but that's a whole other story. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5013.58s)]
*  But I'm saying we're over 40, you know what I'm saying? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5015.219999999999s)]
*  And so like. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5018.34s)]
*  I mean, I just know a lot. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5019.58s)]
*  We gotta get a fucking kid, bro. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5020.42s)]
*  I know a lot of real deal men that need to have kids, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5022.46s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5025.38s)]
*  Because I would like to know what a child with my stuff, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5026.22s)]
*  I love my parents, man. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5030.34s)]
*  This isn't no, they did the best they could [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5031.58s)]
*  with what they were equipped with, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5034.38s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5037.26s)]
*  What they'd been given, and they did a great job [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5038.1s)]
*  because I've done a lot of things, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5039.9400000000005s)]
*  and they're a part of that, you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5041.9800000000005s)]
*  And they love me, but as far as just [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5043.740000000001s)]
*  like believing in a child and giving him the freedom [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5047.42s)]
*  to really express himself and encouraging him, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5051.82s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5054.86s)]
*  And still being stern, you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5055.7s)]
*  And being a disciplinarian, but just not discouraging dreams, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5058.099999999999s)]
*  and you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5064.0599999999995s)]
*  And they were just trying to protect me, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5065.259999999999s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5067.179999999999s)]
*  By discouraging dreams, by saying that's just silly, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5068.0199999999995s)]
*  foolishness, you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5072.179999999999s)]
*  Like you need to have a different plan, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5073.299999999999s)]
*  you need to have a practical plan, one that's realistic, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5076.74s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5079.26s)]
*  They were just trying to, you know? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5080.1s)]
*  But I know now that all that's bullshit, that's programming, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5081.78s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5086.3s)]
*  That's fear-based programming, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5087.14s)]
*  and we can do a lot in this world. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5089.34s)]
*  You know what, you're evidence of it. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5092.34s)]
*  And so for us to have children and be able to just, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5094.46s)]
*  and it might go all awry. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5098.5s)]
*  It might go awry. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5101.18s)]
*  Like, because we might, they might, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5102.38s)]
*  because there's some craziness to the way we're wired too, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5104.06s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5106.580000000001s)]
*  And they might, a little too much love [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5107.42s)]
*  and not quite enough rigid upbringing [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5109.620000000001s)]
*  might make it where they just go be hellions or something. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5111.580000000001s)]
*  Right, we might go the other way. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5114.02s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, I just know a lot of men [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5115.18s)]
*  that Paul O'Donnell, Cliff Kingsbury, friends of mine, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5118.700000000001s)]
*  over 40 and don't have kids. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5122.38s)]
*  Cliff that coaches Cardinals? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5124.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's my boy, man. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5125.620000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, really? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5126.46s)]
*  Shout out to Cliff, man. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5127.5s)]
*  Yeah, dude, Cliff is a king, bro. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5128.34s)]
*  We got to be real cool when he was coaching at Texas Tech [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5129.700000000001s)]
*  before he got that job, man. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5132.74s)]
*  And that's a great fellow right there, man. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5135.219999999999s)]
*  He seems real cool, man. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5137.34s)]
*  He's a stand up guy, man. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5138.46s)]
*  I'm telling you, every area. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5139.66s)]
*  I think Cliff Kingsbury should run for president, honestly. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5141.3s)]
*  Gang, bro. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5143.82s)]
*  I mean, he's just that kind of guy. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5144.66s)]
*  Like, man, he can just relate to anybody. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5145.82s)]
*  He's a principled guy. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5148.98s)]
*  His principles don't get compromised for anything. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5150.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5153.46s)]
*  He stands on what he stands for. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5154.3s)]
*  And you know what, I'm just using him as an example. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5156.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, Paul O'Donnell, great guy, you know what I'm saying? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5159.0599999999995s)]
*  And he's a brother of mine. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5161.1s)]
*  Not friend, but a brother. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5164.26s)]
*  Super producer, produced 32, 33 number one records. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5165.780000000001s)]
*  You know, you don't have kids. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5169.42s)]
*  I don't have kids. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5170.620000000001s)]
*  You don't have kids. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5171.700000000001s)]
*  It's just, that was almost unheard of, you know, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5172.54s)]
*  like in the 1950s or whatever. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5175.42s)]
*  Oh, you had to have kids? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5177.660000000001s)]
*  It's the only thing you did. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5178.780000000001s)]
*  You know, I worry sometimes that honestly, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5180.06s)]
*  I think I worry that if I did have kids, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5182.9400000000005s)]
*  that there would be a, I'd somehow do the same thing. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5186.58s)]
*  I think. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5192.0199999999995s)]
*  I think there's probably some fear of that. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5192.86s)]
*  My girlfriend was pregnant at one time. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5193.86s)]
*  This is like 2006. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5197.62s)]
*  Yeah, like right around that same new booty time [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5200.3s)]
*  when everything was coming to a head. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5202.22s)]
*  And she had a miscarriage at, I think it was like four months. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5204.46s)]
*  And just in those four months, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5209.34s)]
*  I know the way I felt, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5211.82s)]
*  thinking I was getting ready to be a father, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5215.02s)]
*  man, it's a different feeling, man. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5217.740000000001s)]
*  Like, it's like, I gotta get my shit together [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5221.14s)]
*  because I can let myself down, you know what I'm saying? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5223.660000000001s)]
*  But I can't let a mini me down. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5225.9400000000005s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5228.14s)]
*  I gotta get it right, get it tight [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5228.9800000000005s)]
*  for this little joker right here. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5230.9800000000005s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5232.34s)]
*  I can't be playing about another life that's, you know, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5233.18s)]
*  and I can only imagine a child being born [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5236.3s)]
*  and looking at that child and seeing yourself in it, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5239.26s)]
*  like some physical thing, your eyes or something. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5241.740000000001s)]
*  I can only imagine how that would feel. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5244.219999999999s)]
*  And I never thought I wouldn't have kids, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5245.98s)]
*  but I was kind of careful back in the quote unquote heyday [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5248.5s)]
*  because I had so many friends [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5251.78s)]
*  that had multiple baby mamas [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5252.82s)]
*  and everybody's life was just miserable [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5254.259999999999s)]
*  when that was the case, you know what I'm saying? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5256.62s)]
*  Like three baby mamas and they got two other baby dads, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5258.299999999999s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5262.82s)]
*  And it's just, it's not good on a child. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5263.66s)]
*  It's like Red Rover at Thanksgiving, yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5265.5s)]
*  So I didn't want that. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5266.78s)]
*  I didn't wanna be a part of perpetuating that type of deal. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5268.219999999999s)]
*  And so I was, you know, and then God bless my ex-wife. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5272.14s)]
*  I think maybe with us, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5276.14s)]
*  just by the time we actually got married, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5277.42s)]
*  maybe we were already kind of coming unraveled [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5279.3s)]
*  and it just, spiritually, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5282.1s)]
*  it just never lined up the right way. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5283.660000000001s)]
*  You think it'll still happen? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5287.620000000001s)]
*  Do you think about it? I haven't given up. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5289.22s)]
*  I'm not too thrilled about the prospects [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5290.58s)]
*  of being 86 years old at my child's high school graduation. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5293.3s)]
*  But you know. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5296.900000000001s)]
*  My dad was 70 when I was born, which is crazy, man. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5298.18s)]
*  Pops, pops. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5300.74s)]
*  That's what's up. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5302.82s)]
*  I only say that just cause I keep finding myself [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5303.66s)]

*  But nobody knew for three days, but it was like. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5893.72s)]
*  Wow, what's the point of doing that? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5896.120000000001s)]
*  I think just I wanted to create some ambiance or something. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5898.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, okay, gotcha. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5900.92s)]
*  And. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5902.240000000001s)]
*  You wanna create some like, what do you call it? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5903.08s)]
*  Like not nostalgia, but like morale. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5904.88s)]
*  Yeah, we're in this, huh? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5907.84s)]
*  Let's do it for Jay, huh? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5908.96s)]
*  And, but I don't know what I was even talking about. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5910.84s)]
*  But so take me through, yeah, so let's just, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5914.4s)]
*  so I wanna be able to relate. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5917.5199999999995s)]
*  A lot of our audience struggles with addiction [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5918.8s)]
*  and just different things. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5921.16s)]
*  That's a lot of our audience. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5922.16s)]
*  A lot of people do nowadays. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5923.44s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5925.08s)]
*  You know, they were saying the other day, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5925.92s)]
*  70% of adults in America are on one medication [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5927.44s)]
*  or at least were on medication. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5932.72s)]
*  So what effects did you feel like it had on you [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5935.28s)]
*  as you started to realize? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5937.96s)]
*  So here's the deal. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5939.799999999999s)]
*  All right, so when I first went to rehab and I got out, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5940.639999999999s)]
*  like that was the height of my career. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5943.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5945.44s)]
*  I just, you know. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5946.28s)]
*  How hard was it to be in rehab [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5947.12s)]
*  while your career was at the height? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5948.32s)]
*  That's the time when I was like trying to fuck everything [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5950.36s)]
*  with the vagina and breasts and stuff. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5953.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5956.08s)]
*  So I was kinda on that tip. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5956.92s)]
*  Like I remember like, but that's when I, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5958.759999999999s)]
*  honestly when I got over being a homophobe [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5961.36s)]
*  because there were a lot of people, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5966.16s)]
*  I kinda went down there on some arrogant stuff. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5968.36s)]
*  I'm withdrawing and I'm like, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5970.2s)]
*  yeah I heard y'all like to make people rule [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5971.8s)]
*  with gay people too. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5974.36s)]
*  Put me in no room with no gay people. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5975.5199999999995s)]
*  Really? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5977.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5978.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was, man I'm from, you know what I'm saying? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5978.84s)]
*  I'm from the South, man. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5980.64s)]
*  Like I'm a pretty enlightened guy [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5981.68s)]
*  but I just, I'd never been around any gay people [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5984.68s)]
*  to be honest with you. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5986.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5987.8s)]
*  I remember we wasn't around any gays until later. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5988.64s)]
*  So we fear what we don't, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5991.56s)]
*  what we haven't been exposed to, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5992.400000000001s)]
*  what we don't understand, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5993.8s)]
*  what just a certain like presentation [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5994.68s)]
*  and depiction of something that we receive. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=5998.12s)]
*  And you know, and one of the coolest, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6000.6s)]
*  couple of cool cats that I was in treatment with [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6003.92s)]
*  were gay men and they, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6007.52s)]
*  some of the best people I've ever known to this day. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6009.12s)]
*  And it just, you know what I'm saying? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6011.52s)]
*  It's like I was always so focused on black folks [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6012.4800000000005s)]
*  and white folks because that's really what I was [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6015.360000000001s)]
*  in the mud with, you know what I'm saying? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6018.68s)]
*  But then I would be, could be judgmental in some other way [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6021.4800000000005s)]
*  to some other group of people. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6024.64s)]
*  It just, it was just so flawed me, you know what I'm saying? [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6025.84s)]
*  But I've been around that experience [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6028.72s)]
*  and meeting those guys and then countless other gay folks [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6031.120000000001s)]
*  since then that I've had the pleasure of knowing, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6035.8s)]
*  you know, I'm just not fucked up with it. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6038.200000000001s)]
*  I don't care, as long as you don't harm children, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6040.64s)]
*  elderly people, mentally handicapped people, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6044.64s)]
*  animals or just people that can't defend themselves. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6046.96s)]
*  I'm not really judging a lot in this world, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6050.4800000000005s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6052.68s)]
*  Because I don't know what the hell you've been through. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6053.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6055.08s)]
*  I don't know what it's like inside your head [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6055.92s)]
*  and what your experiences have shaped you into becoming, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6057.0s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6060.6s)]
*  But there's just certain lines you can't cross, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6061.52s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6063.64s)]
*  And that's just the way it is. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6064.4800000000005s)]
*  Because if you do, we gotta get you out of here. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6065.320000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6067.6s)]
*  Like you can't be messing with children [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6068.4400000000005s)]
*  and you just can't be just recklessly, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6069.92s)]
*  just pillaging humanity, helpless humanity. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6075.64s)]
*  So after- [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6081.32s)]
*  So you went to the rehab. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6083.36s)]
*  Yeah, I blamed the music industry and music for it. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6084.2s)]
*  So I went two years without doing music. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6088.4400000000005s)]
*  I didn't really go to the studio one day. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6091.76s)]
*  I was going to NA meetings. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6093.72s)]
*  I mean, I was going to 12-step recovery meetings. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6095.68s)]
*  Were you getting better? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6101.4s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6102.84s)]
*  But at the same time, I wasn't, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6103.84s)]
*  I was pretty much just, I had some pretty good- [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6107.0s)]
*  At that time, I had some pretty good recovery. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6109.76s)]
*  But you know what it was, man? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6113.08s)]
*  I just wasn't, I was just sitting there. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6114.240000000001s)]
*  You know, and it got to a point where [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6117.92s)]
*  I started going to do shows [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6119.72s)]
*  and it was kind of tormenting, like, you know, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6122.16s)]
*  going in these clubs and just not being, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6124.68s)]
*  that atmosphere of recovery internally, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6128.0s)]
*  it just got weaker and weaker and weaker. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6131.84s)]
*  But it got to the point where clean and sober, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6135.360000000001s)]
*  like I really wanted to check out of here, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6138.360000000001s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6139.88s)]
*  Because it just, I guess I just hadn't [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6140.72s)]
*  stuck around long enough for that spiritual change [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6143.76s)]
*  to happen or whatever, even though it was a long time, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6147.360000000001s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, over a year. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6152.08s)]
*  And I don't know, it just was really, really excruciating [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6154.52s)]
*  and I was just white-knuckling it [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6159.88s)]
*  and finally I was just, I had no, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6162.320000000001s)]
*  it was either pick up a pistol or pick up a drink. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6164.64s)]
*  But you know, I can say that like, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6169.68s)]
*  you know, then the next time it was like, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6173.0s)]
*  drinking really became an issue, you know what I'm saying? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6175.88s)]
*  I didn't go back to the pills or anything like that, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6178.080000000001s)]
*  but being an addict, like, I'll make anything enough [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6180.280000000001s)]
*  if that's all there is, you know what I'm saying? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6184.92s)]
*  Or if I've got myself convinced that that's all, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6187.320000000001s)]
*  you know, all that I can allow myself to do. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6190.88s)]
*  You know, I can make anything, literally, like sex, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6195.28s)]
*  you know, like any external thing, man. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6198.2s)]
*  Like if I like something, I'm probably gonna do it [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6200.52s)]
*  till it makes me sick, you know what I'm saying? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6203.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah man, I can do that, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6206.24s)]
*  I can totally relate to that, man. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6207.64s)]
*  I will find anything to take me out of the present moment, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6210.12s)]
*  you know, to kind of take me away from having to just. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6213.4s)]
*  The McRibs are back for a month, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6215.16s)]
*  I'm just gonna eat them until I vomit. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6216.92s)]

*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6537.799999999999s)]
*  And some discipline, you know, like they say, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6538.68s)]
*  we're gonna suffer pain. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6541.4800000000005s)]
*  It's either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6543.04s)]
*  And I've suffered the pain of discipline at times [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6545.8s)]
*  and I reap the benefits. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6548.400000000001s)]
*  And I've not been disciplined at times, you know, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6550.280000000001s)]
*  and unavoidably, yeah, the pain of regret, man. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6554.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard, man. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6558.240000000001s)]
*  It's also hard, you know, it's not also like it's easy, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6561.240000000001s)]
*  but man, I can just totally relate. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6563.88s)]
*  You know, and nobody's got, like everybody is saddled [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6565.4400000000005s)]
*  with something, you know what I'm saying? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6568.44s)]
*  So just because a person doesn't have the same issues [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6569.879999999999s)]
*  that I have, and that's true humility, you know what I'm [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6573.48s)]
*  saying, is that self-awareness of understanding that, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6577.04s)]
*  you know, I used to think humility was like acting inferior [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6579.5599999999995s)]
*  when you really thought you were superior, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6582.32s)]
*  like being sheepish, like, oh no, this whole thing, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6584.28s)]
*  you know, or just whatever, like, no, I'm not cute, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6587.759999999999s)]
*  whatever the fuck, you know what I'm saying? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6591.36s)]
*  Just not taking compliments well, all that kind of shit. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6592.719999999999s)]
*  Like, that's being humble to me, you know what I'm saying? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6595.48s)]
*  Like, but I've come to learn, you know, as I've grown [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6597.36s)]
*  and experienced life, that humility is more like just kind [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6602.92s)]
*  of like a true understanding of self. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6607.96s)]
*  Like, I got some good qualities about me, you know what I'm [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6610.28s)]
*  saying, I got some good shit going on, man. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6612.639999999999s)]
*  But I also got some fucked up shit, like, that I need [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6614.96s)]
*  to work on, you know what I'm saying? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6617.839999999999s)]
*  And I'm in the process with it, with working on those things. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6619.32s)]
*  And I'm okay with where I'm at. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6622.839999999999s)]
*  And I understand that I'm no better or worse [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6625.0s)]
*  than anybody else, you know what I'm saying? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6627.08s)]
*  People just have, some people don't ever identify [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6628.76s)]
*  their strengths, you know, or, you know, they, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6631.6s)]
*  it doesn't register with them that, dang, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6634.8s)]
*  this is how I can benefit from my strengths, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6636.96s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6639.64s)]
*  Like, I can make a living or help others or whatever, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6640.46s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6643.56s)]
*  And so, they just never turn them up or like shine that light [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6644.4s)]
*  on them and get them all the way, you know, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6647.84s)]
*  hitting on all cylinders. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6649.52s)]
*  But, you know, I've just been in instances where [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6651.48s)]
*  other people, you know, like I'm good in a social setting, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6655.679999999999s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6658.679999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm a cocktail party superstar, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6659.5199999999995s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6662.48s)]
*  Like, you know, just, I can shoot the shit with anybody, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6663.32s)]
*  man, I get that from my pops, man. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6665.879999999999s)]
*  And so, people that aren't good in those types of settings, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6667.679999999999s)]
*  that aren't like personable people like that, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6672.5199999999995s)]
*  I used to kind of maybe like look down on them a little bit, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6675.5199999999995s)]
*  like, oh man, you just ain't fly with it like me, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6678.48s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6680.44s)]
*  Like, until I was in a situation, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6681.28s)]
*  I'm not gonna speak on what the situation exactly entailed, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6683.839999999999s)]
*  but where I was completely lost. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6688.4s)]
*  And a person that maybe I looked down on [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6692.04s)]
*  because they didn't have the social, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6694.48s)]
*  quote unquote, social skills that I had, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6696.0s)]
*  was in their element and it saved my ass big time, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6698.28s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6702.96s)]
*  And it just further like hammered that point home, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6703.799999999999s)]
*  like, we all got some shit that we're good at, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6706.2s)]
*  we all got some shit we need to work on, man, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6710.679999999999s)]
*  we're all humans, you know, it's not. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6712.36s)]
*  We're all gonna need each other. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6714.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I promise you we are, man. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6715.5599999999995s)]
*  I know. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6717.8s)]
*  I promise you, you know what I'm saying? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6718.639999999999s)]
*  It's just like any time, whatever group that you say, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6719.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, like, they're the problem, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6723.04s)]
*  I promise you, you're gonna be in a situation [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6725.44s)]
*  where you need somebody from that group. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6727.16s)]
*  I promise you, I've seen it too many times. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6729.16s)]
*  I mean, it's just, that's just the way [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6731.48s)]
*  the universe sorts shit out or God sorts things out, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6733.5199999999995s)]
*  like, however you wanna look at that, you know, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6736.4s)]
*  but I've seen it pop up repeatedly in my life [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6738.4s)]
*  and just, you know, other people [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6741.96s)]
*  that wanted to be judgmental, you know, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6744.4s)]
*  because we just, we all, it makes us feel better [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6745.96s)]
*  to some degree to be able to just blame other people [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6748.28s)]
*  for, you know, something that is not going right, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6750.4s)]
*  you know, in our own lives, but, you know, it's bullshit. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6753.96s)]
*  Life just go life, man. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6756.96s)]
*  Yeah, and it's interesting, like you said in the beginning, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6758.92s)]
*  like, if you could look at life [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6760.759999999999s)]
*  through a whole spectrum of time, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6762.32s)]
*  it's unfortunate we're only able to see life a lot of times, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6764.639999999999s)]
*  or a lot of us are, just as right now. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6767.48s)]
*  We're not able to see the past 3,000 years. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6770.08s)]
*  We're not able to see it all. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6772.96s)]
*  It's always right now. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6773.799999999999s)]
*  Right, and if we could get a whole, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6775.16s)]
*  if we could really spend life like this [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6777.28s)]
*  and look at the spectrum of things, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6779.24s)]
*  it would give us all a unique perspective, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6781.2s)]
*  and maybe that's the perspective that's coming along [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6783.0s)]
*  in the future, like you were saying. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6785.04s)]
*  Yeah, because I think even like, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6786.4s)]
*  when I was talking about visiting battlefields [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6787.879999999999s)]
*  of old battles and stuff, I think there's obviously becomes [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6789.879999999999s)]
*  like a sicko element to it. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6792.879999999999s)]
*  They just go back and just like, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6794.36s)]
*  they're just there with like this hot chick or something. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6796.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6798.879999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna take this broad out to the yin dynasty or something. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6799.719999999999s)]
*  Now this joker's gonna figure out, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6804.2s)]
*  not even that though, but like people going back in time, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6805.5599999999995s)]
*  like jerking off. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6809.0s)]
*  Yeah, type shit. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6810.44s)]
*  Dang, bro, that's gonna be sad, man. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6815.2s)]
*  But that's just humans, man. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6817.879999999999s)]
*  But you gonna have some dude going back in the- [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6819.24s)]
*  The ultimate beauty, humans, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6821.04s)]
*  we encompass the ultimate beauty, you know what I'm saying? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6822.719999999999s)]
*  And the ultimate fucking ugliness, man. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6826.6s)]
*  It's like, you know, our greatest gift is probably, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6828.64s)]
*  if you were some evolved alien species, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6832.64s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, just looking at us, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6836.12s)]
*  you'd be so envious of the fact [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6837.8s)]
*  that we can feel the way we feel. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6840.32s)]
*  Because if you'd evolved to a point where- [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6842.8s)]
*  So far, you can't even feel. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6844.76s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have, there's no love, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6846.0s)]
*  there's no emotion in you. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6847.6s)]
*  It's all just like logic and survival, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6848.76s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6851.4s)]
*  Yeah, imagine an alien comes back just to see [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6852.48s)]
*  like a mother hug a child. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6854.4s)]
*  Yeah, or to see somebody crying [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6856.24s)]
*  because their girlfriend broke up with them. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6858.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and they can't even have tears anymore. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6860.24s)]
*  And they've actually evolved into just being one gender [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6861.719999999999s)]
*  and they spawn every spring [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6864.2s)]
*  and that's how the new gene pool, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6866.92s)]
*  that's how the new- [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6869.96s)]
*  New booty. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6870.799999999999s)]
*  New people come, yeah. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6871.639999999999s)]
*  So there's no, it's just one gender. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6872.879999999999s)]
*  Like it evolved into that. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6875.36s)]
*  That's ultimately what it feels like [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6876.679999999999s)]
*  we're kind of being prompted towards. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6878.2s)]
*  I know. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6879.759999999999s)]
*  You know, but- [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6880.599999999999s)]
*  Somebody come all the way back in time [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6881.44s)]
*  just to see a breast or somebody's dick. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6882.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6885.400000000001s)]
*  Because they don't have it. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6886.24s)]
*  Just envious of just like, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6887.68s)]
*  but also like, man, y'all are stupid as hell. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6889.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6891.4400000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6892.28s)]
*  Y'all feel shit. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6893.2s)]
*  Why do y'all wanna feel shit? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6894.36s)]
*  Y'all still feeling? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6895.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6896.04s)]
*  Damn, y'all feel, that's so played out. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6896.88s)]
*  Man, feeling. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6898.72s)]
*  Look at these people still feeling. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6899.56s)]
*  That's why y'all keep damn blowing up shit [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6900.64s)]
*  and doing everything [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6902.72s)]
*  because y'all being y'all's feelings and shit, you know? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6903.56s)]
*  So there's something to be said for, you know, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6905.76s)]
*  you couldn't imagine a life without emotion and feelings [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6907.36s)]
*  and it kind of is what drives us, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6910.52s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6912.2s)]
*  But I mean, it's just the double-edged sword [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6913.04s)]
*  that pretty much comes along with anything [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6917.48s)]
*  if you think about it. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6919.5599999999995s)]
*  Dude, I think you have such a, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6921.08s)]
*  I just am fascinated by your perspective, man. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6925.24s)]
*  The perspectives you've been able to live through [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6927.2s)]
*  and the perspective that you've been able to [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6929.4s)]
*  not create for yourself, but [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6935.36s)]
*  learn and evolve into as you've grown. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6938.08s)]
*  I don't rule anything out, man. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6942.8s)]
*  And I just, I'm teachable, you know what I'm saying? [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6944.12s)]
*  That's one thing that I committed [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6947.76s)]
*  to always just be coachable and teachable [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6949.4s)]
*  because please present me with some, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6951.4s)]
*  I beg anyone out there, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6953.8s)]
*  present me with some new information [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6955.28s)]
*  that either improves upon some bad or dated information [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6957.5599999999995s)]
*  that I'm using, you know what I'm saying? [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6961.8s)]
*  Like please give me some new information. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6963.28s)]
*  If my information's wrong, I welcome it. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6965.84s)]
*  I encourage it, I need it, you know what I'm saying? [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6968.6s)]
*  And sometimes it may not come from the people [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6971.360000000001s)]
*  that you would want it to come from [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6973.96s)]
*  and the way you would want it to come, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6975.12s)]
*  but hey, I can't tell help how to help me, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6976.4800000000005s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6979.320000000001s)]
*  Like so, you know, and that's just about, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6980.16s)]
*  I just wish more people would just be [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6982.92s)]
*  unconditionally open-minded, you know, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6984.88s)]
*  because man, it's just, you know, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6986.96s)]
*  I got into astrology recently, you know, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6989.92s)]
*  or in the past couple years [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6992.6s)]
*  and really started learning more about it, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6993.96s)]
*  even though for most of my life I was like, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6996.64s)]
*  eh, whatever, I just use it as a way to pick up girls. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=6998.44s)]
*  What's your sign? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7001.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, what's your sign? [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7002.24s)]
*  Or look at that. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7003.36s)]
*  Yeah, just a conversation starter. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7004.2s)]
*  But it's starting to make sense to me [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7005.36s)]
*  that in the future it could be, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7008.92s)]
*  certain aspects of astrology could be looked at as science [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7012.2s)]
*  because it only makes sense to me that now, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7015.08s)]
*  if you were born at a certain time of year, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7017.96s)]
*  in a certain place, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7020.64s)]
*  the air pressure was, you know, this at that time, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7022.04s)]
*  the humidity level, like all these things [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7025.36s)]
*  that we may not know, they could have a major impact [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7027.08s)]
*  on the way a human mind and body and spirit develops. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7030.68s)]
*  You know, I just think that it's gonna be in the future [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7036.36s)]
*  at some point, it's gonna be a lot more credence [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7039.0s)]
*  to stuff like that, you know what I'm saying? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7041.72s)]
*  Like, and I think whereas religion, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7043.32s)]
*  not religion, I don't even, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7047.72s)]
*  religion is just a man-made, in my opinion, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7049.4s)]
*  just something that man-made is a way to, you know, to. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7052.04s)]
*  Try and connect to a higher power. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7056.92s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't even think it was that. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7058.5199999999995s)]
*  I think man can connect to a higher power by himself, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7061.04s)]
*  or by herself. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7066.04s)]
*  But I think in some ways religion was just [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7067.28s)]
*  to control people, you know what I'm saying? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7070.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, when you look at various religious institutions, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7072.24s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to say that, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7077.08s)]
*  what did they say in that movie, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7081.88s)]
*  the Da Vinci Code or something like that? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7083.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, I just watched that. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7086.68s)]
*  Well, he was like, he was like, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7087.5199999999995s)]
*  asked the guy about God and he said, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7090.24s)]
*  no, don't tell me what man has told you about God, [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7092.04s)]
*  tell me what you think about God, you know what I'm saying? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7096.0s)]
*  And it's like, man, it's like anything I'm told by a man, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7098.44s)]
*  I'm just, men are flawed, you know what I'm saying? [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7102.5199999999995s)]
*  Men and women are very flawed, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7106.04s)]
*  so who knows what kind of bullshit might be attached [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7107.28s)]
*  to the reason that they're telling me this? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7110.68s)]
*  And that's not to say that I'm just, would rule it out, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7113.84s)]
*  but it's just to say, I can't just accept it [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7115.96s)]
*  as just what it is, as my concrete fundamental truth. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7118.52s)]
*  But religion's helped a lot of people, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7122.08s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7124.88s)]
*  And my mother and father are Christian, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7125.72s)]
*  and I'm a Christian, I would say, you know what I'm saying? [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7129.56s)]
*  But I'm just not gonna just, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7132.2s)]
*  you ain't gonna just piss down my back, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7136.44s)]
*  tell me it's raining, and me be like, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7137.76s)]
*  okay, no, it's raining, you know what I'm saying? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7139.12s)]
*  I'm gonna investigate things for myself, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7141.08s)]
*  I'm gonna think for myself. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7142.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, some of that's piss. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7143.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7145.32s)]
*  It's warm. Yeah, I feel you. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7146.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know, okay, yeah, it's warm, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7147.96s)]
*  and why three of y'all standing back there? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7150.04s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7151.76s)]
*  Why three or four of y'all standing? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7152.8s)]
*  I know y'all been drinking them beer all day, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7153.92s)]
*  like y'all ain't got out the pool one time. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7155.92s)]
*  Bro, you and Riff Raff gotta get together and talk, man. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7158.12s)]
*  I would listen to that for hours. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7161.12s)]
*  Oh, I love to talk to him, man. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7162.599999999999s)]
*  Y'all sound so much like the same. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7164.12s)]
*  We gotta get up, man, for real. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7165.8s)]
*  Dude, yeah, I just feel so grateful [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7167.72s)]
*  to have gotten to spend time with you and... [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7170.16s)]
*  Yeah, it means a lot, man, that we finally got to do this, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7172.5199999999995s)]
*  because it's a long time coming, for sure. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7175.64s)]
*  Yeah, we should go grab something [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7177.32s)]
*  y'all gonna eat or something. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7178.48s)]
*  Yeah, we'd love to get something to eat. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7179.5599999999995s)]
*  We'll go right down the street. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7180.84s)]
*  If you wanna check out more music, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7182.16s)]
*  what else can they expect, what's going on? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7183.4s)]
*  Honestly, I've put out music, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7186.32s)]
*  with the exception of the two years that I was talking about, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7188.48s)]
*  which really set me back, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7191.88s)]
*  because that was at a time when the internet [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7192.96s)]
*  was starting to dictate musical styles and trends [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7194.64s)]
*  evolving at a much more rapid rate. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7198.48s)]
*  So, and that was like the worst time to take two years off. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7200.44s)]
*  So it took me a while to just get caught up. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7203.84s)]
*  And honestly, I feel like I'm better now than I've ever been. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7205.84s)]
*  I was blessed to work with some really great producers [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7209.12s)]
*  early on, and so I was good. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7211.08s)]
*  Always, but I benefited from working [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7214.2s)]
*  with some great people, whereas now, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7216.24s)]
*  I'm able to be a more self-contained entity. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7218.759999999999s)]
*  I can go in the studio by myself and write a hit. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7222.5599999999995s)]
*  Every aspect of it. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7226.5599999999995s)]
*  But I'm putting out music pretty consistently, man. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7228.919999999999s)]
*  I'll get in a lull for a year or so, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7231.919999999999s)]
*  maybe do some other stuff, and then just at some point, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7236.44s)]
*  I'm gonna get riled back up on it, man, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7240.84s)]
*  because it just calls me, you know what I'm saying? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7242.400000000001s)]
*  It's that real to me. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7244.84s)]
*  And you're fortunate, as long as I'm breathing on this planet, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7246.68s)]
*  if you like listening to my music, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7250.68s)]
*  if it just doesn't make you vomit, you know what I'm saying? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7253.080000000001s)]
*  The good news is, as long as I'm breathing, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7256.200000000001s)]
*  as long as my mental faculties will allow me to do so, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7258.76s)]
*  I'm gonna be rapping. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7261.320000000001s)]
*  Are there other, yeah, because there's no one that sounds, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7262.84s)]
*  there is no one that's a rapper, [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7267.6s)]
*  there is no one that sounds, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7269.2s)]
*  there is no one still that sounds like you. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7270.4s)]
*  I was listening to a bunch of your music this week, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7273.24s)]
*  and there was, I can't even explain it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7275.08s)]
*  And I don't think it needs to be explained, that's why. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7278.96s)]
*  Well, you know, man, it's like, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7281.36s)]
*  what I like about the way you do your thing, man, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7282.4s)]
*  is it's like, honestly, [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7284.5599999999995s)]
*  the first episode I ever saw was Boosie. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7287.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7290.4s)]
*  And it was just dope, man. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7291.36s)]
*  I was like, this is weird to me. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7292.84s)]
*  Like, why is, like, this is just strange to me. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7294.599999999999s)]
*  And then you started talking, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7296.84s)]
*  I realized you were from Baton Rouge, like everything. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7298.08s)]
*  And I was like, this is fucking New South as fuck, man. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7299.84s)]
*  This is like dope as hell, you know what I'm saying? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7303.28s)]
*  I started getting into just the authentic way, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7305.6s)]
*  because look, every person that's ever been born [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7308.08s)]
*  into this world has something unique about them [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7310.4s)]
*  that sets them apart from every other person [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7313.8s)]
*  that's ever been born into this world. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7315.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7318.12s)]
*  We all have something in us [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7318.96s)]
*  that just separates us from everybody else, [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7320.76s)]
*  doesn't make us better or worse, just makes us us. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7322.32s)]
*  And to me, great art, whether you're a quarterback, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7325.68s)]
*  a painter, a musician, a comedian, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7328.16s)]
*  great art is about the ability to make whatever it is [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7332.4400000000005s)]
*  that makes you unique and different [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7335.400000000001s)]
*  from everybody else in special, translate into your art. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7337.280000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7340.360000000001s)]
*  And so I just really get off when I encounter people [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7341.200000000001s)]
*  or when I'm able to observe cats that are doing that. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7344.72s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7348.6s)]
*  It's like, dang, man. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7349.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, nobody can compete with that. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7350.280000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7352.08s)]
*  If you just truly get in your own lane [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7352.92s)]
*  and even the attempt to compete with it is a loss. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7354.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7358.96s)]
*  It's like, you just can't be another person. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7359.8s)]
*  And we're all inspired and influenced by others. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7362.72s)]
*  That's not to say I have influences, many influences. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7365.280000000001s)]
*  I get influenced by things every day. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7369.68s)]
*  And I'm not scared to, like I said, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7371.400000000001s)]
*  give me some new information, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7374.16s)]
*  inspire me in a different way, whatever. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7375.88s)]
*  Yeah, but to really be, that's the scariest thing, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7377.92s)]
*  I think, is to try and be yourself. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7380.96s)]
*  And that's so fascinating that. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7384.12s)]
*  So when you do finally learn who you really are [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7386.4s)]
*  and embrace it and accept it, you cherish it, man. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7389.72s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7392.88s)]
*  You cherish it. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7393.72s)]
*  And you definitely, I'm sympathetic and empathetic [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7394.5599999999995s)]
*  to people that haven't been able to discover themselves [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7398.4s)]
*  or embrace who they truly are, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7402.0s)]
*  because I know people out here that can't, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7404.48s)]
*  that haven't been able to do it for themselves. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7408.04s)]
*  So they vent that angst from not being able [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7409.68s)]
*  to figure it out for themselves by judging [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7415.04s)]
*  and throwing stones at other people. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7417.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's just the way it's gonna go, man. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7419.2s)]
*  It's just hurt people hurt people, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7422.44s)]
*  but in the lost, people get people lost. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7424.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7428.04s)]
*  I would love to see you, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7429.68s)]
*  I feel like you have such a calling to be able to just, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7431.96s)]
*  I mean, you already doing it, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7434.48s)]
*  but your ability to communicate, man, is really strong. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7436.16s)]
*  And it's not, I didn't know, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7439.72s)]
*  I didn't have a super strong idea [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7441.24s)]
*  of what you would be like as a human [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7443.52s)]
*  outside of what I've seen of you or heard of you. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7445.200000000001s)]
*  I've done a pretty bad job, honestly, of just, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7447.320000000001s)]
*  I've kind of hidden. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7452.280000000001s)]
*  It's been a rough, like I'd say last five years, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7454.200000000001s)]
*  and I just, us being the way we are as addicts [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7457.96s)]
*  or whatever it is that we're saddled with or blessed with, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7465.400000000001s)]
*  however you want to look at that, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7468.88s)]
*  we isolate, you know what I mean? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7470.160000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7471.8s)]
*  And I get away from people and places and things [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7473.12s)]
*  or anything that could potentially cause more discomfort, [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7477.0s)]
*  you know, that gnawing, self-centered fear, [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7480.08s)]
*  that fear of nothing in particular is just like, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7483.280000000001s)]
*  if I go out there, I'm going to melt, you know, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7485.68s)]
*  like just baseless, but yeah. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7487.68s)]
*  And I got some good people I work with, Charlie, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7490.52s)]
*  it's also a brother of mine, my boy Boogie Jason, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7495.160000000001s)]
*  like just people that, some good people around me, man, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7497.72s)]
*  when not necessarily, some people left me, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7500.96s)]
*  a lot of people left, some were justified, some weren't. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7504.68s)]
*  But there were also a lot of people that I walked away from, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7508.68s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7512.4s)]
*  I withdrew from everything and everybody at a certain point, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7513.24s)]
*  and so the people that were still around me, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7516.96s)]
*  and they weren't, that's not something they signed up for, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7519.8s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, to be, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7522.68s)]
*  to have this responsibility of fucking like salvaging [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7524.44s)]
*  or trying to get, you know what I mean? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7527.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, we're confusing folks, man. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7529.5199999999995s)]

*  Damn, and it's sad, because I don't know sometimes [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7559.28s)]
*  if I could do that, if I'm real, I don't know [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7561.599999999999s)]
*  if I could love somebody that cares. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7564.04s)]
*  Oh, he didn't, I mean, trust me, he didn't want to. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7565.92s)]
*  Like, I think he, at certain times, you know what I'm saying, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7568.16s)]
*  like we done been into it, you know, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7571.5199999999995s)]
*  and, but he ain't perfect either, you know what I'm saying? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7573.2s)]
*  So it's like sometimes, sometimes the quote unquote [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7576.639999999999s)]
*  sick one can, you know, can, yeah. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7579.88s)]

*  I can only hear. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7594.0s)]
*  That sound like somebody that's bullshitting to me, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7595.16s)]
*  like, you know, a well person. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7597.16s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta hear from somebody that's sick. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7599.12s)]
*  We was talking about that last night, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7601.84s)]
*  we were talking about how, you know, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7603.2s)]
*  just that therapeutic value, you know, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7604.04s)]
*  of one act helping another, like, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7605.84s)]
*  when you know somebody's been through that shit, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7607.84s)]
*  you know, the same, you know, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7609.96s)]
*  and just attraction over promotion, you know, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7611.88s)]
*  we were just talking about all these [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7614.88s)]
*  different principles and concepts, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7616.24s)]
*  and yeah, I can, you know, God bless anybody [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7617.76s)]
*  that's coming from a good place and trying to help, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7622.5199999999995s)]
*  but I really can only be helped by somebody [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7625.5199999999995s)]
*  that can relate, you know, because I've just, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7628.44s)]
*  you know, we just feel like terminally unique, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7632.76s)]
*  was it terminally unique and fatally cool [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7636.4s)]
*  or something like that? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7638.8s)]
*  Like, basically like, I've always felt like not, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7639.639999999999s)]
*  they're just, I couldn't just relate to people [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7645.200000000001s)]
*  that just hadn't experienced, like, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7649.200000000001s)]
*  and we all experience pain, that's not what I'm saying, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7652.96s)]
*  but it's almost like somebody that's like, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7654.92s)]
*  would inflict pain on themselves like we do, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7657.72s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, it's like, you know. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7659.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a superstar with an inferiority complex, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7662.04s)]
*  something like that. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7665.12s)]
*  Well, I'm a people pleaser that don't give a fuck [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7665.96s)]
*  when nobody thinks about me. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7667.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7668.52s)]
*  That's the real deal, but you go maniac [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7669.360000000001s)]
*  with inferiority complex. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7671.96s)]
*  You go maniac with inferiority complex, man. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7673.0s)]
*  Just a crazy son of a bitch. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7675.6s)]
*  A lot of us are out there, man, [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7677.08s)]
*  and a lot of us don't even know that we have this, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7678.6s)]
*  that they have some element of it. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7680.92s)]
*  You know, my old sponsor, again, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7683.28s)]
*  used to say that he was, the people that pick up the drug [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7685.88s)]
*  or the drink or whatever, they're the blessed ones, [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7690.16s)]
*  because that gets us that much closer to the solution, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7692.8s)]
*  whether we pick it up or not, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7695.04s)]
*  but some people go through their whole lives [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7696.64s)]
*  and they never find the thing [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7698.8s)]
*  that brings everything to a head, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7700.84s)]
*  where they do identify the fact [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7703.0s)]
*  that they got some shit wrong with them, you know what I'm [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7704.12s)]
*  saying? [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7705.759999999999s)]
*  So they just go through their lives red, [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7706.599999999999s)]
*  restless, irritable, and discontent, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7707.879999999999s)]
*  and no idea why, you know what I'm saying? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7709.5599999999995s)]
*  God, that is almost like a hell. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7712.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I know some people very close to me. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7715.44s)]
*  I would say they fall into that category, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7719.48s)]
*  and there's just nothing, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7721.4s)]
*  and they'll talk at you all day about, [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7723.24s)]
*  you know what I mean, like, you know, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7725.679999999999s)]
*  you just gotta be strong and all this stuff, you know, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7727.599999999999s)]
*  but it's like, I'm just sitting there [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7729.839999999999s)]
*  and seeing the quote unquote disease manifest itself [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7732.36s)]
*  in that person's life, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7735.56s)]
*  and that's just not even a conversation they're willing, [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7737.08s)]
*  because they attach it to the drug, [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7739.8s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7741.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7742.8s)]
*  Well, really, that's just a symptom, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7743.62s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7745.400000000001s)]
*  It's the us problem, you know what I'm saying? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7746.24s)]
*  Oh, I never had an issue with drinking, man. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7748.4400000000005s)]
*  I never, I didn't like drinking. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7750.2s)]
*  I had to go pee, like we probably all do have to right now. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7752.2s)]
*  I had to go pee, bro, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7755.36s)]
*  and I hated having to go pee, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7757.04s)]
*  because I didn't want to miss being around people, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7758.52s)]
*  so I never liked drinking, man. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7760.8s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7762.56s)]
*  Now, I like something, I did start to like cocaine [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7763.400000000001s)]
*  because it, and drinking was, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7765.320000000001s)]
*  it took too long to feel some type of way. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7767.320000000001s)]
*  I wanted cocaine, it was like, you could feel this, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7769.400000000001s)]
*  you could feel this right now. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7771.4400000000005s)]
*  And that hangover's awful, though. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7772.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was horrible, but I never, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7773.84s)]
*  so it took me so long to realize [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7775.84s)]
*  that I had all these alcoholisms, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7777.64s)]
*  that I had all this restless, irritable, and this- [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7779.400000000001s)]
*  I, self, and me. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7781.96s)]
*  Yeah, it took, because there was no, like, [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7782.8s)]
*  it was so hard to pin the tail on the donkey, man. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7785.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7788.2s)]
*  Because you want to attach it [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7789.04s)]
*  to a certain substance or something, you know? [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7790.2s)]
*  Really, it's just, that's your solution for a while. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7792.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7795.8s)]
*  Whatever you pick up, that gambling, that food, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7796.64s)]
*  at first it's your solution, it quiets the beast, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7800.6s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7804.72s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't want to sit here with myself. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7805.56s)]
*  I don't want to sit in the fucking moment, bro, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7807.04s)]
*  because at some point in my life, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7809.64s)]
*  when I was a kid or a baby or whatever, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7811.08s)]
*  the moment wasn't, it wasn't good for me. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7813.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7816.08s)]
*  It was not a safe place to be, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7816.92s)]
*  so anything that keeps me, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7819.12s)]
*  because the moment can see you clearly. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7821.92s)]
*  The moment is a fucking mirror, you know? [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7823.88s)]
*  And I don't want to be right there, man, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7826.56s)]

*  I mean, we could go all day about it. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7829.96s)]
*  I literally just thought that made me break out in a sweat. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7831.52s)]
*  We could go all day about it, man. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7833.92s)]

*  So it's a blessing, man, Charlie. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7861.04s)]
*  You know, because that's another thing, too, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7862.96s)]
*  is just, you know, in your head, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7864.04s)]
*  you're like, I don't know about it. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7865.360000000001s)]
*  I got this thing where I think people, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7866.52s)]
*  at my shows, that people pay just because they hate me. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7868.360000000001s)]
*  Like, it's sickness, you know what I'm saying? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7871.6s)]
*  It's another sickness, so I don't think [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7874.64s)]
*  nobody gives a damn what I got to say, or nothing, you know? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7875.72s)]

*  But it's good to hear that, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7880.320000000001s)]
*  and it's good to hear you say all those kind of things. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7882.56s)]
*  Yeah, man, I just think because there's not, [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7885.280000000001s)]
*  there's no other you, man, like you said a minute ago. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7890.56s)]
*  There's, I mean, look, man, I was listening [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7894.8s)]
*  to some of your verses a couple days ago, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7896.64s)]
*  and it's like, nobody has whatever this is. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7898.400000000001s)]
*  Now, they have different versions of any shit, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7902.4800000000005s)]
*  and they got newer and older versions of it. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7905.12s)]
*  And they got some things I don't have. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7905.96s)]
*  Right, agreed. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7907.32s)]
*  Yeah, but I got some shit, I mean, you know. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7908.32s)]

*  I mean, you know, hey, I'm blessed, you know, [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7911.96s)]
*  and we all are, you know what I'm saying? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7914.759999999999s)]
*  Amen, bro. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7916.32s)]
*  That's the unique, that's the great thing [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7917.16s)]
*  about the way humans are set up, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7919.4s)]
*  where our accounts are set up, you know, is like, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7922.799999999999s)]
*  man, if you just, we all got some qualities, man, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7925.599999999999s)]
*  that can be redeemable, you know what I'm saying? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7928.16s)]
*  That can, we just gotta, you know, what we feed, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7930.839999999999s)]
*  we'll flourish, and what we starve, we'll die, you know? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7935.2s)]
*  In our own spirits. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7937.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, man, I gotta start feeding the good spots, man. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7939.16s)]
*  We all do, we all gotta, you know what I'm saying? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7943.32s)]
*  That's gotta be vigilant as far as that goes, [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7945.679999999999s)]
*  because I damn sure, I'll tell myself a fucked up story, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7947.96s)]
*  and let's say whatever story you're telling yourself [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7951.28s)]
*  is true, you know, so. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7953.5199999999995s)]
*  I know, and I get tired of living my old story, man. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7956.24s)]
*  That's what, you know, I get tired. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7959.44s)]
*  But somehow I start to realize, man, is this, you know, [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7960.76s)]
*  whether it was your story, or whether it was your truth, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7964.400000000001s)]
*  or not growing up, how long you wanna keep telling yourself [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7966.52s)]
*  that just because of what it makes you feel like today? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7970.0s)]
*  This is just who you are, this is just what it is, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7972.68s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7974.72s)]
*  That's the biggest cop out, you know, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7975.56s)]
*  and I'm very guilty of it, you know? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7978.16s)]
*  It's resignation almost, but it's like. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7980.360000000001s)]
*  But it's hard when it's giving you also the flint [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7982.92s)]
*  and the steel that sparked wherever you are. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7986.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7988.88s)]
*  And if I diminish any aspect of it, then it's all gone. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7989.72s)]
*  If I don't have my story, then who the fuck even am I? [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7994.96s)]
*  And it's kinda happened to me like that before, too. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7997.240000000001s)]
*  Like I'd rather die than, I'd rather keep going [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=7999.84s)]
*  way beyond the gates of insanity and hell [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8003.6s)]
*  than just sit there mundane and just like, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8006.12s)]
*  that ain't it, bro, like that's not, you know. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8009.08s)]
*  And like I said, sometimes maybe I didn't put in enough work, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8012.4800000000005s)]
*  you know what I'm saying, inside the, you know, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8016.4400000000005s)]
*  whatever, you know what I'm saying? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8018.8s)]
*  So I didn't ever reach that point where I could feel [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8020.84s)]
*  that peace and that freedom and still have my good shit. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8023.8s)]
*  And then it's an ongoing process even from there. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8027.6s)]
*  It's not like it just happens one day [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8029.4800000000005s)]
*  and you're just like, oh, I'm good now. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8031.4800000000005s)]
*  No, then it's an ongoing process, too. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8033.04s)]
*  And it's like, how much do I wanna take care of myself? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8035.400000000001s)]
*  Because there's a part of me that don't ever wanna [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8037.400000000001s)]
*  take care of myself because it ain't even [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8038.92s)]
*  my fucking job to do it. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8040.16s)]
*  And that's the part, too, inside of me sometimes. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8041.72s)]
*  That this is somebody else's job, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8044.88s)]
*  why do I have to do it every day? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8047.52s)]
*  You know, I still think like that sometimes. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8049.56s)]
*  Some of that shit's hard to kill, bro. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8051.6s)]
*  But I felt like I was in nine meetings today, man. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8054.8s)]
*  Sydney, Chadwick, Beverly Hills. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8057.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like that, too, man. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8059.120000000001s)]
*  And I've been in the program for five and a half, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8060.160000000001s)]
*  six years and I've only, I'm still, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8062.120000000001s)]
*  I just got to step nine two days ago. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8063.76s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8066.160000000001s)]
*  Well, see, you know, the particular fellowship I was in, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8067.280000000001s)]
*  like just the steps are work slower, you know what I'm saying? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8070.080000000001s)]
*  You know, with the workbook and stuff. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8074.360000000001s)]

*  you know, what the steps are actually trying to accomplish, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEcb9_gXuc&t=8097.68s)]
