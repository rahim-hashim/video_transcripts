*  Yeah, but you feel older I feel older yeah, I feel like I'm fucking a thousand years old sometimes [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=218.68s)]

*  Yeah, there's like I feel like there's a lot of different facets that that that people could learn about you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=243.52s)]
*  and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=248.52s)]
*  Like a bar like obviously you barb [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=250.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was a barber for years working in a barber shop in in New Jersey where you're in New York Staten Island [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=252.96s)]
*  So it's kind of like a little bit of Jersey of New York. Yeah exactly. Yeah exactly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=258.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the five boroughs, but it gets left out. It's left behind, and it kind of looks like New Jersey, so [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=262.8s)]
*  God dude always wanted to be from New Jersey man. Oh, yeah [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because it's kind of like New Orleans, but in the Northeast [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=271.8s)]
*  Yeah, and people talk a little bit the same sometimes like way yet kind of like mm-hmm [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=275.4s)]
*  Cuz you like people from New Orleans a lot of time their accent especially women kind of thicker women will get [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  Their accent will get mistaken for New Jersey. Just real lazy just lazy the way you pronounce your us. Yeah, you know well [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=286.32s)]
*  Yeah, no coffee or water the Holland yeah [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=294.0s)]
*  And it just seems as always so there's so many great movies kind of made about that area where you get to see [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=298.56s)]
*  like I think there's a lot of romanticizing it feels like coming up in that area like a lot of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=304.96s)]
*  Does it feel like that not for me no I wanted to get the hell out of there that the second I was old enough [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=313.28s)]
*  To leave I left at 18 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  I moved down to Miami Beach, and that's where the romanticizing started for me, but I was drunk all those years [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't remember any of it. Oh you drank a lot coming up heavily. Yeah, and I really like your stuff [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=325.2s)]
*  I like how you mix in the sobriety talk and you talk about your own stuff [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=329.96s)]
*  You're very vulnerable [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=334.14s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I you know when I got into this game [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=336.18s)]
*  I was like I'm just gonna fuck around and make funny videos [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I never thought to myself like I would be getting vulnerable [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=341.41999999999996s)]
*  I talked to your producer, and he said that he watched the documentary so he'd seen me cry already [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=344.86s)]
*  So it's odd for it to meet a man. That's a stranger. Yeah, and he had already seen me cry [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=349.7s)]
*  So I'm still getting used to stuff like that, but seeing you do it. It's cool [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=354.26s)]
*  You know it gives me hope like something to look forward to in the future. You know thanks, man [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=357.74s)]
*  Well, it's nice you to say that I mean I mean I think you seem like a really sincere guy [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=362.54s)]
*  Was it all were you always that way or is it are you finding now because it seems like here's what it seemed [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  Like to me when I watch your stuff that you've done kind of everything it seems like you're this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  This being you're almost like this attack barber. That's what I felt like a little bit not in a bad way [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=378.62s)]
*  But like in the barbershop shirt. Do you yes the podcast yeah, okay, but but I saw [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=384.58000000000004s)]

*  Also the one vlog to about this like your history your life that kind of like sums up [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=391.66s)]
*  It's just like a little bit of everything okay, so you got a really cute seeing your parents [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=395.5s)]
*  But you I'm just I was trying to piece together okay, who is this guy? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=400.62s)]
*  You know what is is it seemed like you've done everything or you wanted to do everything yeah? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=403.78000000000003s)]

*  Here's a question right here from somebody [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1194.18s)]
*  Hey, Jeff, I'm a huge fan [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1198.46s)]
*  My name is Mitch. I'm from New Zealand [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  I was just curious to know [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1204.3400000000001s)]
*  What do class is being successful? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1206.3400000000001s)]
*  Let me know gang gang gang baby damn, that's beautiful. Thank you very much Jeff [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1210.74s)]
*  New Zealand you want to take that one or should I you? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1216.02s)]
*  Man success, I think just maintaining a level of happiness is successful [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1220.5800000000002s)]
*  But I was in the boxing gym earlier [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1225.7s)]
*  I was doing sit-ups at the end of my workout [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1227.66s)]
*  And I looked up and there was like you know they have quotes all over these boxing gyms [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1229.5s)]
*  Yeah, it said I forget the fucking quote exactly, but it was like success is [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1232.9s)]
*  Consistent effort in [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1240.3400000000001s)]
*  Over a long period of time or something like that [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1242.3799999999999s)]
*  That's how you get I guess that's like getting results in like in like a combat sport or something like that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1245.98s)]
*  But I guess that can still translate over into everyday life. You know [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1250.4199999999998s)]
*  consistent effort over time yeah, and [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1255.1799999999998s)]
*  Like we do that with multiple things like the hardest part about podcasting is probably staying consistent [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1258.4199999999998s)]
*  Just getting in here getting it done. You know like getting doing your workouts. Just getting into the gym is the hardest part [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1263.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point going to work finishing the day without telling your boss to go fuck himself. You know yeah [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1269.58s)]
*  That's [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1276.62s)]
*  That was John Wooden's definition of success that became pretty famous [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1278.8999999999999s)]
*  Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of sass fat [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1283.54s)]
*  Self-satisfaction and knowing you made the effort to become the best you were capable of becoming [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1287.24s)]
*  I think that's I think that might be the quote [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1291.06s)]
*  I just butchered it so bad, but I wasn't planning on talking about it [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1293.22s)]
*  You know, I was like noted it a lot cuz your thing had three or four words, but that's okay mm-hmm [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1296.32s)]
*  Yeah, but do you feel like so I sometimes because sometimes when I wonder about you [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1304.56s)]
*  I wonder well [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  What is there a level of achievement or what is like a driving force because it's something I wonder about myself [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1310.8s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to get a blue check on Instagram, right? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  I was like I'll be good with that once I get that you know [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1319.6s)]
*  Maybe that gold plaque on her like the YouTube when you get a million subscribers like that would be like an accomplishment that I'd be [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1321.56s)]
*  Like okay, I made it right, but it never goes away. It's never gonna. Go away [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1328.1s)]
*  I don't think it ever will in you, too [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  You know where do you think it comes from and what do you think that is that thing? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1332.8999999999999s)]
*  Cuz that's what's kind of fascinating to me. Yeah, it's odd, huh like what are we chasing? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1336.84s)]
*  You know like what do you do you set a goal of money in your bank account that is gonna make you happy? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1341.12s)]
*  And then what money can't be it there's no way that money's it [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1346.0s)]
*  No, cuz then you just get all the money, and then you're like sitting around what the fuck do I do I guess? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1349.4799999999998s)]
*  I'll just get high on drugs. I'll just do fucking ketamine therapy like I'm not saying that's that's bad [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1353.3799999999999s)]
*  It might have worked for you, but like we just always have like I don't know [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1358.56s)]
*  I need to stay busy in order to not like fall into the stresses of everyday life [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1363.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know so money is not it because if I reach that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1368.12s)]
*  Goal, and then I don't have to work anymore than I don't know I don't see that as like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1372.6s)]
*  Success or happiness, I don't know I think you got to stay pushing for life like that like that whole thing like do a little [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1377.44s)]
*  bit of everything every day consistently if it's working out if it's [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1383.92s)]
*  Podcasts you're working on other shows or you have you do jiu-jitsu, right? Yeah, so you're building up in that you're just better than yourself [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1387.96s)]
*  And a bunch of different things each day [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1394.28s)]
*  Then if you have a shitty day jiu-jitsu, maybe you had a good podcast that day [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1397.72s)]
*  You know you got something productively right there you go. That's one. So that's one thing [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1401.5600000000002s)]
*  Doing something that makes you feel some sort of achievement [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1407.16s)]
*  Showing up like making my bed right when I get up is always a good one for me. It's like okay [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1410.5600000000002s)]
*  I started I have one thing done [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  You know even if even if that's the only thing I'll even get done today everything else [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1416.68s)]
*  I might fuddle through at least I started off with one thing right yeah [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  But sometimes it's interesting because I'll look at [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1425.28s)]
*  Like a family this morning. I went to the smoothie shop [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1429.28s)]
*  And there's a family out there [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1433.0400000000002s)]
*  And there's like something they're singing a song rain go away or something raining for a minute [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1434.64s)]
*  And they're like there was like this to a man or a husband or could have been a lesbian couple, but one of them was real [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1438.76s)]
*  Well, you know trying to be a man, and then they had two children [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1446.52s)]
*  They were having like a sweet time, and I was like oh, that's [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1450.2800000000002s)]
*  You know whatever I'm standing here with things bouncing in my head and worrying about this at that success [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1453.3600000000001s)]
*  Like I think sometimes you see it in little just having a significant other or having me [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1459.8s)]
*  I don't know it was like some piece of happiness that I witnessed for a minute these people didn't know that I was looking at [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  Them mm-hmm, so I don't know so no like it's like I [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1469.72s)]
*  Don't know I'm just trying to look at what the idea of success is you know maybe we got to have kids [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1474.36s)]
*  You got a dog or anything any I don't I got a stuffed animal abilities of other lives [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1479.72s)]

*  Well, I was like I think I was around like 28, and I'm like what the hell am I doing my life [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1870.4s)]
*  I'm kind of half-assed and everything. I'm half-assed and drug dealing. I'm half-assed and social media [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1875.36s)]
*  It's a kind of a weird career to merge [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1880.0s)]
*  It's like if I was a rapper and I sold crack before cool [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1882.32s)]
*  That's normal, but like if you're a youtuber that fucking sold drugs before it's a little weird to get people understand [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1885.46s)]
*  But right I could see that I guess if I just explained it like that like I'm like 50 cent of the fucking YouTube game [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1891.12s)]
*  You know right gang I should be dead, but I'm still here. Yeah, I sold drugs before I'm doing this shit now [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1896.04s)]

*  You know you got to collect money people don't want to fucking send you money if you're acting like a clown on the internet [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1914.4s)]
*  You know like who was this guy right? I'm not paying him crying in his videos on YouTube [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1918.76s)]

*  I've heard he's a really nice guy, and he's jacking if we want. I'm not gonna say he has a change [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1968.48s)]
*  But if we want HGH he's the guy to call I bet we could probably squeeze [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1973.04s)]
*  I believe it looks like he has the rocks tattoo over there. Oh, he might inspiration [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1977.4s)]
*  But back to what I was saying that guy's question, so I had to take it [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1981.96s)]
*  Serious you know you can't half-ass both things so I was like [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1986.08s)]
*  Waking up hungover, and then you have to get to filming and stuff like that [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1990.6s)]
*  You don't have your confidence that you had at the night before with your five asshole friends, and yet [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=1994.32s)]

*  But then it just it it levels out in the morning and you're fucking down and you're now it's time to entertain [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=2002.6s)]

*  You know okay? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=2037.08s)]

*  To that like having the confidence the night before if you've been drinking or out having fun with your buddies [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=2043.84s)]
*  But then suddenly [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=2048.56s)]

*  Like this in MMA is a good technique to start out the fight like push him away [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3506.56s)]
*  But also if you try that out on the street you might hit nuts and you might hit fucking and that's there's no timeouts [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3510.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so that's an effective way [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3516.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh to get to not engage in and to throw a shot [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3518.8399999999997s)]
*  But also like say like look you don't fucking want it. They might get hit in the nuts [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3523.3599999999997s)]

*  Yeah, I [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3536.04s)]
*  Wonder if you suck if you saw him in person you ever met Connor in person. No me neither [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3538.6s)]
*  But I wonder if you saw him in person if he looks because some fighters if they had on a hoodie [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3543.68s)]
*  Yeah, you may have no idea if it weren't for the ears, you know, yeah the ears. Um [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3549.64s)]
*  Yeah, what happened with Connor Connor and uh, Cormier got into it. Yeah [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3555.6s)]
*  Connors [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3559.88s)]
*  Took umbridge with some criticism that Daniel Cormier made on one of his MMA shows and he just started going off on [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3561.12s)]
*  Daniel Cormier is a fat mess [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3568.2s)]
*  Getting into worse condition by the day god bless. I mean he's retired [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3570.64s)]
*  You know showing up drunk at media events the very day before he was in the booth calling my fight [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3573.94s)]
*  Oh, he so he was upset at bias commentating [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3579.58s)]
*  So he was imagine if he had that fucking baseball commentator on his fight. Hey, I would love doing the Irish [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3584.2s)]
*  I can't help but do the Irish accent and I don't know if that's you know [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3590.16s)]
*  That's a great point if that would have been an Irish guy I bet there's no problem because I fuck I fucking love it [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3594.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's full fucking to be honest. I don't give a fuck. Oh fuck you mister [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3600.2599999999998s)]
*  It's a hard accent to do but it's just so fun [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3605.1s)]
*  I'd if I was commentating the fights if I was Daniel Cormier [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3607.62s)]
*  I'd be canceled big time because I would just do the whole fight in an Irish accent [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3610.06s)]
*  But I don't think you get in trouble for Irish accent. Would you think you get in trouble? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3614.34s)]
*  I mean if Connor's just pissed about him gaining weight [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3618.22s)]
*  On his own in his own life in his own time [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3622.18s)]
*  I think he's just gonna be pissed about everything that Cormier does and court look let's be honest [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3625.14s)]
*  You Cormier is that thick you know what I'm saying? He's built like go like Winnie the Pooh [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3630.74s)]
*  Went to frickin CrossFit for two years. Yeah, you know [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3636.38s)]
*  He's got that he has the body style you're talking that Babe Ruth body style where it's just he got all the body [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3639.94s)]
*  You got every part and you're still great at whatever your sport is [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3645.22s)]
*  Yeah, and and that's a perfect example because it's MMA where you have to you know make weight, but he's a heavyweight [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3649.22s)]
*  So yeah, you could be 265 you get up there, but now you got guys like Inganu that are now using every [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3655.06s)]

*  Cubic square of fucking muscle on your body has to be like lean muscle [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3663.5s)]
*  You know Ingan was a fucking specimen man that guy is terrifying [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3667.7s)]
*  You see the picture of him next to the the smallest heavyweight champ like the the heavyweight champ next to the lightweight flyweight [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3671.62s)]
*  draw weight, I don't know all the weights is too many. I'm like a [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3677.9s)]
*  Mine would be just wait dude. I need a few minutes for I go in the ring. That's my way look at this [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3683.1s)]

*  He'll hit it and then go again. Yeah, he might just punch through it [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3728.46s)]
*  I went to the UFC PI in Vegas and they have that thing where you you punch and it tells you like how much you're [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3731.42s)]

*  And then I was getting canceled just for promoting their merch [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3833.08s)]
*  So I mean it's just what you give a fuck that is their value and getting canceled these days like my friend Morgan Wallin [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3836.8s)]
*  He has like he got canceled or whatever and he's like the biggest musician in the world the n-word situation yeah, yeah [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3843.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean he's a big now. He's I think he's a big I mean he's basically like the [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3852.96s)]
*  Case like the male Katy Perry now yeah. Oh, yeah [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3857.12s)]
*  I mean you're saying that he'll be on tour for ten years if he wants to I think anyway [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3860.72s)]
*  So that actually helped his career it definitely didn't hurt him [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3865.2799999999997s)]
*  I think the way that they beat the media beat him down about it. Yeah, just helped him [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3868.8399999999997s)]
*  It's almost like if you want to sell a good tour [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3872.76s)]
*  Get canceled first not that Morgan couldn't have without it, but I bet I'll just [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3875.5600000000004s)]
*  Kind of did now he did a little bit of like the song and dance you know that they make you do yeah for sure [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3881.0800000000004s)]
*  Well he grew up in the south yeah, you know did he get a pass from somebody? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3886.44s)]
*  Cuz I don't know if I don't know that doesn't count, but no, but it kind of I mean look he called it like [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3891.6400000000003s)]
*  He called his friend his white friend a pussy ass n-word yeah, you know yeah [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3897.04s)]
*  And he didn't say er he said a yeah, which you can buy in music [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3904.4s)]
*  So to me I to me and a lot of my black friends didn't even think it was a big deal [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3907.7599999999998s)]
*  You know it's really just the media, but if you can get the media to bite into yeah something controversial [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3911.68s)]
*  I wonder do you think it can help your vibe these days? Yeah? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3917.64s)]
*  Yeah, I [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3922.16s)]
*  Mean if if that's part of your brand, and you just double down on it [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3923.68s)]
*  You don't apologize you just say this is who I am and I made a mistake times are changing [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3927.22s)]
*  You know I don't know this is fucking nice probably shouldn't comment on this stuff. Oh, I don't know I think it's interesting [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3931.66s)]
*  Yeah [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3937.7599999999998s)]
*  But I just feel like it's cancel culture now something people can use as leverage to be a better [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3939.3199999999997s)]
*  To promote it's almost like like six nine did if you watch that documentary about six nine [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3945.52s)]
*  His whole thing was like six nine is a documentary bro, and it's yeah, and it's fascinating bro his whole thing was to me [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3950.7s)]
*  I'm gonna tell these rapper rappers are not tough anymore [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3959.46s)]
*  Mm-hmm the guys who were shooting each other they both shot each other biggie shot to pop to pock shot biggie [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3963.34s)]
*  Yeah, they shoot at the same time how that even happened [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3968.14s)]
*  Uh-huh, and here's what it was like a month apart or something right? Oh one of us are shot straight up in here then do [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3970.94s)]
*  but a [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3977.2599999999998s)]
*  But here's the thing he realized you like none of these dudes all of them are just about like internet cloud anymore [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3980.62s)]
*  There's no real killer. Yeah, I'm gonna call all of them pussies [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3985.34s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what he started doing and he's right none of them are gonna kill [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3989.58s)]
*  They all just want to have there [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3993.7s)]
*  It's more dangerous to be a youtuber because now you'll be like called out to box and okay now you got to actually fight [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=3995.34s)]
*  You know so you gotta be more hardcore to be a fucking youtuber now than a rapper. I was talking to it [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4000.5s)]
*  Oh, that's so true. I was so [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4006.34s)]
*  Yo, Gotti the other day, and he was like what's the deal with all these? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4009.42s)]
*  Youtubers boxers and money in that and I was like well back in the day when rappers had beef [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4013.42s)]
*  they would just shoot each other now like youtubers in our world they found a way to [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4017.98s)]
*  resolve that conflict and also monetize it and [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4023.62s)]
*  You know like some people get into boxing they love it like the Paul brothers [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4027.5s)]
*  They actually live and breathe boxing now [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4030.8799999999997s)]
*  yeah, move their trainers into their houses like they are putting millions into their training camps and [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4033.46s)]
*  There you know they have resources that are better than most fighters have you know a lot of these fighters again paid two [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4038.66s)]
*  Grand a fight if that you know how do you pay for training? They're like grateful just to get in a gym. Yeah [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4044.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just fascinating. Yeah, why aren't these rappers like if they have any real beef? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4051.34s)]
*  It's like the rappers have turned into [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4056.3s)]
*  The actors yeah, and the youtubers are the fucking ones that are actually about it. Let's settle the beef [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4059.66s)]
*  Yeah, look at us. We're in combat sports training what then what the fuck yeah, what are we preparing for I? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4066.1s)]
*  Don't know I would be willing to fight someone in a couple years. Oh, yeah, I think you do it somebody like around [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4073.42s)]
*  I think if Brendan Schaub lost it [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4078.82s)]
*  He's a you know Brendan Schaub and I do a show called King in the Sting and he formerly did UFC [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4080.98s)]
*  But if you lose a heavyweight though you'd go after him. I'd have to gain 40 to have to lose 40. Oh [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4085.58s)]
*  so he would be fucking a [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4090.66s)]
*  Toothpick and you would bulk up like [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4092.8599999999997s)]
*  Cormier probably yeah, I [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4094.8999999999996s)]
*  Don't know I'd probably go after somebody with a little less experience because he actually has octagon experience [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4097.38s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. Maybe Bobby Lee he wrestled in high school. It Bobby Lee's a perfect matchup [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4102.26s)]
*  It'd be good shit talk back and forth on stage [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4106.46s)]
*  You know press conference you get up there you fucking do the accent like that you get canceled your career blows up [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4108.86s)]
*  And then you fucking beat his ass. Yeah, dude [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4115.139999999999s)]
*  Actually beat him up I think I'd hate to didn't he say yes some more short experience [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4119.74s)]
*  Or is that just me stare? He does but I bet it's deep into his bone marrow now [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4124.54s)]
*  I mean it is he put up he's more than it's embedded in his brain. It's his instinct now [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4128.759999999999s)]
*  It's actually more dangerous that it's instinctual because he could just you know [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4133.259999999999s)]
*  Rekindle that that's a good point and his body parts aren't far apart [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4137.42s)]
*  So I feel like he can like manage his body [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4142.219999999999s)]
*  You know like some remote controls like the original PlayStation controller like that was just a couple buttons and it was close and easy [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4145.14s)]
*  And then you got that Xbox thing you're like what do any do it? Yes? I think I have too many [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4150.5s)]
*  Whereas he's just like you know yeah, it's more straight punches down the middle. That's all you need one, too [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4156.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's all you need to know a lot of people don't know Bobby wrestled at Poway [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4161.64s)]
*  What's the Poway High School? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4166.78s)]
*  This guy has a question about an opponent for each one of you is this dope as Yola [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4168.5s)]
*  It looks like a but I don't think it is [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4172.66s)]
*  So Brad King Jeff, how we doing? It's your boy meter from Jersey [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4177.46s)]
*  Theo's a big DP fan [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4184.18s)]
*  That's important. Not the other thing and Jeff likes Connor. I mean would you guys ever you know get in the ring? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4186.58s)]
*  Fucking ratting me right out over here. I mean I'm I think I think [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4193.26s)]
*  Think Theo would sleep Jeff in like 30 seconds. Hey, don't drive us against each other, bro [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4198.38s)]
*  We just met we're fucking finally warming up to each other [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4203.360000000001s)]
*  And you want to drive us against each other any fucking ratted me out of being a Connor fan. Yeah [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4206.200000000001s)]
*  You know I look I don't like Connors actions recently calling Cormier fat fuck is kind of a little funny [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4210.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know like yeah, he's he's got a work on his respect levels right now, but also he's going through some serious shit [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4217.360000000001s)]
*  He's got a life-changing injury right now when I was [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4224.54s)]
*  Smashed my fucking head off the crane. I was saying all types of bad shit crazy stuff. I still am today [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4228.3s)]
*  I probably said things on the podcast [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4233.38s)]
*  Yeah, well at least you could use a crane injury if he was like why do you say that be like just show a picture of [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4235.38s)]
*  A frickin big John Deere, you know [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4240.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you're done. You can say whatever you want. Yeah, you can only handicap blame it on the crane dude blame it on the crane [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4243.820000000001s)]
*  I made a song about it, too. You did yeah at the end of the documentary. You'll see it [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4251.22s)]
*  So yeah, I skydive into a musical performance at the end. I couldn't figure out how to end it [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4255.5s)]
*  I was like this is some sad shit [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4259.5s)]
*  It got real dark and then I just wanted to end it on a happy note. So I covered higher from Creed. Oh [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4261.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was a fucking jumped out of the judge jumped out of a hot air balloon [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4267.34s)]
*  And then I just started singing there's like a like because I can't sing I'm not a musician [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4271.3s)]
*  But I could do like funny singing voices [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4275.78s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4277.82s)]
*  So I did that and then I reached out to him and he like gave me the rights to do it or whatever [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4278.54s)]
*  Really? Yeah, that's awesome. Have you ever done the one that Josh Adam Myers does at the comedy at the [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4284.9s)]
*  Jam jam [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4292.38s)]
*  He has comedians and entertainers come on stage and sing with a live band like you you you goddamn comedy jam goddamn comedy [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4296.42s)]
*  Damn, I don't know if I could do that. I could do it for like I sold my own tour [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4303.62s)]
*  I could do it for my own fans [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4307.98s)]
*  But going out there for people that don't know me and then I just started doing a shitty cover of Creed [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4309.3s)]
*  I did it. It was bad. Everybody did it like open mics. I know that route. No, no, it's not open mic [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4312.8s)]
*  It's like a real show. So they've just the crowd is there just they know it's comedians and entertainers [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4318.72s)]
*  comedians performing [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4323.52s)]
*  Music that are not singers so they know [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4325.24s)]
*  But it's a real band and it's like a good people are just having fun [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4327.56s)]
*  But people like the average person has way more musical talent than I do really? Yeah, I don't have any [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4330.88s)]
*  Have like like bad what skills do you think you actually have? Like what are some of your honestly? What are your skills? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4336.08s)]
*  Fighting I could probably fucking take off the average youtubers head in a boxing match, you know [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4342.24s)]
*  Have you thought about challenging anybody? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4348.6s)]
*  Yeah, I've been doing it on my own podcast people are sick of it there [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4351.04s)]
*  I just call somebody out every week and nobody's taking the bait right now. What about Ethan Klein? Oh, yeah [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4354.8s)]
*  I mean he wouldn't take the bait. I mean what's in it for him money. Yeah, you know that how much money can you possibly give him? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4360.68s)]
*  He's not gonna do it. He wouldn't do it. I would love that matchup because he's fucking [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4366.76s)]
*  You know said some things about me, but you know, he's a heavyweight [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4371.0s)]
*  He would probably like to do a debate like a mental battle. What about Trisha Pattaya? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4375.08s)]
*  I mean that's man a woman that'd be a new thing. You'd have to be a new lady. I thought she was transgender [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht9vmAZrdVA&t=4379.16s)]
