*  they've seen us on our thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=254.64s)]
*  Like, oh my God, I love biodome. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=255.64s)]
*  I love the squirrely rat, whatever your fucking shit is on the stage. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=256.88s)]
*  The bad pigeon, yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=260.52s)]
*  The bad pigeon, you know what I mean? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=261.52s)]
*  But then after that, you're a human being and you're a person with a brain, a heart, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=262.88s)]
*  a smile, all that shit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=266.68s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you don't know if they're liking you for the rat. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=268.36s)]
*  Let me see the rat tail. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=271.92s)]

*  I'll pull this out on Easter sometimes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=277.4s)]
*  And I've actually, we did just, I'm thinking about getting like a half inch extension on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=278.4s)]
*  this part. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=282.08s)]
*  It's very Bon Jovi back in 1987, dude. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=283.08s)]
*  It's very, it's very. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  First song I ever listened to was Bon Jovi. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=288.12s)]

*  It's a it's kind of a dangerous [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2098.14s)]
*  It's a dice roll doing comedy because you're really you're at a because comedy club is just a bar attached to a stage [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2100.14s)]
*  That's all it is. It's a bar. So it's like you have access to everything [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2106.06s)]
*  Yeah, and you have access to everything and you perform at night. So you're at work at night [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2109.98s)]
*  People have just gotten out of a crowd. They're on a high you're on a high. It's like [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2113.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you're just there's so much temptation that's right there so much possibility for um [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2118.62s)]
*  To get in trouble. So how's so how's it going for you now? How are you feeling these days? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2123.98s)]
*  Um, I feel okay. I think I feel like a lot of responsibility sometimes, you know, so that's [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2128.2999999999997s)]
*  it's not as much fun sometimes I guess because you have a little you feel like you have more responsibility, but [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2133.18s)]
*  um, but then sometimes I gotta remember hey man, just take it easy just do your best be yourself try your best, uh, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2137.58s)]
*  And just try to be honest about you know, whenever you can about what's going on, you know, um [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2144.7799999999997s)]
*  So some of that's been pretty interesting. I think just that the boom we're having in comedy has been really [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2150.7799999999997s)]
*  That's been a real blessing because I think the news kind of shot itself in the dick over the past five years or something kind of like [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2156.2999999999997s)]
*  Nobody knows what's news or what's real anymore. So everything's such a joke anyway [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2164.54s)]
*  That I think people are like well at least I know these are jokes [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2169.02s)]
*  Yeah, and then what do you think about like doing something on stage or doing something or this or whatever? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2172.54s)]
*  And then people comment on this as opposed to the old days where you just do a tv show and no one would comment [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2179.1800000000003s)]
*  Right except for they would just come up to you at like a you know a diner and say oh I saw you on married [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2184.62s)]
*  With children or some shit. Yeah, but like this is instant. Do you read the comments? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2189.26s)]
*  Sometimes I'll look at some of them. Sometimes the producers will send me some to watch. Yeah, you know, it's good luck [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2193.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like do you want to open a box? It's that's [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2198.7000000000003s)]
*  Something can hurt your feelings. I don't know. You know, yeah, I think that's kind of some of the dangerous part [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2201.2599999999998s)]
*  Now if it's something super funny a lot of times they'll make sure that I see it, you know [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2205.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes if somebody makes funny really good think about what happened to jack black and his partner recently [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2209.1s)]
*  He's not his partner, you know, well, no because he said he homosexual the what he's homosexual [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2214.62s)]
*  No, I don't know. No, what happened was I think they said something about donald trump [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2220.54s)]
*  Oh, I didn't see it. Oh with tristan d or whatever the guy's name is snake d or whatever [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2224.54s)]
*  No, the his partner said something. Oh, yeah. He said I wish I wouldn't have missed him. Yeah [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2228.54s)]
*  I think that's fucking kind of classless. I think yeah, I wouldn't say that about a president. No [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2233.1s)]
*  Did you um, but isn't it wild that like you can? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2239.02s)]
*  Ad-lib something like that and then it's a rap for a while. Yeah, it's crazy, right? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2242.38s)]
*  And yes, it was terrible, you know that he said that and that's you don't you don't say that and you don't even joke about that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2246.7799999999997s)]
*  But I mean look, but also it's like that's how he feels [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2253.58s)]
*  uh [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2257.66s)]
*  I just think it's a kind of a [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2259.18s)]
*  And it had just had like yeah, it's just kind of people don't want that people are confused [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2261.66s)]
*  So what do you think about kamala these days? This is pretty [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2266.2999999999997s)]
*  It's it's gonna be no, but the whole thing not even she I know [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2270.06s)]
*  But the whole thing's gonna be like a great it's gonna be political theater. I think oh it is gonna be like [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2273.74s)]
*  It's all it is now. Yes, I think politics is just political theater. It's a shell or it's a shell company for [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2279.5s)]
*  the big [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2286.7s)]

*  Well, I think [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2295.1s)]
*  I don't know if kamala doesn't have it to win. I don't think that I don't think anyone is going to be trump [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2296.62s)]
*  To be honest. I like I think bobby kennedy. I feel like has a lot of great points to talk about himself [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2301.8199999999997s)]

*  You know you believe that he wants to get in there and do something different [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2310.7799999999997s)]
*  Why is it so many people don't want to run for president like the rock for instance people have talked about the rock [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2314.78s)]
*  Like he's gorgeous. He's big. He's handsome [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2320.94s)]
*  He's a huge huge star like you know like I think trump fans and then also the liberal [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2324.1800000000003s)]

*  I've been around like my mom for instance my mom wasn't well [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2456.02s)]
*  You know towards towards you know the last good ten years. She was you know have some dementia [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2459.98s)]
*  Yes, she had that whole thing so I was that was affecting me watching Joe or reminding me of my mom and your grandparents [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2465.2599999999998s)]
*  Or people's watching grandparents. It's not fucking funny. Oh if you did yeah, I mean my father was uh [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2472.94s)]
*  My father was 70 when I was born so he was an old man [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2478.1s)]
*  So I can totally relate to the sense of like it felt like somebody's being taken advantage of a little bit [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2481.02s)]
*  That's what and that really I don't care what side of you things you're on but that to me just felt [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2485.54s)]
*  It must look cringe to people in the world if that's how we're willing to do with our senior citizens [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2490.46s)]
*  And then also like every time he walked off a plane [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2495.02s)]
*  Wasn't cool like it felt like he was gonna fall yeah, it wasn't cool [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2498.06s)]
*  And it's like you know I didn't want to see that right you know what I mean [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2501.66s)]
*  I didn't want to see I don't I'm glad that didn't nothing bad happened [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2504.7s)]
*  That's a good point on all those little stages they put them on the scariest thing to put the scariest thing for senior citizen next to [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2507.58s)]
*  More than more than one ottoman in a room is a little stage dude because there's nowhere really to go [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2513.22s)]
*  Except for down yeah, just stairs [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2520.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, one stair two stairs. Yeah [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2522.74s)]
*  So yeah, so that shit was bone dude. What do you think I and it looks like almost they tried to kill Trump someone did [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2525.58s)]
*  It didn't work and so then Biden they're like well if that doesn't work then Biden has to step down [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2531.98s)]
*  So if you give put somebody they can try to win I don't that's true, but it looks a little bit like that [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2536.94s)]
*  What do you think happened? Do you think what do you think I think there's who's a little? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2542.42s)]

*  Would you still try to do it like I don't know if that's? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2912.86s)]

*  Being in this process that if you're a public figure. It's called an unauthorized biopic [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2931.06s)]
*  So for instance they happen every day [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2937.18s)]
*  So I mean the Pam and Tommy Hulu special or Hulu dot or Hulu series was unauthorized [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2939.58s)]
*  Oh wow you know they didn't ask make it that's they do stuff all the time that way so as [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2945.94s)]
*  Long as you don't don't do something mean you know as long as I do it nice like this piece [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2952.66s)]

*  So I'm moving forward with it [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2977.38s)]
*  And then but my instinct is like your instinct is get his estate to kind of be involved [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=2978.6600000000003s)]

*  So I wonder if that's happening here in Hollywood and now we have some numbers to back it up [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4160.46s)]
*  Film LA has just released their report on on location and stage based production data [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4165.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's take a look at what this means [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4172.8s)]
*  Production in LA is down way way way down from just last year [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4176.0s)]
*  Feature films are down 3% 3.3 percent [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4183.36s)]
*  Versus a five-year average as we know things were bad already. It is twenty three point eight percent down commercials are even worse over five-year average [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4186.679999999999s)]
*  36.1 percent down television is down [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4193.68s)]
*  45.8 percent and whatever other is is down 20 percent. So like industrial film short film. It's just everything [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4196.32s)]
*  Reality TV looks insane. The purple line here is reality. There's kovat. There's the strike [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4202.24s)]
*  There's where reality TV is in LA right now [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4208.8s)]
*  So as you can see just across the board everything is down all in all versus a five-year average [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4211.78s)]
*  Production shoot days in Los Angeles, California [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4217.56s)]

*  Unemployment rates in the motion picture and television industry now [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4227.240000000001s)]
*  They do lump the sound recording industries in with this but as you can see it's not good. That is a sixteen point one percent [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4229.900000000001s)]
*  Unemployment rate in the motion picture and television industry [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4236.88s)]
*  Yeah, but June so that is not counting the massive layoffs that just occurred again at Warner Brothers Discovery [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4239.92s)]
*  And it's definitely not counting. Okay, that's good. Yeah, but so I mean, they're just interesting and I'm not saying all this is like exactly [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4245.08s)]
*  But I've just I saw this the other day and I was like, wow [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4251.48s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if there's just not as many people here as well. Well, it's also the business has shifted [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Fgr91CamI&t=4253.6s)]
