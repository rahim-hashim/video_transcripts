*  He's kind of a revolutionary in a way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=102.0s)]
*  He's kind of a dang Paul Revere for a lot of people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=104.0s)]

*  Today's guest is Dave Portnoy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=117.0s)]
*  I love his style. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=132.0s)]
*  We hired, I mean, I hired a guy strictly because he's really blind. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=149.0s)]
*  But it was like, yeah, it was like in the, like he interviewed, it was a, it was a wallpaper. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=152.0s)]
*  I mean, he was so boring. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=158.0s)]
*  But he knew me. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=160.0s)]
*  He's like, I have one thing that may sway you like in my favor. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=161.0s)]
*  It's like what? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=164.0s)]
*  He's like, well, I'm legally blind. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=165.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, like, can I make fun of you for it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=166.0s)]
*  Like, is it open game? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=168.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=169.0s)]
*  So we hired him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=170.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=171.0s)]
*  He's still like, he's still with us in a way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=172.0s)]
*  Like to the point we thought he was faking it because like he knew that would get me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=176.0s)]
*  So one day we just, and a bunch of people thought he was faking it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=180.0s)]
*  So we called him up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=185.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just going to toss my wallet to him and see if he reacts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=186.0s)]
*  Smacked him right in the face. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=189.0s)]
*  The only time I felt bad. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=190.0s)]
*  So he was literally, literally blind, but he'd sit at his computer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=192.0s)]
*  Like what you were saying with this huge magnifying glass, you tell him to do something. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=196.0s)]
*  It took him four hours. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=201.0s)]
*  It was kind of a gimmick, but not the most productive guy to ever come down the street. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=206.0s)]
*  We, we interviewed a blind woman one time and it was pretty fascinating. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=207.0s)]
*  She said she remembered like the E like she almost feels like a computer sometimes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=211.0s)]
*  Like how like she would remember the way she would walk to school and stuff like that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=215.0s)]
*  So she lost her sight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=220.0s)]
*  She had some sight when she was young and it wasn't a lot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=221.0s)]
*  And then she lost it completely. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=223.0s)]
*  And so then she had to like, she said she started to feel like a computer and the only animals she didn't like, she said was a snake. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=225.0s)]
*  She said a snake doesn't give any feedback. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=231.0s)]
*  She's like, it just feels like just like a piece of Satan, I guess. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=233.0s)]
*  Maybe I was born to be blind. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=237.0s)]
*  I don't like snakes either. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=239.0s)]
*  That's the age old question. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=240.0s)]
*  Like, would you rather, would you rather like, if you were blind, would you rather have been able to see or never been able to see? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=241.0s)]
*  I think I would like to, if I'm going to be blind, I'm going all in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=250.0s)]
*  I'm saying never see. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=253.0s)]
*  Right. Because then you don't know what you're missing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=254.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then you can yell stuff. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=256.0s)]
*  You could use like, I don't want to say slurs, but you could probably say things that are other people are going to be like, oh, he shouldn't say anything like, oh, he's blind, you know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=258.0s)]
*  He's blind. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=266.0s)]
*  Dave Portnoy, thanks for coming in, man. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=267.0s)]
*  We don't know each other that great. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=270.0s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=273.0s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=274.0s)]
*  I feel like maybe we're... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=275.0s)]
*  I just met recently, really, for the first time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=277.0s)]
*  I forget. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=279.0s)]
*  Was it the U.S.? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=280.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=281.0s)]
*  When was the first time we met? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=282.0s)]
*  Was it at the LSU tailgate, I think. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=286.0s)]
*  And then we saw each other a couple of times after that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=289.0s)]
*  We're kind of like just sort of getting to know each other. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=290.0s)]
*  And you grew up in New York. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=294.0s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=297.0s)]
*  See, we don't know each other that well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=298.0s)]
*  Boston. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=299.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=300.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=301.0s)]
*  But does Boston always have such a chip on their shoulder about New York? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=302.0s)]
*  It's almost like, it almost seems like there's more like, it seemed like New York, but with more like kind of spousal abuse kind of a little bit low key, you know? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=314.0s)]
*  I'd have to look up the stats on that one. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=315.0s)]
*  There's definitely animosity. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=318.0s)]
*  I don't know if it stems from like spousal abuse, but it's the, you know, New York. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=319.0s)]
*  So I grew up in Boston and everybody in New York is always like Boston is a little town. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=329.0s)]
*  Basically it's not a city, it's a town. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=330.0s)]
*  You know, as a Boston guy, you kind of take offense to that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=331.0s)]
*  Then we moved to New York, and New York, it is compared to Boston. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=333.0s)]
*  It's a small little city, but it's so close to the sports rivalry. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=336.0s)]
*  Reminds me, I was in Milwaukee, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=339.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to go to the U.S. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=342.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, the Racine Bells from League of their own. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=344.0s)]
*  I was actually, I didn't realize it until after and I was mad. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=347.0s)]
*  I didn't know that I would have worked it in, but Racine people were very upset that I was calling it Milwaukee. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=349.0s)]
*  Like you're in Racine, you're not Milwaukee. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=354.0s)]
*  It's kind of that vibe, Boston, you know? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=356.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=358.0s)]
*  Like the underdog. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=359.0s)]
*  When you were growing up, what kind of like school did you go to? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=360.0s)]
*  Like, what was it like when you were growing up? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=362.0s)]
*  Like traditional, I was middle-class when I was in high school. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=364.0s)]
*  I was in the middle school. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=367.0s)]
*  I was in the middle school. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=368.0s)]
*  I was in the middle school. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=369.0s)]
*  I was in the middle school. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=370.0s)]
*  What was it like growing up? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=371.0s)]
*  Like traditional, I was middle-class, went to all public. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=372.0s)]
*  Like Swampscott, just the town I grew up was called Swampscott. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=375.0s)]
*  So I just went to the normal high school, normal middle school, normal everything. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=379.0s)]
*  Like my friends that I grew up with are still like really my best friends. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=382.0s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=386.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=387.0s)]
*  And what was it like at your house? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=388.0s)]
*  Like was your dad pretty cool or what was he like? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=389.0s)]
*  No, he's definitely, I went to, cool is not the word I would ever describe my dad as. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=391.0s)]
*  He's like, my parents are like the Seinfelds. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=398.0s)]
*  That's a better way to like Morty, you know, Morty. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=401.0s)]
*  And he takes, by the way, great offense to that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=404.0s)]
*  Oh, he loves it? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=406.0s)]
*  No, no, he, if you're like, you're like Morty Seinfeld, when Morty Seinfeld does something weird on site, he's like, no, I'm not. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=407.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=412.0s)]
*  But he is exactly like them. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=413.0s)]
*  They're kind of maybe the traditional, like overprotective, like Jewish, like family parents kind of. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=415.0s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=422.0s)]
*  Is it fun? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=423.0s)]
*  So you've been Jewish your whole life. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=424.0s)]
*  I mean, you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=426.0s)]
*  Is it fun being Jewish? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=427.0s)]
*  Like, what is it like? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=428.0s)]
*  Like. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=429.0s)]
*  No, I won't say it's fun. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=430.0s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=431.0s)]
*  Like I wasn't overly religious. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=432.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=434.0s)]
*  So, but no, I wouldn't say it's fun. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=435.0s)]
*  You got to battle, you know, I, I, I like Jews, you know, there's more, everyone celebrates Christmas. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=437.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=444.0s)]
*  Far fewer do Hanukkah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=445.0s)]
*  So like in the early days of Barstool, we had this guy, Kevin Clancy gets the big ass tree, you know, it's like, well, if we're going to do a big ass tree, I'm going to get a big ass menorah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=446.0s)]
*  We had the biggest menorah like ever made. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=455.0s)]
*  It had to be like put together in the office just so we weren't getting like short shifted on it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=456.0s)]
*  But yeah, no, I don't, I don't really give a fuck. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=461.0s)]
*  I'm not overly religious. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=464.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'll stick up for Jews if we're getting like, if Kanye is like, you know, Hitler wasn't that bad of a dude. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=466.0s)]
*  I'll be able to hold on there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=473.0s)]
*  Like he kind of was like, I don't know. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=474.0s)]
*  Like, well, he did rail. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=476.0s)]
*  He did the highway system. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=479.0s)]
*  You used it wrong. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=481.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=482.0s)]
*  Also, I think so. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=484.0s)]
*  I don't know how many Jews are there, but it's like, there's a lot of them, so they're really nice. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=485.0s)]
*  They're really nice. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=489.0s)]
*  They're a lot of them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=490.0s)]
*  They're really nice to us, too. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=491.0s)]
*  So I don't know that one plus one equals two, whatever. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=492.0s)]
*  So, but I'm not not overly, but like shit like that, I will get involved like when people are defending him, it's like the guys out here, like basically pro Hitler. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=495.0s)]
*  How can anyone defend them? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=505.0s)]
*  So that shit I'll speak up on. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=506.0s)]
*  Half of my closest friends are Jewish, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=508.0s)]
*  especially once you get to like LA or New York, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=510.2s)]
*  you meet a lot more Jewish people. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=512.08s)]
*  They didn't have like a lot of Jewish people [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=513.32s)]
*  when I was growing up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=514.6s)]
*  So- [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=515.8s)]
*  We're running the media. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=516.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=517.92s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=518.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's so many Jewish people [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=521.2s)]
*  that work in the media. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=523.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=525.4s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=526.24s)]
*  It's like, I don't know who's, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=527.96s)]
*  I don't know who's if somebody's really running something. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=530.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=532.8s)]
*  No, well, I mean, it's like anything. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=533.64s)]
*  You can look, I run Barstool Sports. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=534.68s)]
*  That's a media company. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=536.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=537.38s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=538.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=539.06s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=539.9s)]
*  I mean, I'd rather not look my ass for it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, whatever. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=542.38s)]
*  Listen, there's bad people or scumbags in every race, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=543.2199999999999s)]
*  religion, creed, whatever. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=547.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  Jews get a bad rap, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=549.92s)]
*  but a lot of people get bad rap. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=550.76s)]
*  So what do you know? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=552.54s)]
*  Yeah, I was just wondering what is it like? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=553.38s)]
*  Like does it feel, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=554.92s)]
*  I wonder if it feels different being Jewish. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=555.76s)]
*  Does it feel like- [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=557.5s)]
*  Like do I wake up? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=559.14s)]
*  I'm like, damn, I'm a Jew? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=560.3s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  Or like, yeah, I guess, I don't know. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=562.66s)]
*  I guess I don't even know what I'm asking. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=564.66s)]
*  Which I've always said. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=566.06s)]
*  So- [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=567.42s)]
*  Because Jewish people are very determined. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=568.38s)]
*  Jewish people like to create value in things. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=569.6199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it's kind of like a family thing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=571.6199999999999s)]
*  Like they're very, very education, very hardworking [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  and put a premium on that and then it shows. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=577.18s)]
*  But the thing about being Jewish, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=580.26s)]
*  which I have always pointed out, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=581.7399999999999s)]
*  we're getting deep, but it's like, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=583.5s)]
*  people say, you'll hear this a lot. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=584.8199999999999s)]
*  Like, what are you? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=586.38s)]
*  And someone will be like, I'm Italian. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=587.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm fucking, you know, Russian. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm Jewish. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=590.5s)]
*  But Jewish, like if I wanted to change [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=591.9799999999999s)]
*  being Jewish tomorrow, I could. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=593.6199999999999s)]
*  It's not like a blood thing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  Jewish is a religion that you choose. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=596.3s)]
*  If someone wants to be Catholic, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  they can choose it in a second. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  You can't change being like Italian. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=600.6s)]
*  If you're, that's what you are. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=602.9399999999999s)]
*  Like if you're born from there. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=604.66s)]
*  So Jewish, it's kind of one of those things. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=606.18s)]
*  Over time, I think it's probably out of prejudice. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=608.18s)]
*  People make it sound like it's your blood. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=610.34s)]
*  It's fucking not your blood. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=612.06s)]
*  It's like, it's your religion that somewhere along the way [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=613.14s)]
*  somebody chose to believe, but you can change it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=615.18s)]
*  Like, I'm Russian. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=618.22s)]
*  That's my, my family is from Russia. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=619.26s)]
*  Oh, you are? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=621.34s)]
*  I could see that a little bit now. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=622.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  In my family, to be honest, we don't talk, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=625.48s)]
*  like I don't even know that much about the history. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure bad shit happened. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=629.12s)]
*  Like most people don't leave their country [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=630.28s)]
*  just because. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=631.92s)]
*  Dang, you're Russian? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=632.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Russian. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=633.8s)]
*  Dang. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=635.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  Marusky. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=637.04s)]
*  Wow, man. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=637.88s)]
*  That's great, man. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=639.64s)]
*  I don't know, I knew this one Russian girl [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=640.48s)]
*  and she was so sexy, man. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  And God, she invited me over one time [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=643.76s)]
*  and like she was sick or something. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=646.04s)]
*  I brought her some soup and she like [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=648.36s)]
*  was so aggressively trying to fuck that I got so. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=650.52s)]
*  So she didn't feel well? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so that, I was like, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=654.8s)]
*  oh, what do you do here? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=656.52s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  Like. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  See, I'm such a hypochondriac. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=659.56s)]
*  I would, I'd be like, not like you gotta get healthy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=660.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's kind of how I was. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=663.04s)]
*  I was so scared. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  There's like, you know, I kept trying to lead her back [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=665.4s)]
*  to the soup and she kept coming for me. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=667.52s)]
*  And, and I got so scared because she was sick, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=669.88s)]
*  but she was so like aggressive and determined and. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=675.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting, man. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=676.4s)]
*  And she actually went to jail. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=677.56s)]
*  She went to jail. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=678.64s)]
*  I remember she hit me up like years later [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=680.52s)]
*  and I was like, I need somebody to come testify for her [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=682.2199999999999s)]
*  in some thing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  And I couldn't make it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=684.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=686.14s)]
*  I just wanted to sleep in honestly. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=686.9799999999999s)]
*  But. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=688.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=688.9799999999999s)]
*  Like if you're being asked to testify and you're like, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  sorry, I slept in. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=692.6999999999999s)]
*  You must not have really been that close with her [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=694.0999999999999s)]
*  to skip the, you know, skip the trial [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=696.4599999999999s)]
*  or whatever she was going down for. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=699.62s)]
*  She's like, I need somebody to show up. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=701.78s)]
*  Yeah, I guess, I guess my question is like, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=703.62s)]
*  does it feel, do you feel a lot of pressure being Jewish [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  to be successful? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=708.4599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=709.74s)]
*  No, that's interesting. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=711.42s)]
*  No, I don't feel pressured to be successful at all, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=712.42s)]
*  but no, nothing to do with, if anything, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=715.42s)]
*  like I feel like there, no, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=718.1s)]
*  there's a lot of successful Jews. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=719.86s)]
*  My parents weren't like, hey, you're Jewish. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=721.66s)]
*  You better be successful. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=723.26s)]
*  No. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=724.34s)]
*  Oh, maybe that's what it is. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=725.18s)]
*  Maybe I felt a lot of friends, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=726.0s)]
*  a lot of my Jewish friends are successful, you know? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=727.1s)]
*  And so it's like, yeah, I guess I wonder, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=728.74s)]
*  do I feel like that there's a pressure? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=731.62s)]
*  And then all my Jewish friends are always saying [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=733.62s)]
*  that their moms are always driving them nuts. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=734.86s)]
*  And so I guess I started to. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=736.62s)]
*  That. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=737.7s)]
*  I started to put those things together. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=738.54s)]
*  I love my mother. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=739.9s)]
*  She's coming to the Super Bowl with me [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=741.38s)]
*  just to probably get away from my dad for a couple days. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=742.22s)]
*  But my mother's the type of woman, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=745.2600000000001s)]
*  and again, this is a typical, I go home, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=747.5s)]
*  I'll go back to wherever I'm going, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=751.58s)]
*  and I open my suitcase and they'll be like, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=753.34s)]
*  geez, it's hidden in there and all sorts of gadgets. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=756.22s)]
*  She's just overprotective. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  She doesn't, anything I say, I don't want that, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=762.62s)]
*  I don't do this, she'll do it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  She's always, if I could walk around a giant bubble, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=766.74s)]
*  that's what they do. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=771.14s)]
*  Like my grandmother, I remember one time, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=771.98s)]
*  I was looking at colleges and there was a plane crash. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=773.06s)]
*  We were driving. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=775.86s)]
*  And she called, worried, she's like, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=776.98s)]
*  the plane crashed, you all right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=779.02s)]
*  We weren't flying. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=780.34s)]
*  She's like, well, the plane could have landed on you. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=782.18s)]
*  That's the type of thing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=784.62s)]
*  Just a little bit overly protective. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=786.74s)]
*  Okay, interesting. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=789.26s)]
*  But no pressure, no pressure in that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=790.62s)]
*  I mean, I originally wanted to be a gym teacher. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=792.18s)]
*  That was what I graduated actually college with [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=796.22s)]
*  and they would have been fine with it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=798.7s)]
*  They've been supportive, no pressure at all. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=801.0600000000001s)]
*  I think the Jewish thing, from my point of view, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=802.4200000000001s)]
*  it's just super intense on education. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=804.9s)]
*  Do good in school. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=809.14s)]
*  If you were fucking off on school, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=810.46s)]
*  my parents would be like, what are you doing? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=812.62s)]
*  And I did fuck off a little bit at school, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  but they'd be in your grill about that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=816.5400000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=819.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm just curious. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=821.6600000000001s)]
*  And so, in high school, were you kind of a funny guy? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=823.5s)]
*  Were you kind of the guy who was the student council leader? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=828.54s)]
*  What was some of your vibe in high school? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=834.02s)]
*  So yeah, I played sports, hung out with- [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=835.7s)]
*  Or your Riz, actually, which I learned [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=839.3s)]
*  what it means from you and your TikTok. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=840.82s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=843.1s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that either until- [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=843.94s)]
*  You put those fucking kids up on game, fuck them. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=845.62s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=847.74s)]
*  Sorry, I mean, they're good kids. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=848.58s)]
*  So this should give you an insight into, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=851.26s)]
*  and this is again, my parents being like, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=855.74s)]
*  you gotta get your resume right for going to college. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=857.54s)]
*  So I was the vice president of my class, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=860.4599999999999s)]
*  and that was calculated because I didn't wanna do the work. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=863.5799999999999s)]
*  So I was like, I'm not gonna run for president [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=865.9s)]
*  because then you gotta do shit. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=867.26s)]
*  Vice president, you kinda skate, but put it on the resume. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=868.9s)]
*  So that's what I did. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=871.74s)]
*  And then I played sports. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=872.5799999999999s)]
*  So I was just, again, I'd say I ran in the popular crowd [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=874.14s)]
*  by his friends with everybody. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=878.4599999999999s)]
*  A little bit funny. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=879.9399999999999s)]
*  I couldn't get by on looks, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=881.98s)]
*  so if you don't go looks, you go funny. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah, trust me, dude. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=884.6999999999999s)]
*  I feel you. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=886.18s)]
*  I've always been kind of like an eight, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=887.86s)]
*  and you gotta fucking, you gotta. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=890.06s)]
*  An eight. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=891.34s)]
*  You gotta come up with some jokes, yeah. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=892.18s)]
*  Like on looks, I think. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=893.42s)]
*  Out of a 10? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=894.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=895.1s)]
*  That's a fucking super high score. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=895.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't think, you think it's that high? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=898.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=900.02s)]
*  Eight? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=901.3s)]
*  Eight. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=902.14s)]
*  So who's a 10? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=902.98s)]

*  Gruen, with a G. Gruen, no. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=962.58s)]
*  That's surprising because I feel like [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=963.94s)]
*  this dude knows everybody. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=965.1800000000001s)]

*  and Dixie D'Amelo, yeah, she broke up [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=976.14s)]
*  with her boyfriend at the time. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=980.86s)]
*  You may not, these are huge. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=981.9s)]
*  Yeah, I know she is. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so she was like the original [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=984.54s)]
*  kind of it girl on TikTok. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=985.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=987.2199999999999s)]
*  And it broke into Twitter. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=988.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=989.9399999999999s)]
*  And they broke up and everyone was talking about Twitter [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=990.78s)]
*  and I was like, who the fuck are these people? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=992.62s)]
*  Gruen, who is Josh Richards manager, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=994.74s)]
*  reached out, he's like, hey, he'll explain it to you. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=997.02s)]
*  Want to do a Instagram live with him. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=999.2199999999999s)]
*  So I was like, sure, we did it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1001.54s)]
*  And I was surprised, we kind of like had some chemistry. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1004.14s)]
*  Like who is this kid? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1006.38s)]
*  Snapchat reached out after we did that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1007.2199999999999s)]
*  Like would you guys do a show on Snapchat? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1009.8599999999999s)]
*  I had no interest because I wasn't, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1012.42s)]
*  like Snapchat just wasn't where I wanted to be. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1014.78s)]
*  TikTok, I knew was something. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1017.2199999999999s)]
*  It's like, I'm sure you view the world at times like, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1018.9399999999999s)]
*  all right, I got to get my name, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1021.54s)]
*  like who are these kids on TikTok? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1022.78s)]
*  Because Parcel had been around for a while, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1024.7s)]
*  but nobody knew us on TikTok, it was a younger demo. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1026.22s)]
*  So to me, partnering with him who was big on TikTok [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1028.86s)]
*  was like, all right, that's going to get me, Barstool, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1032.7s)]
*  maybe this new audience. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1034.98s)]
*  And that's where it came from. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1036.1000000000001s)]
*  He wanted to get maybe a little more credible [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1037.06s)]
*  with like an older crowd who had been around. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1039.3400000000001s)]
*  I want to get the TikTok crowd to know who we were. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1041.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's where it came from. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1044.26s)]
*  It's great. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1045.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I came on that show. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1046.38s)]
*  So Michael Gruen is his manager. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1047.3s)]
*  He was. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1048.98s)]
*  He was, okay. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1049.82s)]
*  And he like just connected people. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1050.74s)]
*  He, I still hear from him once. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1053.5s)]
*  Yeah, when I first met him, no joke to Gruen, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1056.26s)]
*  the first thing I said to him [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1060.1000000000001s)]
*  was he was the most obnoxious human I ever met. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1062.02s)]
*  Is he really? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1064.14s)]
*  He grew on me, but he can come across as sandpaper [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1065.26s)]
*  when you meet him, but I do like him now. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1068.26s)]
*  He's growing on people, huh? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1070.66s)]
*  Yeah, well played. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1072.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh wow, and yeah, I would like to maybe meet that guy. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1073.5s)]
*  But then, yeah, it's interesting [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1077.9s)]
*  if people kind of get on your nerves, you know. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1081.22s)]
*  I had this dude that used to kind of, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1083.5800000000002s)]
*  would always kind of bite the air a little bit. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1085.78s)]
*  He had a little bit of a, just a little hitch in him, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1087.66s)]
*  like Val Kilmer, like Iceman. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1091.46s)]
*  Like that, like he was eating a berry off a tree [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1094.82s)]
*  or something, you know. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1096.86s)]
*  And he would do that just every now and then, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1098.18s)]
*  and like you can deal with it for a while, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1099.74s)]
*  but after about that 50th berry, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1101.66s)]
*  you gotta fucking shut him down [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1103.3s)]
*  or you gotta leave the room. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1104.66s)]
*  Do you know the part I'm talking about [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1105.74s)]
*  with Iceman and Top Gun? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1107.66s)]
*  He just, he's like, that's right Iceman, I am dangerous. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1110.22s)]
*  I just bite the air. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1113.22s)]
*  He does the bite. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1114.06s)]
*  Oh, he does that? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1114.9s)]
*  He bites the air. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1115.74s)]
*  Yeah, classic scene. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1116.58s)]
*  So in high school, so yeah, I could see that, man. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1119.02s)]
*  I could see you, did you feel like you had kind of like that? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1121.38s)]
*  So obviously you knew that you could kind of relate [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1124.38s)]
*  to everybody then a little bit? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1126.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1127.14s)]
*  Cause sometimes as you get older, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1128.14s)]
*  you start to learn just some of your skills, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1129.54s)]
*  you're like, oh, I kind of can fit in wherever. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1130.8600000000001s)]

*  I didn't really do great with the girls at all [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1141.58s)]
*  in high school. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1144.1s)]

*  Probably a lot of people like me. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1695.94s)]
*  Normal, growing up, played sports, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1698.02s)]
*  ran with like the popular crowd in school, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1700.1399999999999s)]

*  Do you love sports? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1710.8999999999999s)]

*  I love gambling. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1713.94s)]
*  Obviously it's what we do now, so that worked out. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1714.86s)]
*  Like before I started Barstool, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1717.22s)]
*  I wanted to get into that industry. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1719.26s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1720.58s)]
*  I flew out to Vegas, tried to do all the stuff. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1721.42s)]
*  So it's worked out perfectly for me. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1723.06s)]
*  I'm probably like one of the few guys [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1725.42s)]
*  who's made money through gambling. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1726.66s)]
*  Most people get wiped out. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1728.18s)]
*  So yeah, no, I'm a big sports fan, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1730.38s)]
*  and obviously it's been a core part of what we do. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1731.98s)]
*  So it makes me, like I'm not, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1734.74s)]
*  maybe I'm not getting arrested and going to jail [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1738.26s)]
*  if we're not doing Barstool. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1740.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1764.58s)]
*  Yeah, because so we were bought by a company called Penn, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1765.42s)]
*  and they have LaBerge. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1767.66s)]
*  We also have like standalone. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1769.58s)]
*  So we're actually getting one here in Nashville. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1770.82s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1772.34s)]
*  Yeah, there'll be a Barstool Sports Bar. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1773.18s)]
*  It's where like the old Joe's Crab Shack used to be. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1775.1s)]
*  Oh nice. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1777.6599999999999s)]
*  So it's a good spot. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1778.5s)]
*  So I think it will eventually go most states, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1780.74s)]
*  but it, so gambling became legal to bet on sports [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1784.26s)]
*  outside of Vegas, maybe two years ago, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1787.7s)]
*  two and a half, something like that. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1790.1399999999999s)]
*  They repealed some federal law, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1791.28s)]
*  and now it's up to the states. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1792.98s)]
*  So they just decide state by state. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1794.1s)]
*  So I think we're live in like maybe 11 or 12 states. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1795.7s)]
*  And do you lobby for that somehow? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1799.1s)]
*  Or you just, that's just let the world do that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1800.94s)]
*  Our parent company lobbies for it, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1803.66s)]
*  and all the different companies [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1805.5s)]
*  that are involved in that lobby for it, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1807.66s)]
*  and then there's people lobby against it. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1809.5400000000002s)]
*  So I have nothing to do with it, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1811.0600000000002s)]
*  but yeah, there's a lot of politicking [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1812.5400000000002s)]
*  going around with that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1813.94s)]
*  Do you get more joy out of making like a big wager [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1815.46s)]
*  on one thing or hitting like a crazy parlay, you know? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1817.94s)]
*  I don't do as much as parlay. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1821.22s)]
*  So like betting on one thing, winning it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've bet my whole life, so it's just, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1824.8200000000002s)]
*  but yeah, no, it's, I love it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1827.1000000000001s)]
*  I love gambling. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1829.9s)]
*  Yeah, you like to gamble. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1831.14s)]
*  Do you feel like that's just like a thing [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1832.26s)]
*  you like to do just with sports, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1833.9s)]
*  or even like kind of with everything, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1835.1000000000001s)]
*  like you kind of like to go kind of like [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1836.38s)]
*  the alternate route a little bit? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1838.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's, I definitely, even Barstool, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1840.3400000000001s)]
*  like I think being an entrepreneur [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1842.98s)]
*  kind of is like gambling, different respect, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1845.3400000000001s)]
*  but I saw Barstool with nothing really, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1847.74s)]
*  and everything we made, we put back into it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1850.14s)]
*  For the most part, work, but you know, we did concerts. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1852.98s)]
*  I thought we were going out of business at one point, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1855.46s)]
*  because I put all our money into like a concert tour, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1857.1000000000001s)]
*  and it kind of flopped. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1859.46s)]
*  Who was it, like Third Eye Blind or something? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1860.3s)]
*  No, believe it or not, so we did this thing, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1862.5800000000002s)]
*  we had never left downtown Boston ever, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1865.3400000000001s)]
*  and I was like, all right, we gotta see [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1867.5400000000002s)]
*  if we're big outside of Boston, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1869.8600000000001s)]
*  and we had liquor sponsors at the time, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1871.66s)]
*  and they were like, well, you know, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1873.94s)]
*  we can't sponsor you if you're going to colleges, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1875.6200000000001s)]
*  and we're like, well, what if we make it a music tour? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1878.42s)]
*  Could you? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1880.3000000000002s)]
*  They said, yeah, so we had this kid, Sam Adams. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1881.14s)]
*  It kind of blew up, and he's got some big songs. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1883.8200000000002s)]
*  We did it, we did six stops, and it went really well, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1886.1000000000001s)]
*  bigger than we ever thought, and I looked at it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1891.1399999999999s)]
*  So we originally thought we were going like frats, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1894.86s)]
*  and we go to UMass, and the actual school calls are like, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1896.6999999999998s)]
*  hey, we're getting all these requests for tickets, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1900.1399999999999s)]
*  what is this? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1901.82s)]
*  So we went from the frat to the actual like Mullen Center, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1902.6399999999999s)]
*  which is the gymnasium, sold out in a second. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1906.26s)]
*  My brain's gone, the business side's like, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1909.08s)]
*  hey, if I can recreate this with like big talent, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1910.86s)]
*  I may be onto something. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1915.02s)]
*  So we had a music tour. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1916.4199999999998s)]
*  It was headlined by Mike Posner. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1918.4199999999998s)]
*  Do you remember like, Cooler Than Me at the time? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1920.42s)]
*  I saw Mike two weeks ago, yeah. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1922.54s)]
*  So that song just came out. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1924.14s)]
*  He was the headliner. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1925.5800000000002s)]
*  It was him, Wale, and Mac Miller for 1,500 bucks. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1927.02s)]
*  That's how much we were paying him to play. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1932.18s)]
*  So he was the third guy coming up on it, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1934.14s)]
*  and nobody fucking bought. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1937.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, people bought tickets, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1938.3400000000001s)]
*  same amount as the first time we went around. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1939.9s)]
*  It turned out our crowd, they weren't coming necessarily [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1942.3000000000002s)]
*  for who we were booking. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1945.74s)]
*  They're coming because Barstool was on it. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1947.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1948.94s)]
*  So we were fucking wiped out. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1949.78s)]
*  I actually hated Posner. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1950.62s)]
*  He didn't promote the shit. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1951.8999999999999s)]
*  He didn't promote it at all. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1952.94s)]
*  Not his fault, his agent's fault. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1954.1s)]
*  So that was a disaster. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1956.66s)]
*  And then we moved from that because it was kind of like, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1958.18s)]
*  all right, if people are coming for Barstool, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1961.62s)]
*  not the talent, does it really matter? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1964.1399999999999s)]
*  And we went into EDM. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1966.58s)]
*  So you lost your butt on that? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1968.22s)]
*  Smoked. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1970.78s)]
*  Because you had to pay the act so much? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1971.7s)]
*  Pay the act and I rented the buildings. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1973.66s)]
*  So we were going, I was paying like. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1975.62s)]
*  Yeah, the big on that building's big. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1977.74s)]
*  A hundred grand or something a night [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1979.14s)]
*  and we weren't doing it. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1980.8200000000002s)]
*  I thought I was gonna have to pay the full thing. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1981.8600000000001s)]
*  We had to cancel a lot of the shows. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  So that was a disaster. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1986.22s)]
*  And then we came up with something called the Blackout Tour, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1988.5800000000002s)]
*  which essentially was a DJ playing EDM music. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1991.1200000000001s)]
*  This is at the infancy of EDM and it exploded. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=1995.3600000000001s)]
*  Like to the point we had, I bought all our own production. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2000.0200000000002s)]
*  You could go to an EDM show, it looked like ours. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2003.1000000000001s)]
*  We had a full crew doing it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2005.5400000000002s)]
*  I thought. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2007.48s)]
*  And were you into it? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2008.32s)]
*  Were you like doing the pills and everything? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2009.16s)]
*  Were you like partying and shit? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2010.48s)]
*  No, we had, we did three shows a week [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2011.32s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2014.56s)]
*  Like we had a whole crew driving around, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2015.44s)]
*  setting up the lights, renting venues. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2017.92s)]
*  I thought I was gonna become so rich [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2020.66s)]
*  that I'd be like Bezos and retire. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2023.64s)]
*  We were clearing like 250 grand a show. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2025.4s)]
*  It was nuts and we weren't paying for talent. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2028.08s)]
*  So we're charging 50 bucks a ticket, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2030.4s)]
*  selling out literally. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2032.4s)]
*  And it was just like an EDM party show? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2034.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2035.68s)]
*  So you guys were just in Boston [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2036.8s)]
*  and this crew is now traveling, doing shows for you? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2038.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2040.48s)]
*  Like have you ever heard of this festival like Bamboozle? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2041.32s)]
*  It's a big festival in New Jersey. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2043.8799999999999s)]
*  So the Bonnaroo Bamboozle is like one of those type things. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2045.76s)]
*  And we were on a call with Live Nation. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2050.24s)]
*  I'll never forget this call. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2052.28s)]
*  We want you to close. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2053.6s)]
*  The last music they had was Bon Jovi. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2055.92s)]
*  We want you to come on after Bon Jovi and close it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2058.44s)]
*  We'll pay you 250 grand just to show up. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2061.52s)]
*  And before we could say anything, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2063.88s)]
*  we know it's not a lot of money. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2065.44s)]
*  It's cheap, but you'll introduce your music [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2066.84s)]
*  to so many new people. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2069.84s)]
*  And I was like, wait, wait, we don't have music. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2071.48s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2073.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no one to, what do you mean you have no music? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2074.52s)]
*  The only thing they saw was our ticket sales [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2076.64s)]
*  in their system. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2079.08s)]
*  Whenever we put tickets in, they were gone in 10 seconds. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2080.08s)]
*  So we like did that, turned into a phone thing. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2082.6s)]
*  But that was because of the Barstool name again. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2085.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2086.88s)]
*  So you're still like, we're just selling EDM. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2087.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, dude, cause where I'm from, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2089.32s)]
*  if somebody showed up with damn two laser lights [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2090.32s)]
*  and a fucking flood beam, dude, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2092.52s)]
*  people would pay $50 and get out there. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2094.12s)]
*  They went nuts for it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2096.0s)]
*  They went, and it was like we had, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2096.8399999999997s)]
*  like we had Avicii like playing our thing for like no money. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2099.68s)]
*  It was before the DJ thing took off. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2103.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so you did actually have talent coming to the. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2105.48s)]
*  Yeah, we rotate, but we wouldn't pay a lot. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2108.64s)]
*  Like we paid maybe two grand for Avicii. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2110.4s)]
*  It was before the DJ boom. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2114.48s)]
*  Then the DJ boom started happening [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2116.7999999999997s)]
*  and a couple of things happened. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  We had our name and we're always sort of controversial, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2120.64s)]
*  but if somebody OD'd at EDM Vegas, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2123.4s)]
*  we would be mentioned. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2127.08s)]
*  It'd be like Barstool, Blacko tore part of this [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2128.08s)]
*  and people would be calling me. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2130.96s)]
*  Insurance went through the roof [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2132.2000000000003s)]
*  and news crews were following like our production around, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2134.2400000000002s)]
*  just looking for controversy. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2137.88s)]
*  So the whole thing, as quick as it came, it disappeared. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2139.7200000000003s)]
*  Because of insurance really? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2143.4s)]
*  Insurance, EDM, it went from, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2144.44s)]
*  there'd be one EDM show at a college a month [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2147.44s)]
*  to there were three a week. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2150.64s)]
*  We were playing Avicii's music [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2152.44s)]
*  and Avicii was gonna be there tomorrow. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2154.0s)]
*  So a whole host of factors and I was investing. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2155.52s)]
*  This is the gambling part. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2158.92s)]
*  Every cent I made, I'm like, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2160.16s)]
*  let's get the next biggest laser. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2161.64s)]
*  Let's get this, let's get that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2163.04s)]
*  So we put it all back in. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2164.6800000000003s)]
*  At the end of the day, we were probably net even. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2166.36s)]
*  We didn't make money, we didn't lose money. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2168.6s)]
*  When it comes to business, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2170.96s)]
*  has that been a, was that a tough thing to realize? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2172.28s)]
*  Even just as my own business and world has grown, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2175.56s)]
*  it's tough sometimes to realize, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2179.2000000000003s)]
*  especially if you don't come from a lot, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2180.6s)]
*  to reinvest in stuff. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2182.4s)]
*  Has that always, I mean, obviously in that instance, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2183.88s)]
*  it kind of evened out. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2187.0s)]
*  But has that been a tough thing for you to realize [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2188.6s)]
*  or is that like, what? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2191.52s)]
*  No, for me, that's been like, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2193.7999999999997s)]
*  that's just something I think that's in my blood. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2197.64s)]
*  That goes back to the gambling. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2200.04s)]
*  I've made money, I don't think I need money. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2201.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't have any for a long time. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2205.04s)]
*  Not that I was living like I could eat. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2206.3199999999997s)]
*  But no, I just have a risk taker personality. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2208.88s)]
*  So I never, I'm always pushing things into the middle. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2212.28s)]
*  Now, I'm at a different stage in my life. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2216.48s)]
*  So would I risk it all now? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2219.32s)]
*  I've been doing this for 20 years. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2220.56s)]
*  Be like, if I thought there was a huge opportunity [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2222.1200000000003s)]
*  and I put everything back, probably not. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2223.92s)]
*  But at that point, we were still pushing. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2225.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  That's so cool, man, because you kind of became [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2230.0s)]
*  like this guy who's like, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2232.04s)]
*  I'll fucking put it on the table right now. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2233.1200000000003s)]
*  Even throughout the pandemic and stuff, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  the way you were championing, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2238.88s)]
*  keeping small businesses open and what are we doing here? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2242.0s)]
*  Not afraid to interview Trump or to talk about [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2246.04s)]
*  conservative views or even look at them, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2249.44s)]
*  when a lot of the world was like, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2252.6000000000004s)]
*  mainstream media was kind of shunning them. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2254.6000000000004s)]
*  Is that kind of a little bit of the high? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2257.84s)]
*  Because I'm just wondering, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2259.36s)]
*  because gambling is kind of a high, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2261.0s)]
*  but there's a little bit of high [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2262.48s)]
*  in fucking gambling with yourself as well. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2263.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's always, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2265.44s)]
*  we never look for fights with that stuff. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2266.92s)]
*  I'm pretty much a free speaker. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2268.96s)]
*  I have had to tone it down, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2271.0s)]
*  which is, I got a lot of haters out there [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2273.04s)]
*  and I always say that probably the number one benefit [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2276.0s)]
*  they have that they don't realize is that pen, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2278.84s)]
*  the gambling company bought us because we are regulated. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2281.44s)]
*  So it's the first time since I've been doing Barstool, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2284.0s)]
*  people can sort of get at me through a side door. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2288.44s)]
*  Like I don't care what you fucking say about me. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2291.28s)]
*  I really don't and I have thick skin [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2292.88s)]
*  and if you're gonna come at me, I'll come at you. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2294.52s)]
*  Like I've staked out fucking a New York Times reporter, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2297.56s)]
*  like who was, I know digging through my fucking past [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  and life and trying to like really write [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2305.56s)]
*  a nasty hit piece about me. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2307.52s)]
*  It's like, if you wanna fucking talk to me, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2309.3599999999997s)]
*  let's fucking talk. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2311.12s)]
*  And I did like a 48 hours, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2312.08s)]
*  like I literally parked my car with my camera guy [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2314.9199999999996s)]
*  outside the house for like six hours [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2317.56s)]
*  and just waited for them to come out, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2319.56s)]
*  ran out and like confronted them. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2320.9599999999996s)]
*  I like doing that, I like. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2323.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like I'm a confrontational person by nature. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2327.68s)]
*  So that part of me has always been there. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2330.56s)]
*  I have had to tone it down a little bit [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2333.8799999999997s)]
*  because I don't, Barstool is so much bigger [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  than just me now and what I do does affect other people. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2339.2s)]
*  And I say that like I go on Fox News, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2344.0s)]
*  I'll go on Tucker Carlson [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2345.52s)]
*  and he knows I'm not overly like political, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2346.7599999999998s)]
*  but every time I go on there, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2349.04s)]
*  that affects how people view the whole company [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2350.3199999999997s)]
*  and some people may have different views, whatever. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2353.3599999999997s)]
*  So that I do sort of pay attention to, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2355.52s)]
*  it still doesn't affect necessarily what I do. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2358.92s)]
*  Like people are mad within our company [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2360.92s)]
*  that I interviewed Trump. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2362.6s)]
*  But you gotta make the decisions [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2364.4s)]
*  you think are right at the time. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2366.44s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that interview was so funny, man, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2368.08s)]
*  when he was like, you're like, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2370.92s)]
*  you ever just rattle off a tweet and then just kind of. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2372.64s)]
*  I still think I'm the only guy [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2374.8s)]
*  who's ever gotten him to say like, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2375.92s)]
*  yeah, I regret something. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2377.48s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I do regret it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2378.64s)]
*  I don't know that he's ever been like, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2380.4s)]
*  I regret something in his life, except for that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2382.2s)]
*  That was so good. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2385.6s)]
*  But he's like, yeah, you just write it and go to sleep. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2386.44s)]
*  You wake up, you're like, what the fuck did I write? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2389.04s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I've done that. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2390.88s)]
*  I've done that. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2392.64s)]
*  Listen, people have such strong opinions about him. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2393.96s)]
*  I think right off the bat, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2397.84s)]
*  he kind of realized I wasn't like out to be like, gotcha. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2399.08s)]
*  So he was good with me. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2402.84s)]
*  He was down to earth. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2404.96s)]
*  He was not like his guard wasn't up. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2405.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a surreal experience. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2408.88s)]
*  Oh, I can only imagine. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  I remember watching that interview [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2412.12s)]
*  and watching you sit there. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2413.92s)]
*  I'm like, God, dude, that'd be so... [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2415.4s)]
*  First of all, Dave's doing this. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2416.7200000000003s)]
*  He's actually going and whereas everybody else [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2419.1200000000003s)]
*  was just making fun of Trump [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2422.2000000000003s)]
*  or not even giving him a chance. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2424.32s)]
*  I mean, mainstream media did not... [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, he didn't help himself at certain points, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2427.6000000000004s)]
*  but they didn't help him out of the gate [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2429.6400000000003s)]
*  or give him a chance. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2431.0400000000004s)]
*  But you were right there. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2432.6800000000003s)]
*  It's sort of, there's definitely a similarity with him. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2434.0s)]
*  And it's like, if you come at him, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2438.0800000000004s)]
*  he'll be a dick 10 times harder back to you. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2441.0s)]
*  When you're president, that can cause issues. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2445.0s)]
*  I have so many things that people still bring up with me [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2447.4s)]
*  and they'll bring up quotes or whatever. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2450.6000000000004s)]
*  And somebody who came after me [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2452.32s)]
*  and I'm being so sarcastic and an asshole back to them [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2453.48s)]
*  and then they take what it is. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2456.96s)]
*  So I see it, but you're right. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2458.5200000000004s)]
*  He's... [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2460.4s)]
*  He was the president. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2463.88s)]
*  So I'm not the president. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2465.6000000000004s)]
*  So I can do a lot of things. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2468.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm not trying to be presidential. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2469.36s)]
*  And I think some people are like, well, you should be. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2470.88s)]
*  And he's a totally different cat. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2472.84s)]
*  Oh, I remember when he was running, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2475.7200000000003s)]
*  I thought right at the beginning, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2476.92s)]
*  I was like, he's gonna win. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2478.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, he just sounds like, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2479.1200000000003s)]
*  he just, it seemed like it's not a part of a bigger plan. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2481.8s)]
*  But then I wonder once he got in office, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2485.48s)]
*  is it just too convoluted in there? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2487.8s)]
*  Or was he just kind of overshooting his own mark? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2490.1600000000003s)]
*  That's what I kind of wonder. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2493.8s)]
*  Because in the beginning, he was kind of like, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2495.7200000000003s)]
*  even though he wasn't really like this [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2497.84s)]
*  came from nothing kind of guy, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2499.84s)]
*  he was kind of talking to a lot of people [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2501.28s)]
*  that I think felt underrepresented [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2503.1200000000003s)]
*  or people who want some tradition in the country. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2505.6000000000004s)]
*  Totally. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2509.88s)]
*  And it's like, he was dismissed by so many people. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2510.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think that almost made him more popular [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2513.5600000000004s)]
*  with the people he was resonating. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2516.5600000000004s)]
*  Like any way you look at it, he won the election. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2518.0400000000004s)]
*  So there's a large, large, large portion of the country [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2521.0s)]
*  he was speaking to. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2524.4s)]
*  And people are so dismissive. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2525.6000000000004s)]
*  If you weren't on his side, if you like Trump, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2528.0800000000004s)]
*  you're like a racist asshole idiot. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2530.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2532.08s)]
*  So you're saying like more than half the country [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2532.92s)]
*  have those people. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2535.36s)]
*  Now I'm sure there's definitely a subsection [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2536.2s)]
*  within his demo that do fit that description, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2538.52s)]
*  but certainly not everybody. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2542.36s)]
*  And you just paint everybody with one brush [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2543.84s)]
*  and actually made him more popular doing that. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2545.84s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2548.36s)]
*  I've said before, he's intentionally divisive, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2549.32s)]
*  which I want people to get along. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2552.32s)]
*  So that's where I kind of lose it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2555.56s)]
*  And it's not just him, it's both sides. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2558.0s)]
*  It's like you need somebody who at least honestly [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2559.8s)]
*  wants to bring people together. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2563.6800000000003s)]
*  And I don't know who that's gonna fucking be. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2565.4s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2567.4s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2568.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's not Biden because he's so dismissive [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2569.5600000000004s)]
*  of the people who do like Trump. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2572.44s)]
*  It's like they're just, everything's now. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2575.1200000000003s)]
*  It is. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2577.2400000000002s)]
*  And so that sucks. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2578.84s)]
*  It is. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2580.1600000000003s)]
*  It takes away almost half the dating pool, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2581.0s)]
*  I think for a lot of people too. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2582.2000000000003s)]
*  I think about that sometimes. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2583.1600000000003s)]
*  It does. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2584.44s)]
*  It used to be, it didn't matter. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2585.28s)]
*  It used to be, it didn't matter so much. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2588.76s)]
*  If someone like you'd have husbands and wives [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2592.1600000000003s)]
*  that had different political, just kind of whatever. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2594.44s)]
*  It's toxic now. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2596.6400000000003s)]
*  It's gotten weird. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2598.0800000000004s)]
*  Would you ever run for like a governor or something? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2599.48s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  I ran for mayor of Boston. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2602.52s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2604.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2604.96s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2605.8s)]
*  I tried to, they fucking blackballed me. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2606.6200000000003s)]
*  So this was- [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2607.88s)]
*  I'm talking the most Boston shit. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2609.7200000000003s)]
*  They did, they did. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2611.8s)]
*  This is, I'm telling you, I was doing that black- [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2612.6400000000003s)]
*  People get blackballed of all kinds of stuff. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2614.2000000000003s)]
*  I was doing the blackout tour. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2616.2000000000003s)]
*  I told you about. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2617.8799999999997s)]
*  So we rented these venues. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2619.0s)]
*  House of Blues is a venue in Boston, like 3000 people. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2620.52s)]
*  We sold it out, I think seven straight days [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2623.9599999999996s)]
*  in like 30 seconds. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2626.2s)]
*  We were doing it. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2627.56s)]
*  So there's a ton of schools in Boston. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2628.4399999999996s)]
*  So like, hey, Monday it's a BU parcel blackout. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2630.24s)]
*  Tuesday, BC, Wednesday, Northeastern. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2633.16s)]
*  So all the kids at each school would buy it, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2635.8799999999997s)]
*  sold it out instantly. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2638.12s)]
*  The police were so fucking like bat. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2639.56s)]
*  They were breathless. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2643.52s)]
*  Have you ever heard of kids getting breathless [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2644.3599999999997s)]
*  in line, going down the line? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2646.52s)]

*  And you had to basically get, what was it? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2660.8s)]
*  Like 12,000 signatures to get on the ballot. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2663.8s)]
*  Now there's two parts to the signature. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2667.24s)]
*  You had to be able to read the signature [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2668.92s)]
*  and the person had to be a registered voter. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2670.96s)]
*  I hired a full blown agency. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2673.3199999999997s)]
*  You have professional people get it. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2676.72s)]
*  Like get the signatures. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2678.8799999999997s)]
*  We had like 20,000. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2680.16s)]
*  They just ruled 10,000 of them didn't count. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2681.6s)]
*  There's no way to appeal. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2684.64s)]
*  There's no nothing. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2685.7999999999997s)]
*  So I didn't make it onto the ballot. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2686.64s)]
*  But yeah, I was like trying to do it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2688.64s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2691.3199999999997s)]
*  But other than that, no, who needs that? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2692.24s)]
*  I don't, who would ever, I've used this quote [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2694.08s)]
*  like the movie Gladiator when Maximus, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2696.9599999999996s)]
*  it's the king wants Maximus to be the leader of Rome. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2700.76s)]
*  He's like, no thanks, dude. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2706.6000000000004s)]
*  Who wants that headache? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2707.84s)]
*  And he's like, that's exactly why you have to do it. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2708.7200000000003s)]
*  Who would, who in their right mind [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2711.1600000000003s)]
*  would want to be in politics? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2713.96s)]
*  Well, like the person you want in politics [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2716.1600000000003s)]
*  should be somebody who's not doing it for ego, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2718.88s)]
*  who truly cares about like the wellbeing of the people, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2720.96s)]
*  not doing it to money, get rich. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2724.1600000000003s)]
*  None of the politicians do that. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2726.1600000000003s)]
*  Because why would you? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2728.2400000000002s)]

*  Like you have no ill will. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2736.64s)]
*  He's gonna go down as one of the most hated dudes [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2738.6s)]

*  I mean, I could see it. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2746.48s)]
*  If somebody gets to say you get to be president, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2747.44s)]
*  everybody wants to be, or a little bit. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2749.92s)]
*  Were you? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2752.04s)]
*  I mean, maybe for like a couple hours. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2753.04s)]
*  I don't know if I would do a full term. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2755.4s)]
*  I think I'd want to be in the office [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2758.6s)]
*  and like walk down and see like the whole curtains. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2760.8399999999997s)]

*  Yeah, which is cool. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2765.12s)]
*  But the amount of hate and the, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2766.6s)]
*  like I get so much hate and it's all political. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2768.2s)]
*  Like people who don't like me always, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2770.8799999999997s)]
*  if you don't like Dave Portland, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2773.3599999999997s)]
*  I can go to your Twitter and within three, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2774.52s)]
*  you have something political on your timeline. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2776.08s)]
*  And it's like, who needs that? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2778.48s)]

*  Like when I went and visited Trump, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2782.72s)]
*  everyone's so pro Trump. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2785.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like maybe he doesn't even, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2786.8s)]
*  the hate doesn't get to him on a level. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2788.4s)]
*  I don't know, but no, I won't never run. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2790.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2792.5600000000004s)]
*  But do you think 10 years from now, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2793.6400000000003s)]
*  you'd be like, oh yeah, I'm not fucking around. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2795.1200000000003s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2796.4s)]
*  Wow. No. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2797.4s)]
*  I think we would, I would, I mean, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2798.5200000000004s)]
*  I guess part of me would like to see you have, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2800.84s)]
*  but then also I sometimes feel like politics is just this, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2803.1200000000003s)]
*  like it's this shell company for actual real leaders, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2807.36s)]
*  which is a lot of it is in the tech world these days. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2813.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And even if you look at like, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2816.7599999999998s)]
*  you mentioned the Barstool Fund, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2817.8799999999997s)]
*  which we gave away 50 million basically. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2819.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2822.2799999999997s)]
*  Like the government couldn't do that. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2823.12s)]
*  They move so fucking slow. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2824.68s)]
*  If you actually want to get stuff done, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2826.68s)]
*  it's way easier to do it the way I did it, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2828.8799999999997s)]
*  which is we just set it up 24 hours later, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2831.3199999999997s)]
*  the money's going in. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2833.64s)]
*  And the second the money comes in, the money's going out. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2834.72s)]
*  They did, the government basically did nothing [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2837.3999999999996s)]
*  for like small business. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2840.3199999999997s)]
*  They're still talking about now and so much fraud [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2841.3999999999996s)]
*  with the PPP and shit like that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2844.24s)]
*  So I don't know if it's hard. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2846.2s)]
*  Yeah. And if you really want to get stuff done, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2849.2799999999997s)]
*  you can get stuff done, not within, you know, the government. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2851.72s)]
*  Well, it's almost becoming more like that. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2855.68s)]
*  I think in America these days, it's like, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2857.24s)]
*  there's all the, like, you know, there's a few kind, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2861.12s)]
*  there's less companies, there's less mom and pop places. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2864.2s)]
*  There's just a few larger companies. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2866.6s)]
*  Which sucks. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2868.0s)]
*  Oh, totally, man. It's ridiculous. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2868.8399999999997s)]
*  I wish we had never done so much globalization. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2870.6s)]
*  I don't know a lot about that kind of stuff, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2872.52s)]
*  but it's like, you know, the kid down the street, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2874.76s)]
*  it used to be their dad worked at the factory in the town [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2878.0s)]
*  and they were proud of like, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2880.48s)]
*  if their dad's factory made tables, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2882.28s)]
*  they were proud of the table they had in their house. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2883.88s)]
*  My dad made this, you know? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2885.44s)]
*  And there was like a sense of like, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2887.04s)]
*  you were doing something now, your table comes from China. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2888.88s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2892.52s)]
*  The dad's doing pills. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2893.56s)]
*  The kid is in the other room, you know, cooking pills. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2894.76s)]
*  And then there's a guy in China making a table. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2897.8s)]
*  He gets shipped off. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2899.92s)]
*  He never sees, they're just like, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2901.08s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of a very small example, but. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2903.0s)]
*  No, that was a small business. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2905.68s)]
*  We look for like generational [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2907.4s)]
*  and that was what was so sad about it. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2908.92s)]
*  Like nobody was helping these people. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2910.64s)]
*  It really was crazy. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2912.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, you can't have customers, right? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2913.6s)]
*  But we're not gonna give you the money. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2916.48s)]
*  So like, what do they think is gonna happen? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2917.84s)]
*  It's like that to me was always the wildest part. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2919.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2922.96s)]
*  And again, I mean, you've built up your career [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2924.16s)]
*  over the time, the bar still was the same. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2926.68s)]
*  I always looked at like, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=2928.72s)]

*  Yeah, hired her up. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3253.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh dude, I was in love with her, dude. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3254.68s)]
*  Yeah, hired her out of a tanning salon. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3256.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I could see that. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3258.7999999999997s)]
*  McAfee, Pat McAfee was us. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3260.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3262.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've had, we have a pretty good roster. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3262.8399999999997s)]
*  How do you pick talent? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3266.4399999999996s)]
*  Like do you, like, now obviously, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3267.3999999999996s)]
*  people end up usually speaking mostly of people's successes, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3269.8s)]
*  right? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3272.44s)]
*  Do you feel like you've had a good eye for it [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3273.28s)]
*  or do you feel like you've had just as many hits and misses? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3275.0400000000004s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  No, we definitely have a good eye for it [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3277.96s)]
*  and we have misses for sure. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3278.8s)]
*  I think though the biggest thing, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3280.48s)]
*  we have an eye for it and we don't control people at all. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3283.7200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, we hire somebody and then it's like, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3287.36s)]
*  you do you and hopefully they find the way. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3290.84s)]
*  Like Caleb, using example, like we saw him, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3294.5600000000004s)]
*  he was running up and down the sidelines of North Carolina. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3297.36s)]
*  He was like, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3300.1200000000003s)]
*  Because they wouldn't, because he never started. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3300.96s)]
*  Yeah, and he wasn't even uniform. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3303.0s)]
*  His title was like, I think the professor of morale [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3305.1600000000003s)]
*  or director of morale. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3308.8s)]
*  So he had his blonde hair, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3310.32s)]
*  he'd wear like a ex North Carolina professional football [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3311.4s)]
*  player who was now in the league, their number. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3315.84s)]
*  We saw him on TV, like, who the fuck is this kid? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3317.76s)]
*  We had him on one of our shows. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3320.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, oh, he's got a weird brain. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3321.6400000000003s)]
*  That's what we say. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3324.0s)]
*  Like we look for weird brains, unique guys. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3324.84s)]
*  And we hired him and it's like, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3328.28s)]
*  Caleb, do whatever you want. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3329.6400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, he kind of, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3330.84s)]
*  he was always talented and funny, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3332.2400000000002s)]
*  bounced around kind of trying to find his niche. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3334.0s)]
*  And then he, the Sunday conversation, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  which is now his kind of trademark thing and is great, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3338.28s)]
*  that took a couple of years for him to like, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3341.4s)]
*  fit that exact perfect role. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3344.2000000000003s)]
*  And we just let people sort of do that. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3346.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think it's the combo. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3349.2000000000003s)]
*  We have a good eye for talent, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3350.88s)]
*  but more so we are so free in letting, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3352.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if that's just we're lazy or whatever, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3356.72s)]
*  but we never tell people what to do. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3358.48s)]
*  It's like, you're hired, we'll give you the resources, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3360.9599999999996s)]
*  do whatever you want. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3363.8399999999997s)]
*  And we've had a lot of hits because of it. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3365.16s)]
*  Like PMT, which is big cat. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3367.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3369.4399999999996s)]
*  Like that was all his idea. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3370.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, totally. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3371.56s)]
*  Like I thought podcasts, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3373.6s)]
*  when I first heard about podcasts, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3374.9199999999996s)]
*  a guy, Kevin Clancy, has been with us forever. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3376.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3378.68s)]
*  Like that's a stupid idea. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3379.52s)]
*  Podcasts, you'll never make money doing that, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3380.3999999999996s)]
*  but they fucking did it. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3382.3199999999997s)]
*  Obviously they were smarter than me. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3384.04s)]
*  Caller Daddy, that came from us. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3385.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3387.2s)]
*  Alice Cooper. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3388.04s)]
*  So yeah, we've had a lot of big successful people [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3388.88s)]
*  that really were, I mean, McAfee played in the NFL, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3393.6s)]
*  but no one knew him on the media side. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3396.2799999999997s)]
*  A lot of big people that Million Dollars Worth a Game [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3397.72s)]
*  is a huge like urban podcast with us right now. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3400.36s)]
*  So yeah, we've had a lot of big successes. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3403.7999999999997s)]
*  Was there someone that you, can you turn the heat on? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  Get a little chilly out. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3410.48s)]
*  I broke out my scarf game for that. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3411.6s)]
*  I want to become a scarf guy. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3413.3199999999997s)]
*  I want to become a scarf guy, yeah. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3414.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3415.7999999999997s)]
*  Ooh, that's a move, I feel like. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3416.64s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3419.64s)]
*  This is the first time kind of debuting going with it, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3420.84s)]
*  but I was taking off in the car, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3423.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, you know what, I'm gonna try to maybe [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3425.96s)]
*  get into the scarf phase of my life. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3427.7599999999998s)]
*  There is something nice, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3429.72s)]
*  it feels like it, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3430.56s)]
*  only if you feel a little bit regal [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3431.4s)]
*  or you feel like at least they'll let you [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3433.0s)]
*  in a department store, I feel like. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3434.84s)]
*  And I'm starting to get like fat, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3436.52s)]
*  it kind of like covers the walls. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3438.04s)]
*  That's how you say that on a video the other day, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3439.88s)]
*  you were saying how like. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3441.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm starting to put on weight. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3442.2s)]
*  It comes with the age, so it's like I've been [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3443.8s)]
*  doing the pizza thing forever. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3446.0s)]
*  My shoulders all fucked, so yeah, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3448.28s)]
*  I think it's just, you know, life. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3450.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3451.8s)]
*  Was there a hire or a fire or something? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3454.1200000000003s)]
*  Because, oh, I wanted to say this, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3458.88s)]
*  yeah, Caleb, whenever I got to know Caleb, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3459.92s)]
*  one thing he raves about is that he loves working for you. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3462.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's been great, I think. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3465.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he genuinely, like, you know what I'm saying, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3467.32s)]
*  like some people say my job, but he has, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3469.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he absolutely loves it. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3471.96s)]
*  Working for Barstow. I think there's two things for him [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3474.48s)]
*  that probably he likes working for us, me, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3476.2000000000003s)]
*  is the freedom, which I just said, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3479.48s)]
*  and I always do what I say. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3481.44s)]
*  So I have the back of the talent as much as I can always, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3483.2400000000002s)]
*  but like if I say something, it's his bond. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3488.04s)]
*  I actually think in his contract, he has something, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3492.2000000000003s)]
*  like when Penn bought us, he's like, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3495.2400000000002s)]
*  if there's a disagreement between Penn and me [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3498.0s)]
*  or something, like Dave gets to make the final decision. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3502.6000000000004s)]
*  He just trusts that, it's good to work for somebody [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3504.6800000000003s)]
*  where you know you can trust, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3508.6400000000003s)]
*  like they have your best interests, and I do. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3510.7200000000003s)]
*  And some people may not like what I say or do, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3512.76s)]
*  but I'm pretty straightforward, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3515.84s)]
*  and the track record is like there. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3517.36s)]
*  Like 20 years, I've been pretty consistently [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3518.96s)]
*  straightforward, honest, truthful. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3522.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3524.0400000000004s)]
*  Is there a hire or a departure that you regret, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3525.28s)]
*  or that you, like somebody that you let go or anything, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3528.1600000000003s)]
*  or did you have any? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3530.8s)]
*  No, I mean, we hired Mike Rappaport. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3531.8s)]
*  This is a big fucking, I don't like that guy right now. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3534.6400000000003s)]
*  He doesn't like me. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3537.7200000000003s)]
*  He doesn't like me. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3538.7200000000003s)]
*  That was a debacle. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3539.5600000000004s)]
*  I literally, if I throw a punch, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3541.1600000000003s)]
*  I've never been in a fight in my life, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3544.52s)]
*  never thrown a punch in anger. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3545.5600000000004s)]
*  If I threw a punch right now with my left arm, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3546.92s)]
*  it would dislocate. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3548.5600000000004s)]
*  That's how fucked up my shoulders are. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3549.4s)]
*  He got me so mad, I sent him a contract to fight him. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3551.2000000000003s)]
*  Like that's how fucking, that ended terribly. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3554.0s)]
*  The McAfee thing with us didn't end great, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3557.6s)]
*  but like I don't really have regrets. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3560.88s)]
*  He was always gonna be like a huge star on his own. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3563.2799999999997s)]
*  He's so good at so many things. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3565.72s)]
*  So no, not too much. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3567.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3570.68s)]
*  I mean, we've become to a degree, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3571.52s)]
*  and I always said a Saturday Night Live model, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3574.44s)]
*  like we bring unknown talent and try to make them stars, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3576.6s)]
*  and we'll keep them as long as we can keep them. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3580.6s)]
*  But really, if we can't, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3583.52s)]
*  hopefully they go become big somewhere else, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3585.56s)]
*  and it adds more credibility for us. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3588.08s)]
*  Because then people are like, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3590.2799999999997s)]
*  oh, this is a place where I can get a start [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3591.12s)]
*  and build my name and either stay with Barstool or not. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3593.96s)]
*  We've been pretty good at that. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3596.7999999999997s)]
*  Like we got a girl now, Brianna Chickenfry. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3597.84s)]

*  Chicken fries? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3614.04s)]

*  Oh, it's not a last name. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3616.08s)]
*  No, no, that was her, when we hired her, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3616.92s)]
*  she already had like Brianna Chickenfries [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3619.0s)]
*  was her TikTok user handle. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3621.32s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3622.76s)]
*  Because I think she liked chicken fries. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3623.6s)]
*  Because she likes eating late at night. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3624.84s)]
*  What's that? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3626.88s)]
*  She likes eating late at night, probably. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3627.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, chicken fry, yeah. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3628.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3629.56s)]
*  Oh, I was wondering, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3631.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought maybe she was like Cherokee or like. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3632.08s)]
*  Imagine that. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3633.4s)]
*  Be like your Native American name, Chickenfry. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3634.2400000000002s)]
*  That would be fucking fire. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3637.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3638.92s)]
*  Yeah, I almost knocked up this Native American girl one time. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3640.2400000000002s)]
*  So I met this girl in a motel, right? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3643.92s)]
*  So. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3646.88s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3648.12s)]
*  Like, is there like, does two motels have like, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3649.64s)]
*  motel bars? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3654.2000000000003s)]
*  Or like you just started walking around? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3655.16s)]
*  Oh, no, no, this girl, we met on social media, right? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3656.8s)]
*  Got it. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3660.04s)]
*  And this was probably yesterday, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3660.88s)]
*  I might've even been. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3661.84s)]
*  Oh, it was an intentional meetup. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3662.68s)]
*  Yeah, so she drove, I think like 10 or 11 hours too. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3664.6s)]
*  And she drove from like. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3667.96s)]
*  She was. The red flag. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3668.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3670.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3671.44s)]
*  And she was a Native American. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3672.5600000000004s)]
*  And so she drove in and she, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3674.88s)]
*  and we ended up making love or whatever. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3678.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't remember exactly what happened. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3681.1200000000003s)]
*  But then on the drive home, I guess she got kind of bored [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3682.2000000000003s)]
*  and she starts saying, well, if I'm pregnant, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3685.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna keep this child. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3687.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3688.6000000000004s)]
*  And now I'm like, Jesus Christ. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3689.44s)]
*  Right after, yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3690.28s)]
*  Although to her defense, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3691.1200000000003s)]
*  you probably do have a lot of time to think [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3692.88s)]
*  on a 10 hour drive. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3695.36s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3696.52s)]
*  That's actually. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3698.1600000000003s)]
*  A lot of things go through your mind. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3699.0s)]
*  Yeah, I should have given her at least five hours [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3700.1600000000003s)]
*  to be hypothetically pregnant on that drive. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3702.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3703.7599999999998s)]
*  Like a 10 hour drive, you're thinking a lot of shit. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3704.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3707.92s)]
*  Yeah, especially when you're just driving back [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3708.96s)]
*  to the res or whatever. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3710.24s)]
*  And as you just get back there [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3711.36s)]
*  and there's a bunch of free gasoline from the government [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3712.2s)]
*  and you're like, what the fuck am I gonna do [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3714.44s)]
*  with this family, you know, if I have a family? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3715.84s)]
*  But anyway, she got intense and God, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3718.0s)]
*  that made me so nervous. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3720.2799999999997s)]
*  Did you, cause you got into a relationship. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3723.04s)]
*  You are. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3726.16s)]
*  I was married. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3727.16s)]
*  I'm in a relationship now. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3728.04s)]
*  Okay, in a relationship now. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3729.24s)]
*  And was it, did you, were you looking for a relationship [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3730.52s)]
*  or did it just kind of happen? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3733.16s)]
*  Which one? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3734.16s)]
*  My current girlfriend? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3735.32s)]
*  Current girlfriend. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3736.16s)]
*  No, no. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3737.0s)]
*  So like my ex-wife, basically I met when I started Barstool [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3738.8s)]
*  right about the same time. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3744.08s)]
*  And I'm still like best friends with her. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3745.44s)]
*  She's the best. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3746.72s)]
*  And then I was single for a while, probably [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3748.04s)]
*  living a crazier lifestyle, I would say. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3752.28s)]
*  Like it was a totally different time [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3754.88s)]
*  because Barstool was nothing. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3756.88s)]
*  And to it, obviously, like being well known, fame, money [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3760.2000000000003s)]
*  brings more women and opportunities in your life. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3764.5600000000004s)]
*  So I've seen you fucking on Twitter a little. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3767.6800000000003s)]
*  At some point I had seen something, you know. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3769.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, no. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3771.1600000000003s)]
*  I didn't watch all of it. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3772.0s)]
*  There's some stuff out there that, you know. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3772.84s)]
*  Good for you, man. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3775.84s)]
*  I get embarrassed. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3777.52s)]
*  Like if I'm, I even walk out of the room backwards [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3778.44s)]
*  cause I don't want women seeing my butt and stuff. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3780.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I was a big video guy. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3782.8s)]
*  Like I, that probably, and back in time, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3784.7200000000003s)]
*  it's like who the fuck would ever wanna watch me fuck. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3788.12s)]
*  So, but so, I don't know, five years single [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3790.04s)]
*  and then just met her. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3794.6s)]
*  Silvana is her name. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3796.56s)]
*  It was pretty organic. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3797.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3799.04s)]
*  And is it kind of less stressful? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3799.88s)]
*  Cause I've started to find that like, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3801.72s)]
*  like as you start, you don't wanna just like [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3804.12s)]
*  hook up with strangers. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3806.2799999999997s)]
*  It gets a little bit like scary kind of like, you know. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3807.52s)]
*  It's like, I don't want a child, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3810.48s)]
*  like even a possible child somewhere. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3813.68s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3817.2s)]
*  I was pretty free and loose. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3818.04s)]
*  I would never like in hindsight, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3821.48s)]
*  I was probably a fucking idiot [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3824.56s)]
*  because there's a lot of, a lot of post shit [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3825.96s)]
*  that I've dealt with that a lot of people know about me. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3829.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, hit pieces written about me [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3832.64s)]
*  about my sexual activities, sex, I've had it all, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3835.16s)]
*  which I never would have guessed for like fucking me. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3837.52s)]
*  Like that, if someone back in high school is like, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3840.04s)]
*  wait till you fucking see what this guy's gonna turn out [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3842.56s)]
*  to be like, I would have never fucking guessed it. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3845.8s)]
*  So yeah, I was probably playing fast and loose [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3849.6800000000003s)]
*  is how I would describe it, but whatever. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3853.2000000000003s)]
*  It's been a wild ride, I'll say that. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3855.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's been exciting, man. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3858.32s)]
*  I think it seems like it's really been exciting. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3860.0s)]
*  Do you feel like a pressure, like I feel a pressure [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3862.2400000000002s)]
*  as I get older to try and stay like younger and stuff? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3863.96s)]
*  Does that feel hard for you? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3866.04s)]
*  Does it feel? No, no. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3867.04s)]
*  I feel like it's been a fairly natural thing. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3868.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, so I probably crammed so much into that five years [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3871.92s)]
*  of being single, like I never went to clubs really ever. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3877.1200000000003s)]
*  And then I started going out a lot. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3880.6800000000003s)]
*  And you know, I went from the guy who's like [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3882.2000000000003s)]
*  with his buddies, if you're trying to save up to go out once, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3886.1200000000003s)]
*  like how the fuck am I gonna afford this table? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3888.44s)]
*  Only fucking losers would pay for that table. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3890.7200000000003s)]
*  All the hot girls are there, but it's like, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3893.4s)]
*  I can't fucking afford this to, you know, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3894.88s)]
*  you're getting opportunities. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3896.88s)]
*  Like I remember I was just saying on the way over, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3897.96s)]
*  like Super Bowl is coming up [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3899.8s)]
*  and I'm getting every invite in the book, like, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3901.08s)]
*  hey, come to this party, we have a table here, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3902.84s)]
*  a table there. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3904.56s)]
*  And I sent it to this guy, Paul Gass, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3905.6s)]
*  who's been employed basically number one, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3907.7599999999998s)]
*  worked at my kitchen table. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3910.32s)]
*  We went to a Super Bowl party [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3911.72s)]
*  and we had to pay 25 grand for a table. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3913.2799999999997s)]
*  For us, that's like, do we have it, credit card, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3915.56s)]
*  can we do it? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3917.88s)]
*  And they fucking put us in a satellite room. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3918.72s)]
*  We weren't even in the room [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3920.7599999999998s)]
*  where the fucking party was happening. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3922.48s)]
*  We were watching the party on a TV. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3924.12s)]
*  And I just, I sent him the link. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3926.8s)]
*  I'm like, man, times have changed. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3928.52s)]
*  We're getting, but so I did that phase. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3929.92s)]
*  I mean, I was doing drugs, I was going out all the time. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3932.56s)]
*  It was just like a very different phase of my life. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3935.7200000000003s)]
*  Now, I really don't like being in clubs at all. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3938.8s)]
*  Like, Silvana, my girlfriend still loves it, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3941.7200000000003s)]
*  but I've toned it. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  I've gotten her to be like, listen, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3945.76s)]
*  I don't wanna be there. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3947.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, it's not where I wanna be. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3948.4s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3949.36s)]
*  I actually do feel old in those situations. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3950.4s)]
*  The first time in my life, I look around like, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3953.12s)]
*  damn, I'm a fucking old guy in here. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3954.88s)]
*  So that part of my life, I think, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3957.12s)]
*  is pretty much in the rear view. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3959.24s)]
*  Like Super Bowl, yeah, I'll go out. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3961.2799999999997s)]
*  But I mean, I was going out, fuck, four or five days a week. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3962.72s)]
*  Pretty heavy, pretty heavy. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3968.48s)]
*  And were you partying, could you party pretty hard or not? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3971.12s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3973.72s)]
*  I never used to, but I was. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3974.56s)]
*  Were y'all doing drugs too, cocaine? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3977.72s)]
*  I'm not a big coke guy. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3979.64s)]
*  People always think I'm a coke guy. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3980.68s)]
*  I'm pretty honest about what's- [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3982.24s)]
*  I think it's the hair probably. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3984.56s)]
*  Does it look like hair? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3987.12s)]
*  Oh, the hair looks like I'll find a gram in it, son. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3988.68s)]
*  Yeah, like that, like a Wall Street guy. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3990.7999999999997s)]
*  Like a slick back guy. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3992.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it looks like a- [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3994.84s)]
*  Yeah, like a wet hair. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3995.68s)]
*  Like a wet hair. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3996.52s)]
*  And maybe now, especially since you live in Florida, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3997.36s)]
*  maybe that adds to it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=3998.84s)]
*  Like you think like, oh, this guy. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4000.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, I was doing a lot. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4001.64s)]
*  Adderall would be like, I do a lot just to even wake up work. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4003.24s)]
*  I think ecstasy is the best drug there is. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4007.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, I never get depressed on it. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4009.56s)]
*  But no, I was never big on coke. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4012.84s)]
*  But like for me to be out, I don't know how people- [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4014.28s)]
*  I mean, Miami doesn't fucking close. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4017.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, Miami's insane, man. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4020.1200000000003s)]

*  Even the trees, man. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4023.1600000000003s)]
*  You'll walk by two trees, it'll be fucking 4AM. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4024.32s)]
*  It literally like is. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4026.6400000000003s)]
*  Like you walk out of 11 and there's a fucking line at 9AM. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4027.96s)]
*  It's just, I don't even know what people do there. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4032.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4034.28s)]

*  And people don't start going out. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4036.84s)]
*  It's like, hey, you want to go out at 11? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4038.0800000000004s)]

*  was happening, I wanted to save my case, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4339.76s)]

*  It's like with the little, the lights, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4362.4s)]
*  and it went by quick. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4364.96s)]
*  My main thing, honestly, because I know he goes so long, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4366.4s)]
*  it's like if I go two hours, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4369.72s)]
*  that probably means he fucking didn't like me [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4371.28s)]
*  and like I'm out. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4373.28s)]
*  So once it ended, I'm like, how long was it? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4374.12s)]
*  But it was cool and it's so big, you know, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4376.4800000000005s)]

*  because we're soaring in the business, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4381.04s)]
*  but even still, like after we did it, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4382.52s)]
*  so many people just walking out the street, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4385.0s)]
*  he's like, oh, listen to Rogan, show the phone. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4386.72s)]
*  I mean, his reach is just crazy. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4388.76s)]
*  He's probably the most influential guy in media there is. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4389.96s)]
*  I think so. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4393.8s)]
*  I think it's been like that for a while. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4394.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4396.08s)]
*  You know, I think, and especially people didn't realize [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4396.92s)]
*  that until he got that big contract, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4398.96s)]
*  that almost kind of, I mean, it was amazing for him [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4400.6s)]
*  and he deserves it, but when they put out that article [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4403.12s)]
*  that he made like a hundred million a year or something, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4406.12s)]
*  and I think it was twice that, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4408.240000000001s)]
*  but that's when everybody, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4409.6s)]
*  like that's when people started attacking him, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4412.08s)]
*  that's when he saw all these hit pieces. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4413.64s)]
*  It's like, it's just, it's so dangerous kind of like, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4415.16s)]
*  I don't know, the media is just so scary. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4421.04s)]
*  It's like, they can shape anything any way they want. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4423.8s)]
*  And I, he's definitely perceived as a threat [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4427.04s)]
*  because he uses escape velocity, whatever, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4432.8s)]
*  but you can't control, if you can't control [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4436.88s)]
*  how somebody thinks and you really can't hurt them, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4440.36s)]
*  that is a threat. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4444.96s)]
*  I think the attacks come and why they came, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4446.400000000001s)]
*  because what's the point really of going after him [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4449.360000000001s)]
*  when he's a solo guy? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4451.72s)]
*  You don't give a fuck. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4452.92s)]
*  When you have Spotify, there's a thought [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4454.240000000001s)]
*  I can get to him now, right? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4457.280000000001s)]
*  Because Spotify, now Spotify- [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4458.68s)]
*  Oh, it's like with PIN. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4460.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Spotify backed him up, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4460.92s)]
*  but I mean, he did have to delete episodes [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4463.160000000001s)]
*  and maybe say things that ordinarily if it was by himself, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4466.120000000001s)]
*  maybe would have, maybe he wouldn't have, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4468.92s)]
*  but I think that is, that's the switch. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4470.84s)]
*  It's like, aha, he kind of has the answer to somebody now, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4472.88s)]
*  whether he actually does or he doesn't, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4475.76s)]
*  but somebody signed in his checks before nobody is. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4477.64s)]
*  So what's the point of going at, what is that gonna do? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4480.36s)]
*  Because you may just actually ignite more [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4482.68s)]
*  because he doesn't give a fuck. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4485.96s)]
*  His audience is his audience. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4487.04s)]
*  That would be to me the difference [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4488.8s)]
*  and why it happened when he did that. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4490.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4492.36s)]
*  Yeah, I remember when I first went in, dude, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4495.08s)]
*  I was sitting there, I got a tweet, a DM from him [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4496.88s)]
*  in the middle, like, and just like 11 p.m. or something, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4499.8s)]
*  but I was going to bed early, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4502.28s)]
*  so it was like middle of the night, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4503.44s)]
*  but and it was like, hey, do you wanna call my show? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4504.28s)]
*  And I remember being like, oh my God. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4507.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was excited too when I got it. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4509.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if you, people always hit me up like, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4510.679999999999s)]
*  hey, can you have me get on or sit? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4512.679999999999s)]
*  And it's like, there's no real way to get on. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4514.2s)]
*  Like Joe, like will literally hit people up. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4516.16s)]
*  That's exactly how it did with me. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4518.719999999999s)]
*  And that's how he does it. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4519.5599999999995s)]
*  It was mine, so the New York Times [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4520.48s)]
*  wrote basically a hit piece on me [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4523.32s)]
*  and they were working on it for a year, I knew about it. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4525.5599999999995s)]
*  They dug through my entire fucking past. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4528.639999999999s)]
*  It's so trash. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4530.76s)]
*  Dude, that fricking rag is trash. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4531.6s)]
*  Every single person that I was friends with [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4533.4400000000005s)]
*  in my network, they're reaching, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4537.320000000001s)]
*  girls call me like, that I didn't even know, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4539.160000000001s)]
*  or send me DMs being like, what is this about? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4541.08s)]
*  A year long, they really found nothing [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4544.72s)]
*  and it turned into just like, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4546.400000000001s)]
*  like I'm a scumbag gambling hit piece. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4547.8s)]
*  The point of the story, the reporter wrote in the article, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4549.88s)]
*  like we reached out to Dave for comment, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4553.88s)]
*  he didn't reach back. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4555.84s)]
*  And I posted my exchanges with this woman [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4557.16s)]
*  and they went back, I think seven months, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4561.4s)]
*  where I'm like, hey, I know you're digging into my past. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4563.16s)]
*  I will sit down, meet with you. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4565.92s)]
*  We both get to record. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4567.16s)]
*  You can ask me anything. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4568.16s)]
*  I'll answer anything you want. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4569.44s)]
*  I'm right here. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4570.96s)]
*  She kept responding, I'm eager to meet, soon, soon. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4571.88s)]
*  This went on for months of her being like, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4574.4s)]
*  I'm eager to meet with you. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4576.44s)]
*  I'll talk to you soon. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4577.68s)]
*  Ghost for like five, six. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4579.08s)]
*  Articles, she writes the whole article. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4581.92s)]
*  She's like, you have 48 hours to respond [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4583.32s)]
*  to a million bullet points. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4585.6s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck that. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4587.4800000000005s)]
*  I was like, I gave you the opportunity [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4588.4800000000005s)]
*  and I posted the exchange. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4590.240000000001s)]
*  Rogan saw that and he's like, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4591.68s)]
*  the New York Times, it's the worst. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4593.72s)]
*  And that prompted it. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4595.4800000000005s)]
*  And actually, I have my phone. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4596.84s)]
*  So I, she never, this is the reporter never responded. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4599.240000000001s)]
*  I wrote, her name is Emily Steele, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4603.6s)]
*  this lady who wrote the article on me. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4605.320000000001s)]
*  This is Friday, January 13th. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4607.280000000001s)]
*  I just tweeted a thank you for the hit piece [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4609.56s)]
*  you wrote on me. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4611.4400000000005s)]
*  It's what landed me on Rogan [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4612.280000000001s)]
*  and introduced a brand new audience to me. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4613.72s)]
*  Thank you for being a hater. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4615.72s)]
*  It actually made my brand stronger than ever. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4617.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4619.16s)]
*  So I just sent her that little fuck you. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4620.0s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4621.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they fucking do that shit, man. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4622.280000000001s)]
*  They do that shit. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4624.4800000000005s)]
*  They sneak around. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4625.320000000001s)]
*  People call somebody, call your old employer. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4626.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4629.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's like, I've always said, hey, I'm here. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4630.320000000001s)]
*  Like I'm saying, I'll sit down. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4632.4800000000005s)]
*  You can ask me fucking anything and record it [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4634.320000000001s)]
*  as long as I can too. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4636.400000000001s)]
*  If you're trying to do a fair, and what's crazy, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4638.240000000001s)]
*  like I grew up in my brain. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4641.6s)]
*  Like the New York Times is like legit. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4644.400000000001s)]
*  That is what I thought of the New York Times. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4645.72s)]
*  So I always look at that, unless you're in this fucking world [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4647.84s)]
*  and you're like part of it, like even my dad, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4652.400000000001s)]
*  who's a liberal, hates fucking Trump, that type of guy, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4655.0s)]
*  like he still has a hard time being like, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4658.080000000001s)]
*  yeah, the New York Times is biased. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4659.84s)]
*  Like he almost has it because he's seen it, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4661.4400000000005s)]
*  but it is scary because if you're not in it, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4663.4800000000005s)]
*  you just believe like most normal people [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4666.84s)]
*  aren't gonna do the back research on a hit piece. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4669.360000000001s)]
*  They're gonna be like, oh, that's true. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4671.56s)]
*  So that part of it is fucking scary. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4672.88s)]
*  Well, it's even like even headlines and anything. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4675.6s)]
*  If somebody writes like Larry's gay [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4677.72s)]
*  and you see that as the headline, you'd be like, damn dude. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4679.32s)]
*  Right, because more- Larry's gay. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4681.400000000001s)]
*  Did you hear Larry's gay? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4682.84s)]
*  Yeah, Larry's fucking gay. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4683.96s)]
*  And they didn't even look at who it is, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4685.28s)]
*  if it's Lawrence or who it is. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4688.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, that is- [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4690.8s)]
*  Nobody, it's just like, and then it's like, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4692.76s)]
*  and there's never any apology. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4695.12s)]
*  That's the weirdest thing. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4696.56s)]
*  Like there's never any like recuperate or any- [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4697.72s)]
*  So Business Insider, who I fucking hate, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4703.12s)]
*  wrote a hit piece on me and it was vicious. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4705.0s)]
*  Basically made me sound like a rapist. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4707.56s)]
*  And like within 24 hours, I had all the receipts. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4709.52s)]
*  Like, thank God of like, well, here's all the proof [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4714.2s)]
*  that this is totally fucking bullshit. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4718.64s)]
*  I was, I guess naive at the time, like, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4720.84s)]
*  oh, they're gonna retract it, say apology. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4723.400000000001s)]
*  They said, they wrote another article [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4725.52s)]
*  and my lawyer was like, well, they can now say it's news. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4728.08s)]
*  It's like, well, it's only news because they fucking wrote it, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4731.92s)]
*  but it becomes news. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4735.04s)]
*  It's like, what kind of fucked up game is this? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4736.28s)]
*  It's news now? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4739.56s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4740.88s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4741.96s)]
*  I went all the way, fucking sued their asses. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4742.92s)]
*  And it just, the judge came back, they're like, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4745.12s)]
*  there's no way being bad at your job [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4748.12s)]
*  isn't an excuse to like sue. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4751.88s)]
*  It's almost like Johnny Depp. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4753.84s)]
*  Johnny Depp, when he sued, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4754.96s)]
*  he originally sued the newspaper and lost [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4756.6s)]
*  because the newspaper can always be like, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4759.36s)]
*  well, we didn't know that she wasn't telling the truth [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4761.04s)]
*  or we didn't look at any of the other evidence. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4763.12s)]
*  You have to sue the actual, like he sued Amber Heard. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4765.72s)]
*  So the whole thing's fucked. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4768.36s)]
*  I know, huh? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4770.08s)]
*  Makes me really jaded. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4770.92s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4772.16s)]
*  This shit makes everybody mad. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4773.28s)]
*  I think, cause you start to feel like [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4775.08s)]
*  there's no way to win against this thing. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4776.36s)]
*  And whatever this thing is, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4779.28s)]
*  but it starts to feel like there's something [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4781.2s)]
*  that you can't, you know. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4782.8s)]
*  The only way I look at it, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4784.12s)]
*  people fucking hate me or always gonna hate me. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4786.08s)]
*  I could cure cancer, they'd be like, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4789.0s)]
*  why didn't you do it faster? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4790.36s)]
*  Now the flip side, the people like me and love me [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4791.719999999999s)]
*  are always gonna love me. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4794.08s)]
*  And I've said before, what's great. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4794.92s)]
*  Now I tell the truth, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4796.88s)]
*  but my crowd is so kind of like in my corner, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4798.679999999999s)]
*  and I wasn't, but if I wasn't telling the truth, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4803.4s)]
*  they'd probably still believe me. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4806.28s)]
*  It's like, it's almost, they're on my side [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4807.48s)]
*  and the people aren't. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4810.2s)]
*  Now I, good for the people like me. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4811.599999999999s)]
*  I do tell the truth and it's always honest, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4813.5199999999995s)]
*  but it's so hard to convince. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4815.08s)]
*  Once people have their minds set up or made up, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4817.24s)]
*  it's hard to get them off that point. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4821.0s)]
*  They just ignore like facts. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4823.639999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4824.48s)]
*  Yeah, people wanna be blind to facts. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4825.32s)]
*  That's kind of bizarre. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4826.24s)]
*  But then sometimes I wonder how much do I fall [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4827.5599999999995s)]
*  into the same trap even myself, you know. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4829.36s)]
*  It's like, I sometimes wonder that. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4831.2s)]
*  We saw this thing like Buzzfeed was starting to use like AI [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4835.8s)]
*  to generate articles. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4839.08s)]
*  Do you see that? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4840.12s)]
*  Yeah, stock went up like a bazillion percent because of it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4840.96s)]
*  But do you like, cause you have like real, you know, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4843.599999999999s)]
*  employees with alcoholism and whatever else. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4846.68s)]
*  Yeah, we got the real deal people. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4849.92s)]
*  Yeah, you guys got the fucking guy, you know, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4850.76s)]
*  he's right there, you know, some guy who's, you know, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4852.4800000000005s)]
*  gonna overdose or his wife's gonna leave him [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4855.8s)]
*  because he's writing another article for you. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4857.96s)]
*  You know, it's like, you got, but you got real people. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4859.72s)]
*  We got real people. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4862.04s)]
*  Yeah, you got real people with fucking asthma, you know, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4862.88s)]
*  like fucking real motherfuckers. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4865.120000000001s)]
*  Does this kind of shit scare you or do you think [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4867.72s)]
*  this is cheap or do you think anything about it? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4869.52s)]
*  It's a business. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4871.52s)]
*  I mean, I feel like Buzzfeed has always been [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4872.360000000001s)]
*  the lowest common denominator for talent. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4875.88s)]
*  So it doesn't surprise me. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4877.72s)]
*  Nothing will ever, for our business, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4879.08s)]
*  we look for weird, talented people. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4881.5199999999995s)]
*  There's no AI or anything like that who can, you know, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4883.64s)]
*  reply, well, I hate glenny balls, but no, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4886.76s)]
*  this isn't our world. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4889.76s)]
*  It doesn't scare me. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4892.32s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4893.28s)]
*  Yeah, cause it says Buzzfeed's using AI to write [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4895.5199999999995s)]
*  its articles after firing 180 employees. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4897.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they're talking about their like listicles and shit. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4900.04s)]
*  So they're just aggregating. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4903.0s)]
*  I feel bad for the people who got fired too, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4904.68s)]
*  but I wouldn't say those people were like [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4906.8s)]
*  the pinnacle of like talent, you know? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4909.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4911.92s)]
*  So it- [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4912.92s)]
*  Yeah, no Thoreau's, no Walden. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4913.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're coming up with like, you know, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4915.0s)]
*  I don't know, the 10 things you should fucking be doing [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4917.84s)]
*  when you like come home after your grocery. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4921.12s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck it was. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4923.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 10 things you do when your cat dies or something. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4924.08s)]
*  Yeah, right, yeah. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4925.92s)]
*  So they're just aggregating it. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4926.84s)]
*  Again, I do feel bad for the employees, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4928.56s)]
*  but this isn't, I wouldn't view Buzzfeed [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4932.4800000000005s)]
*  as like my world necessarily. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4935.84s)]
*  We really are looking for like talented people or weirdos. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4938.04s)]
*  Yeah, me and Caleb wanted to try and do a show, you know? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4943.48s)]
*  It would be fun. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4946.56s)]
*  I like spending time with him. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4947.84s)]
*  I would say the bigger threat, if you wanna call it, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4950.96s)]
*  to my world, our world, is the evolution of like technology. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4954.76s)]
*  Let's take you, for example. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4959.36s)]
*  There's probably a world back when we started [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4962.32s)]
*  where you wouldn't have nearly the vehicles [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4965.84s)]
*  to get your name out there without like coming to us, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4969.84s)]
*  you know, or somebody or a TikToker. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4972.16s)]
*  Like TikToker doesn't exist. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4975.04s)]
*  So if you're a talented person, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4976.32s)]
*  how do you get your content out there? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4977.68s)]
*  It's far fewer places. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4979.400000000001s)]
*  So that's the harder thing because, you know, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4981.4800000000005s)]
*  we really have to find the talent early, early, early, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4984.16s)]
*  because once someone's pretty established on social media [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4988.76s)]
*  or through their platforms, they don't need us at all. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4991.92s)]
*  So that's the harder thing with- [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4995.04s)]
*  Do you have somebody looking for that kind of thing? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4996.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're always looking for talent. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4998.48s)]
*  Really? Always. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=4999.68s)]
*  Now when you say always looking, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5000.5199999999995s)]
*  but you have like an employee that's actively kind of- [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5001.6s)]
*  No, we don't. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5003.92s)]
*  Right. So I guess not. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5004.76s)]
*  We're always willing to hire talent if we find it. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5006.4s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5008.32s)]
*  But it is hard. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5009.16s)]
*  You gotta get them super early. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5010.6s)]
*  And our value prop on that early is basically, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5011.76s)]
*  we'll be like gasoline. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5015.04s)]
*  We'll accelerate you. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5016.0s)]
*  You sign, you know, generally like a two, three year contract. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5016.92s)]
*  And if you're good, being in our network [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5020.96s)]
*  should really like give you maybe a way to cut the line, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5024.56s)]
*  so to speak, to get your name out there. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5028.120000000001s)]
*  Then you can reevaluate. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5030.04s)]
*  Do you want to stay with us? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5031.200000000001s)]
*  You want to do it on your own? That type of thing. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5032.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5033.360000000001s)]
*  What do you think, anything about like this GP, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5035.280000000001s)]
*  this GP chat thing, that thing that can make all its own [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5037.200000000001s)]
*  articles and stuff, it can write papers, you know? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5039.52s)]
*  Is that, what's the difference between that [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5041.68s)]
*  and the listicle shit? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5043.4400000000005s)]
*  Chat GPT can be like, hey, will you write me a paper? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5044.64s)]
*  You know, it's a, Dave Portnoy writes a paper on [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5050.8s)]
*  young men trying to meet each other in the 17th century, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5054.64s)]
*  right? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5058.4800000000005s)]
*  At night. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5059.320000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5060.160000000001s)]
*  And you put that information in there, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5061.0s)]
*  and then it'll do like a three page paper [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5062.6s)]
*  that would be in your voice. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5064.64s)]
*  Sounds like a good fucking way to like get through school. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5066.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5069.56s)]
*  I just wonder how weird that's going to get if every, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5071.0s)]
*  you know, like... [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5072.96s)]
*  The same questions, I mean, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5074.400000000001s)]
*  the same questions, I guess, it's like, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5076.92s)]
*  well, they're sourcing the information from somewhere. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5078.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, so who's facts, like, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5080.88s)]
*  how do you know where you're getting the information from? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5084.0s)]
*  What's real, what's not, what's biased? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5085.68s)]
*  That doesn't change that part of it. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5087.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5089.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5090.24s)]
*  Yeah, I guess in the end, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5091.08s)]
*  in the end, I think you're still gonna have to have [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5091.92s)]
*  real talent will prevail. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5093.72s)]
*  I think even with stuff like this, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5096.12s)]
*  hopefully most people are gonna see through like, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5097.6s)]
*  oh, this is just another bullshit article, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5099.36s)]
*  and it's not anything that even a human wrote. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5101.96s)]
*  I feel like you can see that stuff pretty easily [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5104.24s)]
*  on the internet, and if you're falling for that shit, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5105.8s)]
*  then you, you or something is wrong with you. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5107.84s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know what these things [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5111.44s)]
*  will be used for exactly, but I know in our world, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5115.0s)]
*  at least, a lot of what people like is because [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5118.839999999999s)]
*  they are attached to the personality. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5123.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5124.879999999999s)]
*  So like, if you switch the names on who, like you, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5125.719999999999s)]
*  it changes how people perceive it, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5128.879999999999s)]
*  because if it's Theo Vaughan wrote or did something, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5130.799999999999s)]
*  people know you, and they view it through that lens, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5134.679999999999s)]
*  and that affects their enjoyment or lack thereof. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5137.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5140.36s)]
*  Yeah, like when Frank left the Jags game early, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5141.679999999999s)]
*  that shit broke my, I was like, what is even going on? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5143.72s)]
*  But I found myself enveloped in his life. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5146.4s)]
*  I wanna know what's going on. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5148.24s)]
*  Why is he leaving early? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5149.36s)]
*  I didn't know why he was leaving early either. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5150.5599999999995s)]
*  It blew my, it's like, this is the best game. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5152.32s)]
*  He flew all the way. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5154.88s)]
*  You're talking to Bill's, Bill's Dolphins. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5156.36s)]
*  Yeah, Bill's Dolphins, sorry. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5158.599999999999s)]
*  When he left, when Frank left the Bill's Dolphins game early, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5160.28s)]
*  I just- [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5163.12s)]
*  That's the attitude of Barstool in full display. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5163.96s)]
*  He, I think, I was mad at first, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5166.24s)]
*  because like, why'd we fucking send him there, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5168.0s)]
*  if he can't stay? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5170.04s)]
*  By the way, you're never gonna make a six, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5171.52s)]
*  it's 6 p.m. flight. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5173.12s)]
*  The game is long, but like, the game's a one. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5174.8s)]
*  You're gonna be sitting in traffic, there's no chance. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5177.4800000000005s)]
*  So it was doomed from the beginning. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5179.4400000000005s)]
*  So like, this went through like 10 different things [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5181.08s)]
*  at Barstool, like people booked it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5183.76s)]
*  It's like, in what world, you can't, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5185.08s)]
*  it's a one o'clock game, you're never gonna make six. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5186.76s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5189.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's in that parking lot with his luggage. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5190.6s)]
*  I'm like, what is even going on? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5192.56s)]
*  And I think he really thought he had to leave. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5194.2s)]
*  It's like, what are you, like, of course, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5196.2s)]
*  you'll stay, stay the night and fly. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5197.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5199.52s)]
*  Tom Brady just retired. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5201.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5203.0s)]
*  Did you feel anything about that? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5204.32s)]
*  So he's, he's- [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5206.12s)]
*  Do you know Tom? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5207.32s)]
*  Very loosely. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5210.2s)]
*  But I have like a long history with him [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5211.6s)]
*  because of where I grew up, like- [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5215.32s)]
*  Of course. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5217.400000000001s)]
*  The good, the bad, the ugly. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5220.24s)]
*  Like, so he, first of all, he went to the same school [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5221.68s)]
*  as me, Michigan, so he's the same year. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5223.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. So- [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5225.04s)]
*  Oh, really, so you remember him from college. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5225.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so went to college with him, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5227.0s)]
*  and then he comes to the Pats, and I'm in Boston. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5228.64s)]
*  And in the Patriots' rise, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5231.240000000001s)]
*  really coincided with the Barstool rise. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5233.84s)]
*  So we're so closely linked together. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5235.88s)]
*  Everything since I've been involved with, like, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5238.92s)]
*  the cops twice with Brady. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5241.84s)]
*  Once in a negative fashion, once in, well, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5243.6s)]
*  cops involved is never good, but one anti-Brady, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5247.96s)]
*  I guess you could say, and one pro. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5251.400000000001s)]
*  Like, so he way back in the day, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5253.6s)]
*  he basically, Giselle was on the beach [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5256.88s)]
*  with their little kid, Ben, he was an infant, Ben Brady. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5261.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God, wow. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5264.799999999999s)]
*  And he was naked. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5265.799999999999s)]
*  Who was, Tom was? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5267.04s)]
*  No, Ben, the kid with Giselle on a beach, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5267.96s)]
*  myself, beach, Miami. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5270.44s)]
*  I'd be naked too if I was with her. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5271.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, keep in mind the kid's an infant, her son. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5272.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5275.799999999999s)]
*  So it's his son, tiny little kid, like the Gerber baby. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5276.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5280.32s)]
*  Huge dick, huge dick. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5281.28s)]
*  No way. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5282.639999999999s)]
*  For a little baby. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5283.48s)]
*  And you saw it, how far away were you? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5284.32s)]
*  No, it was a fucking paparazzi photo. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5285.56s)]
*  It was on the internet. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5288.04s)]
*  And I made- [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5289.56s)]
*  And you can see that wand on him, huh? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5290.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I made a joke that- [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5291.4800000000005s)]
*  Going deep, huh? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5294.52s)]
*  This was the height of the Peyton Manning, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5295.360000000001s)]
*  Tom Brady rivalry. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5298.200000000001s)]
*  So I wrote a blog in this one, a blog, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5300.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, check out the howitzer on Brady's baby. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5303.04s)]
*  And I wrote a sentence below, I go, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5305.4400000000005s)]
*  Peyton Manning could never have a kid [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5307.52s)]
*  with this big of a hog or something like this. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5309.080000000001s)]
*  World War III broke out. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5311.360000000001s)]
*  Dave's a pedophile, he's sexualizing kids. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5312.76s)]
*  And the kid was an infant. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5315.6s)]
*  Police knocked on my door in Boston, came in, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5316.5599999999995s)]
*  they're like, we're gonna make your life real fucking [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5319.2s)]
*  horrible if you don't take this down. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5321.0s)]
*  Like people were saying I should be beaten to death. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5322.8s)]
*  Oh, it's like Mystic River. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5325.12s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5326.92s)]
*  So that was way early. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5328.0s)]
*  And then fast forward, the Patriots exploded. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5331.0s)]
*  We end up going to jail defending Brady [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5333.8s)]
*  for when he got suspended by the NFL, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5336.64s)]
*  handcuffed ourselves to each other at NFL headquarters. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5338.84s)]
*  I've been dragged out of the Super Bowl in handcuffs. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5341.72s)]
*  Bob Kraft, the owner of the team, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5345.5599999999995s)]
*  when Brady came back with Tampa Bay, called me up. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5347.44s)]
*  He's like, I want you to be my guest [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5350.2s)]
*  for when Brady comes back. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5351.8s)]
*  So it's been the full circle. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5353.08s)]
*  And I have met him, I think a couple times. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5355.04s)]
*  So if I saw him, I'd be like, hey Tommy, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5359.08s)]
*  I'm like, hey Dave, how's it going? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5360.72s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5361.8s)]
*  But I don't know him like on a real personal level. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5362.64s)]
*  But yeah, it's their success [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5365.8s)]
*  and everything that happened to Patriots. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5369.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think Barstool probably is the same [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5372.6s)]
*  if that doesn't happen. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5375.52s)]
*  It put us in the headlines in a lot of different ways. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5376.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's just a weird, magical ride. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5379.72s)]
*  It really has been, it's been nuts. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5382.64s)]
*  It's really fascinating, man. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5385.240000000001s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5386.160000000001s)]
*  Just on getting to have that experience. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5387.6s)]
*  Cause life, to have the ups and downs, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5389.080000000001s)]
*  to have all of it, to really have so many experiences. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5391.360000000001s)]
*  And football's so big in this country [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5394.360000000001s)]
*  and the Super Bowl's so big. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5395.68s)]
*  And we became Barstool, the face of the Patriot fan. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5397.120000000001s)]
*  There's a game, they can probably pull it, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5402.36s)]
*  if you pull up like, a Goodell clown towel. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5404.68s)]
*  So Goodell, the commissioner in the league. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5407.8s)]
*  The first time he came back to Gillette [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5409.68s)]
*  after all the controversy, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5412.76s)]
*  we printed like 70,000 of these towels [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5414.4s)]
*  with his face and a nose. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5417.12s)]
*  And we got, we're like, we need volunteers [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5418.84s)]
*  to hand these things out. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5422.24s)]
*  It was a big fucking thing. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5424.5599999999995s)]
*  Like if you, if you on the images for it, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5426.68s)]
*  you'll see like the whole fucking stadium, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5430.24s)]
*  basically, ooh, like go to the bottom right. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5432.88s)]
*  We had the shirts, so yeah. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5437.32s)]
*  Wow, there you are. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5439.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so like the whole fucking stadium. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5440.639999999999s)]
*  Goodell in there, it just, it was a wild time. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5442.92s)]
*  And we became, people just, they hated us [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5446.28s)]
*  because people hated the Patriots. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5449.28s)]
*  But that was your thing, you did it. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5450.8s)]
*  Barstool's in here, it's like this infection. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5452.4s)]
*  It's like this, yeah, it's almost like this plague, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5454.639999999999s)]
*  but it's not a negative plague. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5458.44s)]
*  It's like this disruptor. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5460.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the Patriots were the most talked about, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5462.12s)]
*  hated, loved, whatever team for like two decades. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5465.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5468.0s)]
*  And we were just right in the middle of it. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5468.84s)]
*  I remember Tony Collins was there, didn't he? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5470.0s)]
*  Was that Tony Collins? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5471.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're going way back. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5472.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5473.2s)]
*  Yeah, running back. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5474.04s)]
*  Yeah, I got to meet him one time. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5474.88s)]
*  He went to ECU, he was a cool cat, man. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5476.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5478.8s)]
*  I liked Tony Collins, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5479.64s)]
*  but I think he played in their Super Bowl game. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5480.4800000000005s)]
*  That would have been 85. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5481.8s)]
*  And they lost to the Bears maybe? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5483.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Wow. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5484.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yep. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5485.68s)]
*  That was when the Patriots, they were very good. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5487.0s)]
*  Steve Grogan was like my guy. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5489.0s)]
*  He was like, I loved him. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5490.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Patriots are for the most part, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5491.92s)]
*  terrible franchise up till the Brady era. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5494.400000000001s)]
*  They had two Super Bowls [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5496.68s)]
*  and the second one being the Parcells. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5498.280000000001s)]
*  But like Tech Mobile, did you ever play like... [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5499.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5502.8s)]
*  Like they're the worst team in Tech Mobile. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5503.64s)]
*  It's very sad. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5504.6s)]
*  I can't even remember. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5505.4400000000005s)]
*  They had a lot of, I think one of the running back [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5506.26s)]
*  was white, I think even. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5508.2s)]
*  Could have been, yeah, Craig James, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5510.0s)]
*  half of the Pony Express. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5512.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5513.320000000001s)]
*  Them and the Colts are the two worst teams in it. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5514.6s)]
*  Yeah, that was a lot. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5517.28s)]
*  What do you got for the Super Bowl, man? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5519.2s)]
*  Where are you landing at with it? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5520.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know, I'm back and forth. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5522.88s)]
*  I think right now, you gotta see if the Chiefs get healthy. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5524.76s)]
*  Their wide receivers are so banged up. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5527.5599999999995s)]
*  But if they get back, I think they get a pretty good shot. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5529.24s)]
*  I bet it'll be a good game, I think. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5532.8s)]
*  Right in out there. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5534.5199999999995s)]
*  So we have a bar in Scottsdale, which is cool. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5535.599999999999s)]
*  So- Oh, nice. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5538.2s)]
*  Yeah, we'll be doing like live radio there all week. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5539.04s)]
*  So we'll be there the whole time. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5541.32s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5542.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to see if I'm gonna get over there. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5543.76s)]
*  I expect to see it. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5545.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think we'll probably figure, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5547.36s)]
*  hopefully I'll figure something out. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5548.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like the Eagles, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5551.719999999999s)]
*  it just feels like there's some kind of weird [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5553.2s)]
*  Destiny thing going on there. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5554.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, they're just tearing people up. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5556.08s)]
*  I can't tell. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5557.48s)]
*  I mean, it's a game they beat San Fran, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5558.32s)]
*  no quarterback, like anybody could be. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5562.36s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen an NFL team, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5564.28s)]
*  they literally couldn't throw a forward pass. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5566.04s)]
*  So you're not gonna win many games that way. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5567.599999999999s)]
*  I think the Giants suck. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5569.759999999999s)]
*  The Eagles are the number one team, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5571.599999999999s)]
*  best team the whole time in the NFC. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5572.639999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know how good they are. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5576.08s)]
*  Right, yeah, that division, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5577.32s)]
*  there was so much disparity in the league this year [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5578.639999999999s)]
*  between good teams, there's so many bad teams. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5581.08s)]
*  Yeah, and I thought the AFC was overall better, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5583.28s)]
*  but I think the Eagles are very good. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5584.84s)]
*  I think it'll be a very good game. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5586.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think it's gonna be exciting. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5587.639999999999s)]
*  Have you seen this power slap and stuff? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5590.76s)]
*  Yes, it's crazy. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5592.84s)]
*  What do you mean by crazy? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5595.32s)]
*  Because people are getting... [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5596.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, their faces are getting deformed and shit. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5598.92s)]
*  Yeah, one guy's wife couldn't recognize him. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5601.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5603.88s)]
*  I saw the clip of the woman doing the somersault after. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5605.32s)]
*  Yeah, no, I see it, it's nuts. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5608.8s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5610.8s)]
*  But I mean, people love that shit. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5611.64s)]
*  It does remind me of early UFC. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5613.52s)]
*  Like early UFC, because if you go Google it, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5615.88s)]
*  a lot of hate out there online. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5619.68s)]
*  This is the worst thing that's ever fucking happened. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5621.28s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of people have opinions on Dana White, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5625.16s)]
*  his incident. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5628.28s)]
*  Oh, that was crazy that that happened [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5629.400000000001s)]
*  right when the league started. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5631.0s)]
*  I almost feel like I wonder if that was planned. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5632.32s)]
*  It's like unbelievable. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5634.04s)]
*  Because his wife's at least a lot, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5636.88s)]
*  she's probably banned him, wait, I don't know. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5638.48s)]
*  It's hard to see. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5640.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5641.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know what qualification it would be. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5643.5199999999995s)]
*  So if you Google it, there's a lot of hate. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5646.28s)]
*  But it's entertaining. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5648.5199999999995s)]
*  It's scary to watch. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5651.84s)]
*  But people are getting hurt. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5653.48s)]
*  One guy bought a van, right? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5654.32s)]
*  If you see that, the guy left the place [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5655.44s)]
*  and bought a van for no reason. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5656.96s)]
*  And he didn't even, there was no, like something. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5658.88s)]
*  So they're saying his brain got, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5662.8s)]
*  like his wires got crossed [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5664.360000000001s)]
*  and something's like you gotta buy a van? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5665.68s)]
*  Yeah, imagine just going, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5667.16s)]
*  first of all, imagine buying a van. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5668.08s)]
*  Yeah, van's kinda cool. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5669.6s)]
*  Yeah, kinda, but if you don't even need a van, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5671.56s)]
*  you're just like, hey, I'm getting a van. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5673.24s)]
*  Like you fucking come home from losing the fight with a van. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5674.28s)]
*  To pick a van. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5677.56s)]
*  Yeah, listen, it's entertaining. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5678.68s)]
*  Like I really do think it's early, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5681.04s)]
*  I used to watch like the early, early UFCs, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5683.400000000001s)]
*  no weight classes. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5685.6s)]
*  That was like ancient Rome, huh? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5686.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and you had to fight, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5687.32s)]
*  like you fight, you win, you fight again. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5688.36s)]
*  It's like tournament. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5690.08s)]
*  And people are like horrified. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5691.08s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5692.5599999999995s)]
*  It reminds me a little. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5694.0s)]
*  Because there's definitely something about it. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5695.2s)]
*  And I don't know what that says about the human psyche. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5697.16s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I wanna watch. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5698.8s)]
*  Like this is fucking interesting. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5700.08s)]
*  Like slap him harder. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5701.44s)]
*  So it's an interesting thing. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5702.88s)]
*  I think Dana's pretty confident it's gonna be successful. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5706.12s)]
*  And numbers are big, so we'll see. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5708.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to deny those clips when you see them. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5710.36s)]
*  It's like you wanna stay on it, but you don't want to. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5712.36s)]
*  It's like that and the people like [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5714.2s)]
*  attacking CVS workers. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5716.48s)]
*  Those are the two clips from like, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5718.36s)]
*  do I wanna keep watching this? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5719.5199999999995s)]
*  Bomb fights, like shit like that. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5720.36s)]
*  Like you just, now, I'm sure they'll have to, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5721.879999999999s)]
*  just like UFC, that's what I say. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5726.12s)]
*  If it continues and grows, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5727.96s)]
*  they'll have to put some regulations, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5729.5199999999995s)]
*  which he already said. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5730.919999999999s)]
*  But there's something there. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5732.0s)]
*  There's undeniable something there. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5732.919999999999s)]
*  Human psyche, it's like, yeah, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5735.0s)]
*  I wanna watch somebody get slapped. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5736.36s)]
*  It's so silly they do a somersault. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5738.32s)]
*  I don't know what it says about humans, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5741.08s)]
*  but like you said, people fucking used to go [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5742.5599999999995s)]
*  to Colosseum in Rome to watch fucking gladiators. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5746.0s)]
*  So there's something inherent to it. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5748.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5749.88s)]

*  and your journey through it. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5754.84s)]
*  Do you think that there'd be a, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5757.56s)]
*  do you ever start to have ideas of like, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5759.040000000001s)]
*  there's something else you wanna do down the line? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5760.68s)]

*  For doing watches. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5773.280000000001s)]
*  Because they're not cheap. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5774.4s)]
*  They're 2,400 bucks. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5776.28s)]

*  who take their watches so fucking seriously that I didn't. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5787.24s)]

*  but I think you look at someone's life [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5928.0s)]
*  and it looks so busy and insane and then you meet them [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PKFg0yme4&t=5929.56s)]
