*  Okay. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=360.98s)]
*  And they didn't get in until, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=361.82s)]
*  they basically got in like on the night before. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  They're supposed to come in like two weeks early. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  And it was a business plan this guy had. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  And so on 4th of July, he's like, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=372.18s)]
*  I have basically eight or nine hours [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=375.22s)]
*  to peddle these bitches. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=377.82s)]
*  He was out there with a bike with a little wagon. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=381.74s)]
*  He was pulling, like you're supposed to have a child [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=384.18s)]
*  in it or something, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=385.82s)]
*  but it was just full of these 4th of July shirts. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=386.66s)]
*  And he was out there just slanging them bitches. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=389.18s)]
*  And he only got rid of about maybe 17 of them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=391.7s)]
*  So he had about maybe 420 shirts left or whatever. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=395.54s)]
*  What'd he do with them? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  He said, here's what he did. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=400.18s)]
*  He set them on fire, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=401.66s)]
*  But he didn't near a fireworks display. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  And he said that some of the fireworks had landed in them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=407.74s)]
*  Hey, hey man. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  That's, I gotta respect the hustle there, bro. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=412.62s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=415.94s)]
*  It was a great idea, man. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=416.94s)]
*  He's got a lot, I bet he had a lot of great ideas. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=418.66s)]
*  I mean, maybe, is he still around? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=422.14000000000004s)]
*  We should hit him up, bro. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=424.06s)]
*  He's an idea, man. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=425.98s)]
*  I would say that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=426.82s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  He's an idea, man. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=428.5s)]
*  Yeah, man, you're playing some different venues now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=430.42s)]
*  So that's kind of changed, huh? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=432.53999999999996s)]
*  Has it? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=435.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've been doing arenas [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=436.9s)]
*  for like the last two or three years, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=438.62s)]
*  but it's just kind of to a bigger scale, I guess. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=440.38s)]
*  I mean, definitely got newer fans. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=444.18s)]
*  With this record, we kind of tapped into the mainstream [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=447.98s)]
*  kind of side of it, I guess. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=451.82s)]
*  We've always been independent. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=452.86s)]
*  And I mean, I guess coming out of Texas, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=455.58s)]
*  and you get to tour Texas year round [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=459.06s)]
*  and make a damn good living. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=460.9s)]
*  It's pretty much what we've been doing, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=463.02s)]
*  but over the last probably five years, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=464.46s)]
*  we've got out of Texas and got to play [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=468.5s)]
*  these crazy arenas and stuff. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=470.82s)]
*  That's crazy, look at that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's been a while. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=473.7s)]
*  We've been blessed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  Fans have just come out of the woodworks, man. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=476.38s)]
*  And it's cool to have people fuck with the music, man. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  And they fuck with what you're telling them, man. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=483.73999999999995s)]
*  And it's been wild. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=485.53999999999996s)]
*  It's kind of, we've been so busy, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=487.61999999999995s)]
*  I haven't had time to step back and actually look at it [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=489.94s)]
*  and kind of see where we're at, but it's wild, man. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=493.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  of that energy out of Texas where it's just like that, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=500.85999999999996s)]
*  we'll figure it out. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=504.09999999999997s)]
*  And Texas really supports their own a lot. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=504.94s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=506.94s)]
*  It's the same with guys like Parker over the years. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=507.78s)]
*  And I mean, Texas has their own thing, they always have. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=510.46s)]
*  They support their own. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=515.22s)]
*  Very proud people, man. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's just such a cult following. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=518.3s)]
*  And we've been blessed to have those cult fan base, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=522.14s)]
*  that fan base for so long. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=525.98s)]
*  Is there like co-beef between people, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=528.74s)]
*  new fans and old fans, do you feel like? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=532.46s)]
*  Maybe a little bit, but I mean, like I said, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=534.26s)]
*  they're so passionate and they're so like co-fans that, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=537.06s)]
*  I think they've, I was kind of curious as to how [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=541.86s)]
*  they're gonna take this new music that we put out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=545.18s)]
*  I mean, they came on with it, I think they dug it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=548.1s)]
*  Because we haven't really veered off from the shit [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  we've been doing our whole career, so. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=553.5s)]
*  Yeah, do you feel weird? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=556.3s)]
*  Do you feel like, is there a part of you that feels like, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=557.5s)]
*  because I get like, if I have to do something [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=560.26s)]
*  that feels kind of mainstream me to me sometimes, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=561.98s)]
*  it makes me fucking angry. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=564.42s)]
*  I don't mean, not really, because like I said earlier, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=567.58s)]
*  I'm still doing the same shit. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=570.42s)]
*  It's just more, I guess on a bigger scale, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=571.54s)]
*  kind of more, I don't know, kind of expected, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=575.02s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=581.1s)]
*  Like to do all these interviews and just kind of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=581.94s)]
*  get your story out there. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, it used to be, get fucked up, go play music, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=585.98s)]
*  and that was it, write music, throw down, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=589.94s)]
*  party with everybody, and now it's kind of, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=592.9s)]
*  all right, let's take a step back [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=595.06s)]
*  and calm everything down a little bit, you know? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=596.1s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah, dude. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=597.86s)]
*  Yeah, your TikToks, you guys would be just fucked up [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=599.38s)]
*  out there eating dandelions and shit, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=601.98s)]
*  or just adopting animals. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=603.98s)]
*  I mean, you guys are doing a lot for nature [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=607.14s)]
*  and everything out there. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=609.74s)]
*  Everything, man. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  Do you have to slow it down a little bit? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=611.6999999999999s)]
*  Have you had to a little? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=613.18s)]
*  This tour, we definitely did. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=614.54s)]
*  So last year's tour was the Hell Passive Tour, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=616.14s)]
*  and it was balls to the wall. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=618.18s)]
*  Like, it was insane, bro. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=620.22s)]
*  Like, it was too much, honestly. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=622.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised Mike died. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=625.6199999999999s)]
*  But we had a couple folks go to jail, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=628.3s)]
*  but other than that, I mean, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=630.26s)]
*  it was just chaos the whole time. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  And then this year with the Damn Near Normal Tour, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=633.0999999999999s)]
*  they kind of caged me a little bit. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=636.3399999999999s)]
*  So after every show, it was direct to the bus, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=638.78s)]
*  and then the cop escort out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=642.6199999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't let me go out and party and stuff, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=644.14s)]
*  which was great. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=645.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the tour was great and stuff, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=646.54s)]
*  but I felt like they were trying to settle me down [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=647.9s)]
*  a little bit, because I mean, like I said, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=650.98s)]
*  it's just kind of on a bigger scale [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=652.74s)]
*  than anybody kind of expected it to be. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=654.74s)]
*  Yeah, you got more responsibility the next day. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=657.1s)]
*  You got to actually be there. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=659.0600000000001s)]
*  And I felt a whole lot better this tour, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=660.78s)]
*  and the shows were better, in my opinion. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=662.94s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I guess you got to grow up sometime. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  It sucks, huh? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=669.78s)]
*  It sucks, man. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=670.7s)]
*  It sucks getting old. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=671.54s)]
*  It sucks having to grow up even. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=672.78s)]
*  And it's not even getting old. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=674.62s)]
*  Oh, you can stay young and just be an old dude, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=675.82s)]
*  and then you're kind of like, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=678.26s)]
*  damn, that old dude is, I shouldn't be. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=679.0600000000001s)]
*  It's like the FOMO though, like the fear, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=681.0600000000001s)]
*  like whenever it's just like, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=682.86s)]

*  us kind of doing a new music that we're not known for. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1136.02s)]
*  Usually it's the party music, the crazy rock stuff. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1141.2199999999998s)]
*  So this was just kind of the past, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1144.02s)]
*  the other lives that I could have lived [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1146.6599999999999s)]

*  like when it finally hit you. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1163.2199999999998s)]
*  Most of the songs came really quick, man. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1164.58s)]
*  Like Gabe Simon, he always say [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1166.34s)]

*  It was like bringing out shit that I'd normally [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1176.6599999999999s)]
*  never tell like a stranger. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1178.98s)]
*  And he just dug into it, man. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1181.78s)]
*  And it helped write the songs really fast, honestly. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1183.46s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know, man. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1186.5s)]
*  The songs came out great. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1189.46s)]
*  It was one of the more vulnerable sides of me, for sure. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1196.2199999999998s)]
*  No, I mean, it was just like, it was more raw and real [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1197.06s)]
*  than I feel like I'd ever been playing music. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1199.26s)]
*  So, yeah, it was kind of like kind of turning a new page [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1202.78s)]
*  on not leaving the party behind, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1207.5s)]

*  I don't know if I can legally say that or not. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1387.26s)]
*  It's just my belief. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1389.26s)]
*  And the mother had been envious of that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1390.86s)]
*  The mother, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1393.06s)]

*  And neither one of them could rat the other one out [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1408.94s)]
*  because they both had some. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1410.64s)]

*  The mother did it on purpose of her accident. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1420.22s)]
*  And then they both had to help each other cover it up. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=1422.22s)]

*  from being like a mainstream thing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2170.46s)]
*  Cause you don't have a PR guy telling you this [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2172.6600000000003s)]

*  and people have kinda embraced us for doing that [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2195.58s)]
*  and that's kinda like puts us apart from other people [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2198.58s)]

*  You know like I think it's kinda doing what you're talking [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2338.46s)]
*  about just going out and doing everything your own way. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2341.46s)]
*  You know paving your own road and just kinda [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2344.38s)]
*  being a trailblazer pretty much. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2347.02s)]
*  I think that's, that can go into being considered [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2348.5s)]
*  as being an outlaw. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2350.94s)]
*  Cause it's not the 80s anymore you know. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2352.9s)]

*  in high school was being a fucking narc. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2365.46s)]
*  Dude that's weird. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2367.14s)]
*  Bro they gave you a little card. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2368.86s)]
*  It was like congratulations. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2370.42s)]
*  Thank you for. You're a narc. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2372.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2373.46s)]
*  And it said it on the card and I was like, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2374.3s)]
*  that's the one thing you can't put on the card dude. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2376.98s)]
*  And then that dude would, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2380.14s)]
*  he would try to arrest people at a party or something. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2382.06s)]
*  People would beat the shit out of him. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2384.58s)]
*  Get the fuck away from me. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2386.42s)]
*  School's out bitch. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2387.38s)]
*  And then it would take the cops like three weeks [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2389.98s)]
*  to have a meeting with the kid or whatever. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2392.54s)]
*  And it's just the whole system. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2394.58s)]
*  That's why, yeah I wish, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2398.38s)]
*  I can go back and think about like the Motley Crue days. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2400.34s)]
*  Like the 80s bro. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2402.7400000000002s)]
*  Did you live through the 80s? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2404.82s)]
*  I was alive in them but yeah I was small. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2406.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah you were younger. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2408.86s)]
*  But yeah I mean you talk to guys like, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2409.9s)]
*  like I remember my first concert I went to [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2412.7000000000003s)]
*  was Marilyn Manson right. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2414.2200000000003s)]
*  And this dude took us and yeah, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2415.98s)]
*  or and he was like a, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2417.5s)]
*  I guess he was like a pedophile or whatever. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2419.1800000000003s)]
*  We didn't know he was right. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2420.6600000000003s)]
*  So he was just a guy we knew who was also a pedophile [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2422.94s)]
*  but we didn't know that part. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2426.34s)]
*  But anyway he took us over, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2428.5s)]
*  he's like I can get y'all to get some Marilyn Manson. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2430.06s)]
*  We just started listening to him dude. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2431.94s)]
*  And I think we were probably about 14. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2433.38s)]
*  And this dude dropped us off there [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2435.7s)]
*  and we were the only people underage that were in there. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2439.5s)]
*  Like they, I think it was probably an 18 show. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2441.58s)]
*  And like Manson like cut open Twiggy Ramirez [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2444.58s)]
*  or like one of his, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2448.3399999999997s)]
*  one of the other band members with a bottle. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2450.18s)]
*  Somebody cut, one of the band members cut themselves open [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2452.3799999999997s)]

*  He was like bleeding everywhere, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=2458.22s)]

*  and check on me like once a year or whatever. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3602.94s)]
*  And I'm never. Who do your parents? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3605.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, my parents. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3606.78s)]
*  And so I'm living basically in a garage, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3607.6200000000003s)]
*  on a couch in a garage, at one of my buddy's house. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3611.1000000000004s)]
*  And they like, they like come in and it's like, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3613.94s)]
*  and I'm, I was sick for some reason. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3618.5s)]
*  I had like the flu or something, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3620.46s)]
*  but I didn't have no money to go get no meds or nothing. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3621.82s)]
*  So they come up, take care of me, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3623.42s)]
*  and they're like, oh, we're coming up. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3624.62s)]
*  And they walk in this garage, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3626.14s)]
*  and there's like the cats running around and shit. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3627.62s)]
*  And I'm just kind of like laid up on the couch, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3630.26s)]
*  and they're like, ah, we ain't doing this shit. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3631.46s)]
*  Like, what is wrong with you, bro? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3633.3s)]
*  I was like, well, I'm sick right now. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3635.26s)]
*  They're like, well, this is not gonna happen anymore. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3637.7400000000002s)]
*  But I was too proud to be like, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3640.78s)]
*  to ask them for money and shit, you know, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3643.2200000000003s)]
*  because I just, I didn't want to go that route. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3644.7000000000003s)]
*  And so. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3647.94s)]
*  And you were out of school at that point? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3648.78s)]
*  I was out of school. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3649.6200000000003s)]
*  Did they know you were out of school or no? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3650.46s)]
*  Yeah, they knew. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3651.46s)]
*  And this was kind of like. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3652.3s)]
*  Now you graduated or no, you were just taking a break? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3653.5800000000004s)]
*  No, they kicked me out. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3654.94s)]
*  They said, get the fuck out of here. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3656.1000000000004s)]
*  Force break. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3657.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3658.42s)]
*  And so this is like two or probably three years, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3659.26s)]
*  probably 2014-ish. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3662.46s)]
*  And we're traveling, we're making, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3665.02s)]
*  we're not making great money, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3667.02s)]
*  but we're making enough for me to pay rent [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3668.06s)]
*  on a couch in a garage. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3670.86s)]
*  And so they were like, you know, my dad, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3672.58s)]
*  he's worked construction. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3675.14s)]
*  He's like, you know, come back. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3676.18s)]
*  You make pretty good money. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3677.94s)]
*  Couple years, you know, you can be a superintendent. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3679.3s)]
*  You'll run a crew like me. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3681.7s)]
*  I'm like, ah, you know, that sounds great. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3682.78s)]
*  But, you know, and I've got buddies [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3684.82s)]
*  that are out in the oil field, you know, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3686.46s)]
*  making damn good money. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3687.78s)]
*  And it's just, it was kind of a shitty, shitty time of life. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3689.3s)]
*  But I think that kind of, that stuff right there [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3692.38s)]
*  is kind of what helped build me to what I am today. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3695.66s)]
*  You know, it made me, you know, hard-shelled, you know, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3697.94s)]
*  and it kind of makes me appreciate everything [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3702.58s)]
*  that I've got going on now a little bit more, you know, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3704.8999999999996s)]
*  having to go through those times. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3706.98s)]
*  But yeah, my parents, they were like, this is not cool. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3708.1s)]
*  So you need to figure it out. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3712.8599999999997s)]
*  Like if you're going to do it, you know, do it. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3713.7799999999997s)]
*  So, man, they've been super supportive the entire time. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3715.2999999999997s)]
*  So it's been great. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3718.94s)]
*  Do you have any songs that are like about your mother [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3720.5s)]
*  or dad or anything like that? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3722.54s)]
*  Oh, no, surprisingly I don't. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3724.2599999999998s)]
*  I've got shit done on a song, so I'll probably write one now. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3726.7799999999997s)]
*  They're going to be watching. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3730.4599999999996s)]
*  They'll be like, no, we don't have a fucking song about this. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3731.2999999999997s)]
*  You know what? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3734.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you just never know, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3736.06s)]
*  because sometimes it's interesting where people, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3736.8999999999996s)]
*  how they find, it's kind of hard to write a song, you know, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3738.74s)]
*  like you see a lot of songs that are kind of love ballads, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3741.22s)]
*  you know? Yeah, for sure. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3743.3399999999997s)]
*  But it's hard to write one that, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3744.2599999999998s)]
*  Morgan has that one, what's it like? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3747.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, that's a banger. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3749.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, thought you should know. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3751.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's a banger. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3752.66s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of people out there [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3754.46s)]
*  that want to have a song like that. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3755.98s)]
*  I think it also touched on a nerve. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3757.94s)]
*  It's like, there's not really that son to mother song [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3759.26s)]
*  out there, or son to father song. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3761.94s)]
*  There's some of those more probably. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3764.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a hard song to write though, you know? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3765.94s)]
*  I feel like those songs are hard to write. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3767.46s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3770.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that Morgan song's a banger. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3772.78s)]
*  I've mentioned my parents in songs before, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3774.6600000000003s)]
*  but I just haven't wrote a song about them. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3777.06s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it'll happen. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3779.6600000000003s)]
*  Look, things happen as they happen. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3780.5s)]
*  I never really thought that it's kind of tough to create. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3783.1400000000003s)]
*  That's a tough one to kind of make. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3785.1400000000003s)]
*  I think that's why that one hit me so hard. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3786.98s)]
*  I think of Morgan's just because it did, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3788.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, it brings home for pretty much everybody. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3792.02s)]
*  You guys toured together some? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3795.42s)]
*  Yeah, we did AT&T with them this year. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3796.86s)]
*  Bro, that was wild. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3799.82s)]
*  How cool was that? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3800.78s)]
*  That's what I told them. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3801.6200000000003s)]
*  I was like, man, I appreciate you having me out. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3802.46s)]
*  To any of the shows would have been great, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3805.1000000000004s)]
*  but to play Cowboys Stadium, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3806.34s)]
*  Cowboys is my team, Rep Dallas. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3808.26s)]
*  Fuck, that was in that fucking hole. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3812.5s)]
*  I got out there and that's kind of what I was, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3813.82s)]
*  I couldn't even comprehend what was going on. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3816.98s)]
*  The whole time I'm just staring around [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3819.2200000000003s)]
*  and looking, trying to take it all in, bro. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3821.26s)]
*  It was like, what is going on, man? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3822.94s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3825.26s)]
*  It was something I'll never forget. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3826.6600000000003s)]
*  I can't thank Morgan enough for having us out. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3828.06s)]
*  Just to be able to do that, dude, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3831.34s)]
*  that's so crazy to have that moment [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3832.94s)]
*  to go walk out there like that. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3836.06s)]
*  It was just like, you just kept, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3838.6200000000003s)]
*  I never even been on the field before, right? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3840.66s)]
*  You just kept looking at people all the way up. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3842.82s)]
*  You're like, oh, what? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3844.94s)]
*  I was like, you know, I've been kicked out of the stadium [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3845.7799999999997s)]
*  a few times, so this was, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3847.94s)]
*  we had to get a couple signatures to get me in over there. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3849.74s)]
*  Dude, I'm in the back, they're like, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3852.7799999999997s)]
*  what the fuck, who let him back in here? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3853.86s)]
*  Yeah, bro, that's so great. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3858.58s)]
*  Has Dears Tour, now I'm guessing it's probably expanded. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3860.86s)]
*  I know that you had an audience [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3863.22s)]
*  that was outside of Texas for sure. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3864.1s)]
*  I know you have had a strong grassroots audience [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3865.5s)]
*  for a long time and even bigger than grassroots. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3867.82s)]
*  I don't mean to use those terms to sound like it isn't. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3870.02s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3873.94s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3874.78s)]
*  I'm not trying to like, okay. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=3875.62s)]

*  because there's so much shit going on. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4181.42s)]
*  Because right there next to Juarez. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4183.14s)]
*  Juarez is no, no. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4185.1s)]
*  Like, I don't think. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4186.3s)]
*  You play Juarez? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4187.14s)]
*  We haven't, but I mean, it's like, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4187.9800000000005s)]
*  they tell you not to go over there or whatever, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4189.9400000000005s)]
*  but I had a buddy who went over there like a month ago, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4192.9800000000005s)]
*  or two months ago, and he was like, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4195.42s)]
*  we just walked across and went and ate [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4197.5s)]
*  and had a couple beers and then came back over. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4199.62s)]
*  I was like, dude, what? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4201.18s)]
*  But yeah, man, El Paso, we record out there in Torneo, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4203.14s)]
*  just south of El Paso. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4207.22s)]
*  Torneo it's called? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4208.740000000001s)]
*  Torneo, yeah. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4209.58s)]
*  And it's a great time with food out there, phenomenal. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4210.42s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4214.42s)]
*  Best Mexican food you'll probably ever eat. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4215.34s)]
*  Outside of El Paso? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4217.34s)]
*  Outside of El Paso, in El Paso. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4218.54s)]
*  In El Paso. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4220.46s)]
*  If you're there, hit me up. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4221.58s)]
*  I'll send you some rest. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4223.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4224.5s)]
*  What do you think about now with music kind of moving forward? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4225.42s)]
*  What do you kind of look at? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4229.14s)]
*  I mean, you guys are touring off of Nine Lives now, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4230.78s)]
*  and then do you start to think about, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4233.9800000000005s)]
*  what do you kind of think about? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4237.14s)]
*  I know you have a Christmas album that's coming out. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4238.14s)]
*  Yeah, we have it coming out here in a couple days, I guess. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4240.22s)]
*  Couple days, I think December 6th. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4244.62s)]
*  Yeah, Friday. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4245.820000000001s)]
*  And then January, man, just came back from the studio, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4246.820000000001s)]
*  we'll start writing tomorrow for that, actually. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4251.34s)]
*  Stay here. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4253.42s)]
*  And then January, man, just came back in the studio, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4254.26s)]
*  trying to do the same thing, I guess. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4257.78s)]
*  Yeah, just that. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4261.66s)]
*  We got a lot of festivals this year coming up. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4263.38s)]
*  And then, I don't know, couple surprises. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4266.3s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4268.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4269.74s)]
*  We're excited about it, man. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4270.74s)]
*  This year was wild, man. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4272.98s)]
*  For us, it was insane. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4274.34s)]
*  And this year went by so fucking quick. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4276.62s)]
*  I know. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4278.3s)]
*  Like, dog. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4279.139999999999s)]
*  How is that? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4280.14s)]
*  What is that about? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4280.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4281.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's another part of getting older, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4282.660000000001s)]
*  but I just feel like it was New Year's Eve, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4284.06s)]
*  and now we're back at Christmas again, you know? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4287.14s)]
*  It was so fast, dude. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4289.18s)]
*  I think people are living fast, too, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4291.620000000001s)]
*  because of COVID or whatever. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4293.18s)]
*  I think people are trying to live as much as they can. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4294.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I can't tell you a little bit. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4296.5s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's it. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4297.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4298.820000000001s)]
*  But I just looked up, and I was like, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4299.660000000001s)]
*  because the tour went by. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4302.22s)]
*  The tour went by. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4303.18s)]
*  We were on the road for three months, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4304.14s)]
*  and it went by super quick. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4305.9400000000005s)]
*  I was looking forward to Europe, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4307.54s)]
*  but then Europe went by quick, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4308.5s)]
*  and I was like, holy shit. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4310.46s)]
*  So, I don't know, man. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4311.74s)]
*  Just getting back out there, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4313.86s)]
*  putting out some more music, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4315.5s)]
*  trying to keep the fans happy. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4316.58s)]
*  It all happens so fast, huh? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4320.26s)]
*  It does, man. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4321.34s)]
*  It's kind of weird how even you could be dreaming [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4322.18s)]
*  or hoping about something, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4323.78s)]
*  and it's the most important thing in the world. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4324.78s)]
*  And then it comes and it's gone. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4326.5s)]
*  Comes and it's like, oh, man. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4328.18s)]
*  Now what do I gotta look for? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4329.66s)]
*  I know. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4330.82s)]
*  I'm always pinning my, not necessarily my happiness, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4331.66s)]
*  but I'll be pinning a lot of my excitement [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4337.0599999999995s)]
*  on one day or one moment. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4339.66s)]
*  I do that a lot. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4341.5s)]
*  And there's such a buildup of it, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4342.34s)]
*  but then once it's gone, it's just, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4343.78s)]
*  it never even happened. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4345.38s)]
*  It's like, damn, that was it. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4346.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4348.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel the same shit, man. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4348.86s)]
*  I'll get so fixated on some shit, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4350.7s)]
*  and then once it's there, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4353.94s)]
*  try to relish it for as long as you can, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4356.0599999999995s)]
*  and then, but it goes by so quick. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4359.3s)]
*  They gotta get you on game day down there, man. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4361.58s)]
*  I know it, man. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4363.54s)]
*  That'd be a fun one. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4364.38s)]
*  Did you do that with, is that with Pat? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4365.22s)]
*  Yeah, I got to do it like a year ago. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4366.54s)]
*  It was great, dude. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4368.38s)]
*  They called literally the night before, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4369.22s)]
*  like 10 o'clock, like, you wanna come on tomorrow? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4370.780000000001s)]
*  And I was like, all right. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4372.42s)]
*  I wouldn't put me on. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4374.26s)]
*  Dude, we were talking about that at lunch. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4375.66s)]
*  Like, Pat is just like completely. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4377.26s)]
*  Oh, that guy's unreal. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4379.42s)]
*  Dude, he's insane. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4380.780000000001s)]
*  That guy's unreal, dude. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4382.06s)]
*  There's nobody like Pat McAfee, man. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4383.740000000001s)]
*  He's like the male Caitlin Clark of his job. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4385.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4388.900000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4399.54s)]
*  Or the Texas versus A&M. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4400.38s)]
*  Hey, did you watch that the other night? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4403.26s)]
*  It was great. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4404.82s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4405.66s)]
*  I think that was the, I think it was the first time, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4406.5s)]
*  what, like 11 or 12 years that they played, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4408.38s)]
*  and everybody was. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4411.3s)]
*  People were stoked. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4412.86s)]
*  Texas was on cloud 10, man. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4413.7s)]
*  We were fired up. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4416.9800000000005s)]
*  People were stoked, man. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4418.02s)]
*  What a great place to be from. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4419.66s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4421.18s)]
*  Because Texas, I feel like if, say, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4422.62s)]
*  if there's like people start to divide off [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4424.06s)]
*  into their own states, that's gonna be a state [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4425.5s)]
*  a lot of people don't wanna go live in. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4426.9800000000005s)]
*  For sure. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4428.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, hell, like everybody's starting to move down. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4429.780000000001s)]

*  I think at some event that they had, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4551.900000000001s)]

*  Well, he got in there and he read it [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4559.660000000001s)]
*  like he was reading it to his grandchildren [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4562.06s)]
*  or some shit. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4563.660000000001s)]
*  He did? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4565.38s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4566.219999999999s)]
*  Well, if you guys need somebody next year, man, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4567.0599999999995s)]
*  I was gonna say otherwise we could just record it right here. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4568.78s)]
*  I just didn't know what to do. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4571.34s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4572.86s)]
*  Yeah, what do you do with the Christmas album? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4575.0199999999995s)]
*  So what is it? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4576.74s)]
*  It's just like, I heard some of the ones from last year, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4577.58s)]
*  I saw like you guys had a cool animation that was online, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4579.0599999999995s)]
*  like you in the back of a Santa sleigh and stuff. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4581.82s)]
*  It's just like, just some like reimagined songs, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4583.86s)]
*  like we just, basically like covering them up [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4586.139999999999s)]
*  and just making them ours, so. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4588.78s)]
*  Like chestnuts roasting on like a, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4590.98s)]
*  On a bottle of fireball or something? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4593.54s)]
*  Yeah, fucking barbecue pit or some shit. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4595.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4596.94s)]
*  We, I don't know, it kind of gives us something to do [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4597.78s)]
*  at the end of the year, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4600.22s)]
*  so we're not usually not in the studio, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4601.34s)]
*  so just kind of gives us reason to, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4602.78s)]
*  and it's, you know, it's something that people can go back [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4605.26s)]
*  to every single Christmas, so, I don't know. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4608.9s)]
*  Do you, when you start thinking about, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4611.82s)]
*  like what are things you feel like are missing [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4615.9s)]
*  from your own life, do you feel? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4617.22s)]
*  Is that a weird question? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4620.58s)]
*  I don't know, I've been getting a lot of those today. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4622.34s)]
*  Very intimate questions. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4624.06s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4627.34s)]
*  I mean, you just hit such a neat place in your career. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4629.38s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4631.78s)]
*  I don't think it's anything career-wise. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4633.82s)]
*  I don't know, it's just always go, go, go, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4638.34s)]
*  and I don't know, you know, I think not having the, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4640.5s)]
*  maybe the alone time or whatever it is, you know, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4646.5s)]
*  just to kind of reset. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4649.22s)]
*  I was with Bobby and them earlier, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4650.98s)]
*  and we were talking about it, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4653.0199999999995s)]
*  and that was kind of one of the things I did on, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4653.86s)]
*  is just, I like being, like I'm a loner, you know, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4655.7s)]
*  and, because I'm always surrounded around people and stuff, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4659.179999999999s)]
*  but I like to have the time to myself [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4661.58s)]
*  just to kind of relax and reset and do all that shit, so. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4663.62s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know what is missing. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4668.5s)]
*  Life's good, man, life's good to me. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4671.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a good point too. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4673.219999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't have to be, you know, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4674.419999999999s)]
*  sometimes I'll like, I feel like I always need [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4675.62s)]
*  to have an answer for that question. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4678.219999999999s)]
*  I didn't even realize that until just now. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4679.46s)]
*  And then I'm kind of setting myself up for failure [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4681.66s)]
*  in a little bit of a way, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4683.78s)]
*  because I'm always thinking that there's something missing. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4684.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that could be a problem, but I mean, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4686.58s)]
*  but sometimes when life is as good as you think it is, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4690.86s)]
*  maybe it's not, you know, so, I don't know. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4693.66s)]
*  It must be inspiring to see your career evolve, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4697.38s)]
*  continue to evolve, right, and grow. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4700.94s)]
*  Your fan base continue to grow, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4703.179999999999s)]
*  because then you start thinking, well, what can I do? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4704.94s)]
*  You know, like, not that you don't think that before, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4707.42s)]
*  but you're like, okay, how can I challenge myself now? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4709.54s)]
*  How can I, what else could I maybe do? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4711.9400000000005s)]
*  I've got here, you know, where else could I go, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4714.74s)]
*  or what else could I do? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4716.66s)]
*  That's kind of interesting, you know, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4718.66s)]
*  because you don't know what this looks like [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=4719.78s)]

*  Yeah, it's great, dude. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5027.3s)]
*  And yeah, you guys are gonna be touring for how long? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5030.02s)]
*  Most of next year or what? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5031.54s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing a bunch of festivals and stuff, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5033.42s)]
*  and then hopefully getting a tour in towards the end [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5035.54s)]
*  of the year, maybe, planning on a new record. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5039.06s)]
*  So if we get that out, get a new tour going, all the goods. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5042.26s)]
*  Any new songwriters you wanna work with or anything like [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5047.18s)]
*  that, or what's that look like? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5049.26s)]
*  I know you, one night I called you and Ernest [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5050.1s)]
*  working together sometime. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5051.7s)]
*  Yeah, me and Ernest were out, I think we were out [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5052.54s)]
*  in El Paso whenever you could. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5054.18s)]
*  Y'all were fucking, he said he saw an alien or something. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5055.1s)]
*  Could've been high, could've been high. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5057.62s)]
*  There's no telling what. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5059.339999999999s)]
*  Don't fucking pay Odie and everything else out there. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5060.179999999999s)]
*  But yeah, man, I mean, I've started co-writing [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5063.94s)]
*  with a lot of people, man, and this last record [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5067.86s)]
*  was the first time that I'd done it, so yeah, man. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5070.179999999999s)]
*  I think it's just kinda opened up brand new ideas [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5073.62s)]
*  and stuff, man, just trying to do what's best for us. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5076.58s)]
*  Has it been hard for you to evolve? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5081.099999999999s)]
*  Is that a tough thing to change to do as an artist, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5082.66s)]
*  to think, okay, I'm gonna co-write or I'm not, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5085.22s)]
*  or is that, do you have certain rules for yourself [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5088.18s)]
*  and then those change, or do you not have [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5091.3s)]
*  any rules for yourself? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5092.7s)]
*  It was at first, to start with the co-writers, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5093.66s)]
*  because I've wrote, my first four records [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5096.26s)]
*  were completely just me. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5098.26s)]
*  And then, so to get into co-writing was kind of [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5100.3s)]
*  a hard-or-deal, and then now I've accepted a lot more. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5102.860000000001s)]
*  I feel like it's easier on me, especially with the [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5107.26s)]
*  headspace I'm in and so much that's going on, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5111.06s)]
*  and it helps to have other people's ideas outside [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5113.86s)]
*  looking in, so yeah, man, it's been a lot of fun. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5117.259999999999s)]
*  Like I said, with Gabe Simon and all those badass, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5122.98s)]
*  all these badass artists around here, man. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5126.38s)]
*  I met him with Dermot Kennedy, I think. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5128.219999999999s)]
*  Bring a picture of him up. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5130.82s)]
*  I think they were writing together. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5132.219999999999s)]
*  Probably. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5133.82s)]
*  Gabe Simon. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5135.54s)]
*  He worked with Nookon and a couple other. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5136.58s)]
*  A couple other. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5141.66s)]
*  Oh, Gabe. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5142.9s)]
*  I don't think that's him. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5143.9s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5144.74s)]
*  Not Gabe. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5145.58s)]
*  No, no, that's him, sorry, sorry. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5146.5s)]
*  That is Gabe, that is not the guy that I met, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5148.0199999999995s)]
*  but I would like to meet him sometime. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5151.42s)]
*  Small world, I look forward to meeting Gabe Simon. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5154.14s)]
*  He's a great dude, man. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5155.94s)]
*  No, this is, okay, now I feel like I need it, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5157.58s)]
*  but that's okay. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5159.26s)]
*  It was a different Gabe that I believe played [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5160.22s)]
*  with Dermot Kennedy over there. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5162.94s)]
*  We went to the Bluebird over there and watched him play. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5163.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, I just think that's interesting, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5169.7s)]
*  because yeah, it's like I always wanna do things [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5171.219999999999s)]
*  on my own, right? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5172.74s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5173.58s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'll do it on my own, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5174.42s)]
*  but then things kinda change. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5175.259999999999s)]
*  You're like, oh, I can't do it all on my own. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5176.54s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5177.94s)]
*  And so then I'm like, now I have to evolve a little bit. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5178.78s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5180.66s)]
*  I think, and I've always been like, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5181.5s)]
*  I hate to ask people for help, or I don't want anything. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5183.66s)]
*  That's just how I'm wired, but sometimes, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5185.94s)]
*  you know, I mean, you kinda gotta push your pride aside [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5188.379999999999s)]
*  and say hell with it, so. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5192.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5194.94s)]
*  Yeah, and then that's the times when you really kinda, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5196.0599999999995s)]
*  things get better, you know? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5198.0199999999995s)]
*  Honestly, yeah. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5199.139999999999s)]
*  Usually when I end up including other people, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5200.0199999999995s)]
*  and then I'm not doing anything alone, I think. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5201.62s)]
*  That's a thing that's a bummer. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5203.54s)]
*  Sometimes I think about like, it's not like, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5205.419999999999s)]
*  I think sometimes I would like to get married, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5209.139999999999s)]
*  you know, or something, I said that, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5210.66s)]
*  but I think it's because otherwise you do stuff, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5211.82s)]
*  and you don't have anybody to tell about it. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5215.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5216.66s)]
*  You're like, oh, I just, this was fun, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5217.5s)]
*  but it was by myself. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5219.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5220.54s)]
*  And you're like, well, shit, dude. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5221.379999999999s)]
*  And then your wife, one day your wife or whatever [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5222.82s)]
*  is gonna be like, shut up. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5225.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5226.099999999999s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5226.94s)]
*  Will you please stop telling me about this shit? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5227.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5228.62s)]
*  I wasn't there, dude. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5230.38s)]
*  I think that's good, man. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5233.3s)]
*  I think we've had a nice chat. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5234.26s)]
*  Hell yeah, that was awesome. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5235.5s)]
*  Co, congratulations, dude. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5236.74s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5238.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we look forward to just hearing more music [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5239.38s)]
*  and just watching your journey, man. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5241.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking tough to grow up, dude. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5242.82s)]
*  Don't do it all overnight, dude. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5244.38s)]
*  Yeah, not all overnight. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5246.54s)]
*  Yeah, we'll just keep easing into it. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5248.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5250.86s)]
*  Amen. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5252.0199999999995s)]
*  New Christmas album out now, and it's album Nine Lives. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5252.86s)]
*  Thanks again, Co, have a good one, man. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5255.26s)]
*  Appreciate it, Leo. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5256.38s)]
*  Yeah, Merry Christmas. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5257.22s)]
*  I'm just floating on the breeze [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5258.1s)]
*  And I feel I'm falling like these leaves [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5260.34s)]
*  I must be cornerstone [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5263.26s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5268.5s)]
*  I'll share this peace of mind I found [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5271.22s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5274.02s)]
*  But it's gonna take [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnOrhJ4kgMg&t=5278.700000000001s)]
