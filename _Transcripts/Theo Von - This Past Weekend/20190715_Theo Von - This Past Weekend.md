# Cheek to Seat  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #214
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [July 15, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA)
*  And I'm just trying to be alive, you know it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=0.0s)]
*  And this weekend I ate a whole sack of them Toll House morsels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=7.2s)]
*  Man, they, I don't know if you've ever seen them, they got that yellow sack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  They got that amarillo, I think is how you say it in Spanish. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=22.38s)]
*  They got that amarillo bolsa, that yellow sack of them little chocolate, you know, little nuggets. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=28.9s)]
*  Look like, I mean they look like almost like a little duty or something. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=36.9s)]
*  Like a real little bitty bear, maybe a bear that's, you know, about four inches tall came and did a little duty somewhere. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=40.9s)]
*  And that's the Nestle, Nestle, I believe, Toll House morsels. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=49.9s)]
*  And they are good. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=55.9s)]
*  And look, you have, here's the thing, the sack of them, the way they built the sack, if you open it a bunch kind of spill out. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=57.9s)]
*  So I don't know, it's kind of like, I don't want to say it's like that movie, you know, Amistad or anything, but it's kind of, you know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=66.9s)]
*  you know, they got too many in the bag kind of thing, you know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=76.9s)]
*  And so, you know, next thing you know, they got a couple of those little sweet chocolate morsels just, you know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=81.9s)]
*  maybe you put a couple in your hand or, but then it's, you know, some spill on the counter. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=87.9s)]
*  Next thing you know, you've had 10, 11, 19. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=92.9s)]
*  And I probably had, I don't really want to be honest with myself about it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=95.9s)]
*  I probably had 240 of them, you know, so that's, I mean, I guess that's kind of where I'm at right now, you know, but let's get into it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=101.9s)]
*  Man, they good. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=131.9s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground, I'll share this piece of my life out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=161.9s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=176.9s)]
*  Them clavies, baby. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=179.9s)]
*  Come on, let's go. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=184.9s)]
*  We could do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=185.9s)]
*  For me to set that pocket break and let myself all mine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=186.9s)]
*  Shine that light on me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=192.9s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my story. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=198.9s)]
*  Shine on me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=203.9s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=207.9s)]
*  I'll find a song. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=209.9s)]
*  I'll sing it just for you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=211.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=221.9s)]
*  Hey, what's up? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=222.9s)]

*  And they are a band out of Natchez, Louisiana or Mississippi, sorry. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=226.9s)]
*  And it's so close you can't even tell which one you're in. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=233.9s)]
*  I mean, you could if you had really long legs, you could be in in Mississippi and Louisiana at the same time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=237.9s)]
*  You're going to have to probably be at least about I would guess probably about eight feet tall because you're going to have to really you're going to you just need a little bit of room. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=245.9s)]
*  You got to make sure you're in each one because you got a pot out at the bottom sort of. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=254.9s)]

*  What's going on? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=275.9s)]
*  What's going on with me? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=276.9s)]
*  I guess it's summertime. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=278.9s)]
*  That's what I'm realizing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=280.9s)]
*  You know, and it's summer. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=281.9s)]
*  And this is the kind of time of year I remember. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=285.9s)]
*  When at summertime you go to the pool, you might see a little while if you're around that age when you really when you got really perverted kind of starts kind of whispering in your ear. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=289.9s)]
*  Because perverted if you're going through perverted pervert is a real ghost, you know. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=306.9s)]
*  It's it's invisible to you for years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=312.9s)]
*  You know, you're a child and you don't you don't see nothing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=315.9s)]
*  When you're a real young a titty could roll across the street. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=320.9s)]
*  You don't care. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=323.9s)]
*  You know, a whole battleship full of wieners could just, you know, capsize right out front of your house. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=325.9s)]
*  If you're a young lady, you don't care. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=332.9s)]
*  You're like, oh, what is all it is? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=334.9s)]
*  What are all of these, you know, these weird, you know, these weird little kind of arms, you know, that don't have bodies and it hooked to them? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=336.9s)]
*  Because because that because that that perverted ghost hadn't started really whispering to you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=347.9s)]
*  And then when you hit about 13 to 14, that ghost is he kind of just playing video games and suddenly you hear something in your ear like, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=356.9s)]
*  what you think about some titty? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=373.9s)]
*  And they'll try to pretend like they're still a ghost. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=384.9s)]
*  But really, they just it's just purebred coming at you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=386.9s)]
*  So but that's what time it is. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=390.9s)]
*  Minus summertime is summertime. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=393.9s)]
*  And the kids, I bet the kids, you're inside. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=397.9s)]
*  I know the kids are inside. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=401.9s)]
*  It's starting to get a little touchy feely. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=403.9s)]
*  I bet it's starting to get a little bit intense. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=409.9s)]
*  You know, it's getting a little bit hot, hot. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=412.9s)]
*  But purebredy come and it really starts. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=416.9s)]
*  It starts getting you going. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=418.9s)]
*  If you're young member, that's when summer would always. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=420.9s)]
*  That's when puberty would always hit somebody in summertime that you did that long. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=424.9s)]
*  I know you like playing hide and go seek. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=435.9s)]
*  But what about some titties? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=439.9s)]
*  And everything started to change. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=446.9s)]
*  You know, you'd have a water slide at the beginning of summer. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=450.9s)]
*  And by the end of the summer, you're trying to you're trying to slide into the neighbor's daughter. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=453.9s)]
*  That was just different time. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=459.9s)]
*  It just was it was same times, actually. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=460.9s)]

*  It was just something that happened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=466.9s)]
*  And your buddy come back from school, he have a beard, you know, your friend. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=468.9s)]

*  I was really in a and they had a next to us was special education. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=600.9s)]
*  And and I would sneak in there and steal. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=608.9s)]
*  They had these kind of orange slices and these lime slices, these kind of green little sugar look like a little like somebody like a little handful of somebody made a little sugar. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=612.9s)]
*  Chewy sugar chunk. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=629.9s)]
*  These little sugar hitters and I'd sneak in there and eat them all. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=632.9s)]
*  While the while the special ed kids were out doing recess or just doing something, I don't even know what they were doing. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=636.9s)]
*  It's riding around town or whatever, you know, not at school or not in the classroom. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=643.9s)]
*  And and honestly, I've always felt a little bit bad about that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=648.9s)]
*  So I want to apologize about that right now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=653.9s)]
*  I would sneak in there and do it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=657.9s)]
*  Sometimes I would lock myself in the cab in the cupboard. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=659.9s)]
*  They had a tall cupboard. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=663.9s)]
*  I'd get in there and I'd start eating these candies because our teacher, Miss Lewis, would give you permission to go to the restroom sometimes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=664.9s)]
*  If you were an appropriate child. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=675.9s)]
*  Now, we had some inappropriate. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=679.9s)]
*  You know, we had some real inappropriate kind of milling around. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=681.9s)]
*  We had kids who, you know, alphabet deniers and stuff, you know, kids that didn't want to read and all kinds. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=685.9s)]
*  But she would let you go get to the to the restroom and see you be in the hall by yourself. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=692.9s)]
*  So I'd sneak in at the special ed room and get their candies and get in that candy closet. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=699.9s)]
*  And the second I opened that door, they had so many candy. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=705.9s)]
*  They had those tootsie roll, the long ones, you know, that kind of make you fool. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=711.9s)]
*  They kind of make you really. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=720.9s)]
*  They kind of make you start thinking about what you're into as a young fellow. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=723.9s)]
*  You know, you put two of them big fellows in your mouth. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=726.9s)]
*  You might, you know, you might, you might end up in a unique parade later on in your life. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=729.9s)]
*  And so I'd get in there and I'd start just eating the lime slices and eating. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=737.9s)]
*  I'd have probably maybe 30 pieces of candy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=741.9s)]
*  And then I'd come back to the class and I'd have forgotten to go urinate. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=744.9s)]
*  And so I'd have to sit there the rest of the time and suffer with the full bladder. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=749.9s)]
*  And it's funny because the pain of having to urinate would almost be it would every time I remembered I got a piece so bad, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=756.9s)]
*  I would feel ashamed because I'd stolen them children's candies, their sweet, the sweet treats. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=763.9s)]
*  And anyway, I'm sorry, I'm rambling. Yes, thank you for calling in. Onward. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=770.9s)]
*  Since I'm a special ed teacher and I work right now in behavior specifically, it's very stressful. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=775.9s)]
*  So I'd like to start off my day with one of your episodes because it just kind of sets me in that mood to get ready and be positive [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=782.9s)]
*  and know that everything is going to be OK. So thank you, dude, for all that you do. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=791.9s)]
*  Thank me. Thank you. You know, I think about that as brave you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=797.9s)]
*  It's a well, it's not you have a special gift to be able to work with children that's really, you know, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=804.9s)]
*  that have autism or, you know, unique gifts from God or they're a lot of mentally challenged people. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=811.9s)]
*  It seemed like they're doing more insider trading. It seemed like they're operating on the inside. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=819.9s)]
*  You know, we're out here operating on the outside for the most part. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=824.9s)]
*  And some of us are 100 percent out here and nothing inside. And some of us are 50 50. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=828.9s)]
*  But sometimes a lot of, you know, mental children, when I was growing up, it would seem they were. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=836.9s)]
*  They were they were they were more like 80 inside 20 outside. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=842.9s)]
*  So they had a lot more, you know, you got to it's almost like a Rubik's Cube. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=851.9s)]
*  You got to do a lot of twisting and turning to kind of get the get the walls to all match up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=855.9s)]
*  And it takes a lot of patience. So I can't even really imagine, you know, how much patience you have to be. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=861.9s)]
*  You must you must you must just have to be full of patience because I mean, I just imagine if we cracked you open that something would come out. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=870.9s)]
*  But only if we waited a while because that's patience. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=882.9s)]
*  You know, like I just can't imagine it, you know, and and so thank you for your service right there. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=888.9s)]
*  And and thank you for the compliment. And I hope you have a great day today. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=896.9s)]
*  You know, I hope you, you know, and those kids that you're working with in the future, they get the next go around. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=899.9s)]
*  They get the big trip next time. You know, we all we all take turns. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=906.9s)]
*  I believe that like I'm here this time doing what I do, being a loud mouth. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=911.9s)]
*  And next time I'll be, you know, I'm kind of a more sensitive, loud mouth. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=918.9s)]
*  Next time I might be a warrior like a deaf warrior. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=923.9s)]
*  So you'll see me with no listening skills, but maybe be a lightweight champion of the world. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=927.9s)]
*  Or I might be like, you know, a little show animal or something that, you know, doesn't do a lot and does, you know, does cigarettes or something. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=934.9s)]
*  So it's you know, everybody gets the term where you have where we get to see what it's like to be that next thing, that next type of person. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=946.9s)]
*  So I guess I'm just envious. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=957.9s)]
*  You know, I had a day one time I was a student and we went to India Earth and we worked on a disabled children's home over there. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=960.9s)]
*  And a lot of these children didn't have wheelchairs or chairs. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=972.9s)]
*  And they were just crawling around on the ground, you know, and and our job for the day was to help move. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=977.9s)]
*  They had different sediment and different pieces of cement or something. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=986.9s)]
*  I don't know what had happened. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=989.9s)]
*  Somebody left a probably look about two dump trucks full of some pieces of big cement at a at a disabled children's home. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=991.9s)]
*  And we moved it and we made it and moved it around and opened up a little play area for them. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1000.9s)]
*  But but man, it was you know, it was the one day in my life where I really felt of service like 100 percent. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1005.9s)]
*  I remember getting to the end of that day and just feeling like, wow, man, just felt so good. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1014.9s)]
*  But thank you for your service. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1022.9s)]
*  I'm glad we can get you going. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1023.9s)]
*  I'm glad to be a part of whatever we're doing here and getting you going. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1024.9s)]
*  So I hope you have a wonderful day over there. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1028.9s)]
*  Let's get it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1030.9s)]
*  Who else is listening? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1031.9s)]
*  Let's try it one more. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1032.9s)]
*  Hey, my name is Tim. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1033.9s)]
*  Big Tim out there. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1035.9s)]
*  And, you know, Tim is always that kind of neighbor guy. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1037.9s)]
*  You know, he's a little someone he'll be out shooting hoops at night. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1040.9s)]
*  But you're like, damn, what's going on, Tim? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1045.9s)]
*  You you got a family, you know, or Tim's the kind of guy where, you know, you won't have seen his wife for like a month. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1047.9s)]
*  And you'd be like, damn, Tim. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1054.9s)]
*  Where's Diane? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1056.9s)]
*  But let's hear more. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1059.9s)]
*  Thank you for listening, Tim. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1060.9s)]
*  And I listened to your podcast after I dropped my kids off. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1061.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, man. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1066.9s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1067.9s)]
*  Actual kids, because that's a euphemism also for going to the restroom. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1068.9s)]
*  Onward at school. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1074.9s)]
*  I'm a stay at home dad and so D. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1076.9s)]
*  And so D. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1080.9s)]
*  Damn, boy. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1084.9s)]
*  Stay at home, dad. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1086.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1089.9s)]
*  Oh, that'd be so much fun because I remember staying at home when I was a kid. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1091.9s)]
*  Shit was great. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1096.9s)]
*  Making stuff, making your own food. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1099.9s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1101.9s)]
*  Do one day for lunch, bro. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1103.9s)]
*  I had 16 pieces of cheese. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1104.9s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1107.9s)]
*  Cheese steaks. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1112.9s)]
*  I remember I heard about cheese steaks and a cheese steak is when I guess I don't know. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1113.9s)]
*  But I thought it was that you just put a bunch of cheese in like a, you know, as much of a meat shape as you could and just had that bitch, you know? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1122.9s)]
*  So I made a perfect T-bone out of cheese, out of about 16 pieces of American. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1131.9s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1136.9s)]
*  GBA boy got blessed and had me a beautiful ass cheese steak while I watched. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1138.9s)]
*  It wasn't one life to live or something. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1145.9s)]
*  My grandmother got me on to some of the soap operas. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1149.9s)]
*  And a soap opera is something basically where it's like a lot of, I guess it's kind of where people, they fantasize, I think, about having sex with somebody else. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1154.9s)]
*  But instead of doing that, they just watch a soap opera and have a snack. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1164.9s)]
*  What else we got? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1169.9s)]
*  Thank you for calling, Tim. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1173.9s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1174.9s)]
*  And I love how real you talk. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1175.9s)]
*  You don't hold anything back. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1177.9s)]
*  I'm in Wisconsin and I'm sure you know, like, your vibe is felt the same everywhere. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1179.9s)]
*  But we definitely feel it out here. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1185.9s)]
*  Bye, buddy. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1188.9s)]
*  Love you. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1189.9s)]
*  Love you too, Tim, man. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1190.9s)]
*  Thanks for calling. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1192.9s)]
*  And dude, have fun at the house today. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1193.9s)]
*  If the ladies out there working, do get a slip and slide. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1196.9s)]
*  Sell the fucking furniture, dude, online. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1202.9s)]
*  Do you live in the dream? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1205.9s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1208.9s)]
*  Oh, man, when you were at home, that was one thing nicer in summertime when you were home. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1210.9s)]
*  Wake up as long as there was milk. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1216.9s)]
*  If there wasn't milk, my day was going to hell. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1220.9s)]
*  But if there was milk, I was feeling good. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1224.9s)]
*  Because you could have cereal, get a little bit of this, cut on an episode of something, do a video game. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1228.9s)]

*  He's got a wildcat with him named Gucci Barry. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1768.9s)]
*  And this guy, he's probably 50 years old, you know, half of his teeth. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1770.9s)]
*  He's always getting people beating him in the nuts and stuff online. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1776.9s)]
*  To me, it's not my vibe, really, really at all, really. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1781.9s)]
*  But he's a nice guy. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1785.9s)]
*  And I roll up to the improv. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1787.9s)]
*  They're out front with no shirts on. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1789.9s)]
*  Zero shirts. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1794.9s)]
*  I've been, I've gone to the improv for 15 years. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1797.9s)]
*  I've gone to the improv in Hollywood, California on Melrose Avenue. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1800.9s)]
*  Never once have I seen someone without a shirt on there. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1807.9s)]
*  But today, I roll up there sitting out front, no shirts, boy. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1813.9s)]
*  I say gang, gang, baby. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1819.9s)]
*  It's people. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1822.9s)]
*  You know, it's people. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1824.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's just, it's people, man. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1827.9s)]
*  And the second I feel like I'm not people, man, I don't care what they are. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1830.9s)]
*  I don't care if David's black or white or Latino or, you know, Peruvian [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1834.9s)]
*  or Veruca Salt or whatever he is, you know? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1840.9s)]
*  I don't care if he fucking reaches into his pants and pulls out a damn tail. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1845.9s)]
*  It's people. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1851.9s)]
*  So anyway, I shouldn't, it didn't bother me. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1853.9s)]
*  It just made me, I don't know, part of me did worry. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1856.9s)]
*  It was like, well, what if, you know, if people think that I'm associated with these kind of people [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1859.9s)]
*  or if they think I'm this, then what is that going to be? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1863.9s)]
*  I guess in the end, I guess I'm really just disappointed that it made me doubt myself. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1866.9s)]
*  You know, it made me think, well, what are people going to think? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1871.9s)]
*  Because I like to, you know, I wish I didn't live in that space where I worried about that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1877.9s)]
*  Where I worried about what people thought. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1883.9s)]
*  What's in their heads about me. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1886.9s)]
*  And I hope to get there, you know, I hope to aim to be in that space more. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1891.9s)]
*  And I don't even know how I ever got there probably when I was young. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1897.9s)]
*  Well, I think probably I didn't know how I felt about myself. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1902.9s)]
*  You know, I had no real self-awareness. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1906.9s)]
*  And the only way I did feel about myself wasn't good. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1910.9s)]
*  So, of course, I'm going to need other people to like me. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1914.9s)]
*  I'm going to need them to feel good. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1918.9s)]
*  Because that's the only way I know if I'm doing okay. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1921.9s)]
*  You know, if I ask myself, it's like yelling into a cave when I was young. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1925.9s)]
*  So, it almost makes sense that I even do work as a comedian. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1932.9s)]
*  Because it's like I needed to know that it's like I got my own feeling of feeling okay from them. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1941.9s)]
*  So, it's almost like I'm trying to think about this a little more. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1954.9s)]
*  I know in a simple way it's like, oh, what do people think about you? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1960.9s)]
*  Oh, you care about what people think about you, yes. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1964.9s)]
*  But I'm trying to think about how I got what I thought about myself from how other people responded to me. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1967.9s)]
*  I think that really is more how what was going on with me. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1984.9s)]
*  Because that's the only way I knew. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1991.9s)]
*  So, I just wasn't filled up with, hey, you're okay. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=1994.9s)]
*  There wasn't enough of those. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2002.9s)]
*  And if there were, maybe there were and I couldn't even hear them. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2004.9s)]
*  And that's where sometimes it's like, man, we're all special Ed. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2008.9s)]
*  We're all special needs. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2013.9s)]
*  And it makes me feel good to know that there's a lady out there. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2018.9s)]
*  Hey, Theo, I'm calling from Arizona. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2022.9s)]
*  I'm a special Ed who's driving somewhere to take care of some kids. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2025.9s)]
*  Man, that's great. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2032.9s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2034.9s)]
*  It's nice to know that there is when these kids get home that this guy, my name is Tim, and I listened to your podcast after I dropped my kids off at school. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2035.9s)]
*  I'm a stay at home dad. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2047.9s)]
*  That when the kids get off the bus, Timmy's out there with a little tray of muffins or a cigarette. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2049.9s)]
*  I don't know if the kids smoke or what he does with his kids, but he's out there. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2056.9s)]
*  That's nice to know that the, you know, that people that that we're filling these youngsters up with some type of connection. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2060.9s)]
*  I'm just kind of rambling. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2073.9s)]
*  But yeah, what else is going on with me right now? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2075.9s)]
*  You know, I've just been trying to think about like, you know, just kind of, I guess just kind of wanting to just I've just been feeling so busy sometimes. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2086.9s)]
*  I've been feeling so busy sometimes that I don't know. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2101.9s)]
*  It's hard to know like if I'm feeling okay or not. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2104.9s)]
*  So I've got to try and check in with myself a little bit more and just kind of, you know, just make sure that I'm doing okay. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2106.9s)]
*  And I feel like I am. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2112.9s)]
*  It was just, you know, I used to have just kind of more time to just, you know, I guess just even chill out or take a nap or get a little frosty or something. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2116.9s)]
*  I love frosties. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2128.9s)]
*  And I love what else do I love? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2130.9s)]
*  You know what I miss? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2133.9s)]
*  I was thinking about the other day. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2134.9s)]
*  Musical chairs. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2136.9s)]
*  Do you remember musical chairs? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2138.9s)]
*  Remember at school? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2143.9s)]
*  I don't even know when it happened. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2144.9s)]
*  But about once every two years, some new legislation came down at school and they once again allowed kids to play musical chairs. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2147.9s)]
*  That's where they put like seven chairs in the middle of a room and they put like 40 kids in the room. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2160.9s)]
*  And it was just bonkers. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2166.9s)]
*  You remember how crazy it was? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2168.9s)]
*  You remember it? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2170.9s)]
*  It was like it was almost like the Royal Rumble, like WWF Royal Rumble. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2172.9s)]
*  And they had everybody all suddenly every you start to see who people are. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2178.9s)]
*  You'd have a little, you know, a couple sets of twins, these two females, brother over there sharpening their teeth with a real file. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2183.9s)]
*  You're like, damn, these bitches getting a seat. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2189.9s)]
*  Suddenly all the white kids were like, oh, we're going to have a chance to do something athletically. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2194.9s)]
*  Musical chairs. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2201.9s)]
*  And then the music would start all around the mulberry bush. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2205.9s)]
*  And people are just eyeing the other person. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2212.9s)]
*  Suddenly a friend was not a friend at all. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2219.9s)]
*  Suddenly some kid had just reached in his bag and has painted his face up like William Wallace. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2223.9s)]
*  You know, he's like, we are free. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2230.9s)]
*  Tell them Scotland is free. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2232.9s)]
*  Other kids was getting scared. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2236.9s)]
*  One kid fainted, bro. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2239.9s)]
*  Dude, whatever, son. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2241.9s)]
*  You out, bro. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2244.9s)]
*  You out. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2246.9s)]
*  You can't handle musical chairs. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2247.9s)]
*  You ain't going to handle musical the rest of your life then. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2248.9s)]
*  Go move to somewhere else, bro, and be weak, daddy. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2252.9s)]
*  We got to go. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2255.9s)]
*  And then it would stop. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2256.9s)]
*  And people, you'd see some kid pull out a blade. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2261.9s)]
*  You know, some rich kid would bring a chair from home. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2265.9s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2268.9s)]
*  Fauntleroy's all, he's cheating. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2269.9s)]
*  They had some pedos on the side betting on it, laying money. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2274.9s)]
*  You know, plus 750 on Little Reginald over there. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2278.9s)]
*  And the teacher was smoking cigarettes. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2282.9s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2284.9s)]
*  And then just all these cheeks flying. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2285.9s)]
*  It was butt first. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2288.9s)]
*  It was butt first. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2290.9s)]
*  And there's just nothing more just quirky and silly than a bunch of [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2293.9s)]
*  children's butts all flying in the same direction at once. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2298.9s)]
*  And you had to get cheek to seat. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2302.9s)]
*  Some kids, they go for a chair and miss it completely, shatter their [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2305.9s)]
*  legs, shatter their spine, end up in a bag, you know, end up traveling [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2308.9s)]
*  by sack for the rest of their lives on their dad or mom's back if their [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2313.9s)]
*  mom was strong. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2317.9s)]
*  Just, you know, you had to get two cheeks on the seat and it was yours. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2319.9s)]
*  And you had somebody be yelling in the distance, somebody be yelling, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2326.9s)]
*  cheek that seat, cheek that seat. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2328.9s)]
*  There's people crawling through pipes full of duty. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2334.9s)]
*  And they said it would take a man 600 years to get out of that same [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2337.9s)]
*  prison. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2340.9s)]
*  But musical chairs, Randall did it in less than 20. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2342.9s)]
*  And you know little Daniel's back there in the back. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2347.9s)]
*  He got him a little Santa sack and he's not even playing. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2350.9s)]
*  He's just stealing people's stuff. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2353.9s)]
*  I mean, he's back there. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2357.9s)]
*  He's taking these like just mom-made sandwiches and Game Boys and just [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2358.9s)]
*  filling up a sack. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2362.9s)]
*  And he's just, he leaped out the window right under the back of a greyhound. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2363.9s)]
*  He left town that we never even saw him. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2368.9s)]
*  You know Daniel, you know, he makes his own choices. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2371.9s)]
*  But damn, boy, musical chairs, the game ends, somebody, it came down to two [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2375.9s)]
*  people, one chair. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2380.9s)]
*  And it was actually kind of a great thing for regular life. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2384.9s)]
*  This is regular life. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2387.9s)]
*  It's going to be survival of the fittest. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2390.9s)]
*  You got to get that ass right. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2394.9s)]
*  Because it's cheek first sometimes. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2396.9s)]
*  You got to put your ass on the line. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2398.9s)]
*  And you know, somebody wins, and you win and they're supposed to give you some [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2403.9s)]
*  candies and they go in the cupboard and who knows, some little asshole kid [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2407.9s)]
*  ate all of them lime slices. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2413.9s)]
*  Some sneaky little white boy, that polly Nicaragua, snacked up all the lime [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2416.9s)]
*  slices. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2423.9s)]
*  And little Daniel, he's already, he's halfway to Tacoma. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2424.9s)]
*  And he gots that bag of, you know, maybe lukewarm muffins and some ham [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2427.9s)]
*  sandwiches and some pudding packs, bruh. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2432.9s)]
*  And he's keyed up. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2435.9s)]
*  Come on, boy, get in there. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2436.9s)]
*  Man, I just, I mean, it was God's game. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2439.9s)]
*  I mean, it was God's game, man. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2444.9s)]
*  Let's get into a couple more calls. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2447.9s)]
*  Here's one we got. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2451.9s)]
*  As always, the hotline is 985-664-9503. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2452.9s)]
*  And the hotline is, you know, it's just, you know, if something's going on, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2457.9s)]
*  what's happening? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2463.9s)]
*  If you're struggling with something, if there's something that we can try to do [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2465.9s)]
*  to help, if you want to share a response to something on the show, you can [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2469.9s)]

*  And again, it's 985-664-9503. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2475.9s)]
*  Let's take a call right here. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2478.9s)]
*  Hey, what's going on, Theo? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2479.9s)]
*  It's Jonathan from Shreveport. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2481.9s)]
*  What's up, Shreveport? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2483.9s)]
*  And I used to, the cops after the comedy, the cops would come by these bicycle [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2486.9s)]
*  cops and they would taze you if you wanted. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2491.9s)]
*  And you didn't even have to be a criminal. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2494.9s)]
*  And they would taze you with the damn taser. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2497.9s)]
*  So, you know, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2500.9s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2503.9s)]
*  Man, I was listening to the podcast earlier and you were talking about being [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2504.9s)]
*  in a relationship. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2509.9s)]
*  I think you're 39 and I'm 35, man. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2511.9s)]
*  And I was scared of relationships just like you for a long time because, like, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2516.9s)]
*  I come from alcoholic parents and I'm a little bit of a [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2522.9s)]
*  And, man, it was like, oh, and dealing drugs for a long time. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2526.9s)]
*  It was like everybody was business related or business oriented. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2531.9s)]
*  Like I had girlfriends, but they were more like homeboys, you know? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2535.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, drugs will make a turn of events. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2539.9s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a big fan of drugs. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2543.9s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of drugs. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2546.9s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of drugs. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2548.9s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of drugs. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2550.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, drugs will make a turn of girlfriend into more of a girl fiend, you know? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2553.9s)]
*  But I met Stephanie, the woman I'm with now, and, dude, it really changed me. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2559.9s)]
*  I mean, she's a genuine person. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2567.9s)]
*  So it is worth the risk to face the fear, I would say. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2569.9s)]
*  Gang, man. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2576.9s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that, dude. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2577.9s)]
*  Yeah, I guess everybody needs a little Stephanie on them. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2579.9s)]
*  Everybody needs... [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2584.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure somebody comes along and kind of just makes it... [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2586.9s)]
*  I mean, my biggest fear, I think right now in like a practical sense, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2591.9s)]
*  on a surface sense, is I just don't... [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2596.9s)]
*  I don't know that I trust myself not to cheat, not to... [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2599.9s)]
*  You know, I still got that sugar lizard sometimes in my wiener, you know, in my body wiener. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2606.9s)]
*  And, you know, if that lizard gets thinking, bruh, then I'll, you know, I'll get pinking, you feel me? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2615.9s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of obtuse, and I want to say that, but I try to get out there looking for some loin. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2624.9s)]
*  You know, I'll get out there kind of just... [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2630.9s)]
*  Just kind of just standing around, just kind of looking for some trim, trimming them, whatever you say I am, you know? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2633.9s)]
*  Mom's spaghetti, bruh, you feel me? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2643.9s)]
*  I'll take a girl out for mom's spaghetti to try to fricking serve up that meatball, you got it? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2645.9s)]
*  So I just... [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2652.9s)]
*  I don't know sometimes, man. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2655.9s)]
*  I think that's one of the things. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2656.9s)]
*  And then I... [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2658.9s)]
*  Fuck, bruh, I got so many fucking problems, bruh. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2659.9s)]
*  Jesus Christ, dude. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2662.9s)]
*  I might as well just build a church around my damn head and my heart. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2664.9s)]
*  I might as well... [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2668.9s)]
*  You know what I should do is just live in a church or something like that. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2669.9s)]
*  It would help, or a TP or a Native American church. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2673.9s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2676.9s)]
*  You sound like you might be on a couple of lewds as well, daddy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2677.9s)]
*  You might be, you know, a couple of milligrams deep right now. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2680.9s)]
*  Because now that I got kids, everything's different, man. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2684.9s)]
*  Like I stopped doing everything illegal, started making legal money. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2688.9s)]
*  I mean, it's been a real, real long road, but it's really worth it. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2694.9s)]
*  And I didn't trust anybody, man. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2700.9s)]
*  At one time, if I couldn't make a dollar off of you, I didn't really mess with you. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2703.9s)]
*  Gang, bruh. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2708.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2710.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I feel you in a lot of that. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2711.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you got to have opportunity for transformation. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2714.9s)]
*  And it sounds like somebody real special came along and made you believe in something greater than yourself. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2717.9s)]
*  And that's pretty powerful. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2724.9s)]
*  You know, I'm amazed at the way that goodness really works in the world. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2726.9s)]
*  You know, I'm just amazed, man. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2732.9s)]
*  I'm amazed at how many people, you know, I'm feeling in some type of way negative or this or that and somebody comes along and their positivity just shows me the other half of the world that are really the other most of the world that I'm not seeing. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2736.9s)]
*  You know, because if I'm seeing things negatively, it's a lot of that's my choice. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2752.9s)]
*  You know, you walk into hell with a smile, bruh. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2759.9s)]
*  I mean, you could even you might even be able to make the devil think different. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2764.9s)]
*  You know, it's just powerful sometimes to just do that contrary action. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2771.9s)]
*  Oh, it's easy to show up at work and be a dick and do this and that. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2778.9s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2782.9s)]
*  Some guy works for you or you work for your boss. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2784.9s)]
*  He's a dick or you're a dick to show up and just I'm going to try this different. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2786.9s)]
*  What if today I walked up and said, just, hey, look, what you might be the best damn employee or employer. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2792.9s)]
*  They might be the worst. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2800.9s)]
*  And if you said, hey, look, what can I do differently to help the situation here? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2803.9s)]
*  Even if you might already be doing it great. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2808.9s)]
*  But that right there is going to make them think, damn, is the world changing? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2811.9s)]
*  Because I thought my boss or I thought the guy working on them, I thought he was an asshole. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2818.9s)]
*  Wow. The world's changing. It's really the world. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2823.9s)]
*  People are asking, what can they do to help somebody? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2826.9s)]
*  Wow. I better get on that bus because I'm over here on this other shitty bus. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2830.9s)]
*  There's only one other person on it. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2835.9s)]
*  It's a young fellow named Daniel. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2837.9s)]
*  Bernie got a sack full of Gameboys. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2839.9s)]
*  So I don't I got to get on this new bus. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2842.9s)]
*  It's headed in a new direction. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2844.9s)]
*  And that's my perspective. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2847.9s)]
*  And I think I'm sounding a little bit preachy, man. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2849.9s)]
*  I'm sorry about that. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2851.9s)]
*  You know, I've been having my patience has just been real short with myself. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2854.9s)]
*  And I noticed sometimes I get preachy when I'm when I just when I haven't been resting enough, really. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2858.9s)]
*  And when I haven't been at peace enough, I just when I've been too busy, I get more preachy. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2868.9s)]
*  So I'm not trying to preach at you. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2873.9s)]
*  I'm I'm really trying to tell myself that I you know, I want to be brave enough when when a situation is shitty, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2875.9s)]
*  when somebody's done something wrong to me instead of saying, hey, fuck you. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2884.9s)]
*  I want to be able to say, hey, how can I help, man? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2892.9s)]
*  What's going on? You're upset today. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2899.9s)]
*  You need to make it five extra dollars off of me. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=2901.9s)]

*  It's got, you know, one toilet in there. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3224.9s)]
*  It's really for changing kids. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3225.9s)]
*  But all the coworkers go in there and do drugs. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3227.9s)]
*  And I didn't say that. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3229.9s)]
*  And we use it and we do our own business, but it always smells fresh. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3232.9s)]

*  And I used to get me a cold beer and I'd go in the bathroom. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3250.9s)]
*  I was probably 13 or 14. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3254.9s)]
*  And I'd drink him beer out of a damn paper cup. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3256.9s)]
*  And I'd be hitting that Miller Lite, bro. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3259.9s)]
*  And that shit fucking made my cheeks, made it feel like squirrels were living in my neck. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3261.9s)]
*  And they were looking at each other. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3268.9s)]
*  They were looking for each other to fuck, you know. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3270.9s)]
*  That's what it felt like when I drank that Miller Lite as a kid. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3272.9s)]
*  Second, it poured in and it was so spicy and hot in my, and just, I mean, it was ice cold, but it was just hot inside of it. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3275.9s)]
*  It was coldness, but the alcohol had heat in it. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3282.9s)]
*  And it would get in my throat and just let the damn squirrels loose. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3285.9s)]
*  And that shit made me, boy, I'd bite my own ass cheek open if I had two sips of Miller Lite at the age of 13. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3289.9s)]

*  Y'all did the most work in the restaurant, in fact. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3301.9s)]
*  They always keep it smelling great in there. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3304.9s)]
*  You'll go in there, you won't even know the last time that anyone's done some business. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3307.9s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3312.9s)]
*  See, I'll have to hit that Chewies when I'm local. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3313.9s)]

*  And I'd be just eating handfuls of bread pudding straight out of the, uh, like the chef would have made it all. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3333.9s)]
*  But he was cheating on his wife and he was, he was embezzling money. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3340.9s)]
*  So nobody gave a fuck about his recipes, right? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3344.9s)]
*  Because really, I want to know what ingredients have gone into your soul before the, what's in the, uh, in the dessert tray, what you put in there. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3347.9s)]

*  And things can get happen. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3735.9s)]
*  You got water in the house and suddenly, you know, your kids are, you know, they're playing water games or they're doing white water rafting off of the dish cabinet or something. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3736.9s)]
*  You got to make the most of it if you can. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3748.9s)]
*  But I hope everybody's staying safe and put some floaties on. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3751.9s)]
*  Put some floaties on your loved ones when you tuck them in the bed. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3754.9s)]
*  Because Mother Nature, you know, she wants to work with us, but she fiery. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3758.9s)]
*  You know how these matches can be sometimes. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3765.9s)]
*  And she's feisty. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3768.9s)]
*  She's going to flex, man. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3769.9s)]

*  You know, you know, it's so funny. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3776.9s)]
*  I mean, I'm, I think I'm always thinking about this. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3778.9s)]
*  I think everybody's always thinking, are they happy? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3782.9s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3785.9s)]
*  You know, I don't know, man. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3788.9s)]
*  I don't even know if I'm happy with this episode of this podcast. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3790.9s)]
*  I've been feeling overwhelmed recently, man. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3795.9s)]
*  I've been feeling like, you know, a lot of it is I've just been feeling like I, you know, I've used to, I felt before like I knew exactly who I was. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3799.9s)]
*  And then as things have gotten busier with work, sometimes I don't know. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3808.9s)]
*  I still know who I am, but I just need to focus more on, I just, I don't need to focus more, but I just need to do more things of service to be of service, I think. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3815.9s)]
*  I think that'll make me happier. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3826.9s)]
*  You know, on Tuesday, I got a thing I'm going to do movie night over by the Ronald McDonald house. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3829.9s)]
*  And Ronald McDonald, he don't do just burgers, man. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3836.9s)]
*  They do. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3840.9s)]
*  They have a good charitable organization where they house people that have family members that are in ICU and stuff like that. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3841.9s)]
*  And you can go. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3849.9s)]
*  And so they put them up in this hotel that's free. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3851.9s)]
*  And it's and so they have all these families and these children that stay in the hotels while the kids are getting long term care at hospitals. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3854.9s)]
*  So, you know, I decided I was going to go. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3864.9s)]
*  I used to do Tuesday nights over there. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3867.9s)]
*  And so I'm starting back this week. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3869.9s)]
*  So I'm excited about that before King and the Sting. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3871.9s)]
*  We're doing King and the Sting, just a live show. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3874.9s)]
*  It's just me and Brendan. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3876.9s)]
*  But we're doing that live. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3878.9s)]
*  And and we're going to do I'm going to go to the Ronald McDonald house before we do a movie night. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3883.9s)]
*  So I'm excited about that. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3887.9s)]
*  You know, I think I just need to make sure that I focus on doing things that do make me feel good. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3890.9s)]
*  I think I feel a lot of responsibility because I've been given, you know, you get more opportunities. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3896.9s)]
*  You know, as my career has changed in the past year, I feel. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3905.9s)]
*  You know, I feel like I can do more. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3914.9s)]
*  At the same time, I feel like I need to find ways to be happy with what's going on. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3919.9s)]

*  You know, I just I just love seeing people be happy. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3944.9s)]
*  They come out with their wives, people. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3946.9s)]
*  Some people came out their first show. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3948.9s)]
*  They never even been out to a show before this fellow Sebastian, somebody else, this other guy and his brother. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3950.9s)]

*  And I don't feel like, oh, you know, look at me. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3964.9s)]

*  And that kind of stuff does does make me really happy. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3976.9s)]
*  I think the things that I let get into me that make me unhappy are if I start thinking other people should be a certain way, that's the kind of stuff I don't like. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3979.9s)]
*  Like if I if I get caught up, I can too much like thinking about political stuff or, you know, thinking that I know something that that I know more than others. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3988.9s)]
*  Man, I I may have different experiences, but ever, you know, that doesn't mean that I know anything else more. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=3999.9s)]

*  I always want to keep moving the carrot. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4143.9s)]
*  And I think like, you know, I want to be able to, you know, that's why I put I put my mom on the platform. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4148.9s)]

*  It makes me think of my own brother. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4438.9s)]
*  And I'm sure there's a lot of people who live, you know, whoever's listening to this this bullshit right now that are thinking about their brother, man. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4440.9s)]
*  Dude, my brother used to make me listen to all of his music. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4450.9s)]
*  That's the only thing I knew about music. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4453.9s)]
*  It's still only kind of music. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4454.9s)]
*  I really even know people ask me about music. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4456.9s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4459.9s)]
*  I listen to maybe Rodney James, Dio, Tesla. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4461.9s)]
*  You know, I listen to some NWA. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4465.9s)]
*  I listen to I listen to whatever my brother listen to. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4467.9s)]
*  You know, it's funny when you're young and stuff, you just want to be your brother so bad, even if he beats you like, damn, my brother beat my ass. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4473.9s)]
*  But damn, bro, he's awesome. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4480.9s)]
*  You know, you just want to be your brother so bad. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4482.9s)]
*  It's so interesting how that happens at that age. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4486.9s)]
*  You know, it's a special gift. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4490.9s)]
*  You know, it's a special gift. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4491.9s)]
*  And there's a lot of single, you know, not single kids out there, but hopefully there's a ton of single kids out there. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4492.9s)]
*  But but there's a lot of kids, children that, you know, they don't know. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4499.9s)]
*  What am I talking about? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4506.9s)]
*  There's a lot of kids that are. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4507.9s)]
*  Yeah, fuck, I don't know, man. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4510.9s)]
*  But that's nice, dude. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4512.9s)]
*  It's nice that you care about your brother. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4513.9s)]
*  I'm glad that he listens and I'm glad that you listen. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4515.9s)]
*  And I'm glad you guys are out there. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4517.9s)]
*  I'm glad you got a teammate in the world. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4519.9s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4520.9s)]
*  There's a lot of kids that are just their only children. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4521.9s)]
*  And they only children, so they don't really get that opportunity. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4525.9s)]
*  So it's like we all have this different gift, man. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4528.9s)]
*  We all have some people got a gift. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4530.9s)]
*  Some of it's on the inside. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4532.9s)]
*  Some of it's on the outside. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4533.9s)]
*  Some of us have a brother. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4535.9s)]
*  Some of us don't. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4536.9s)]
*  Some of us have a sister. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4537.9s)]
*  Some of us have two children. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4538.9s)]
*  Some of us can't have children. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4540.9s)]
*  Some of us can juggle. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4542.9s)]
*  Some of us can't read. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4543.9s)]
*  Dude, the guy that can't read. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4545.9s)]
*  Oh, yes, sucks a lot at the time. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4546.9s)]
*  But when he walks back by a fucking bookstore and feels no regret, gold mine of comfort. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4548.9s)]
*  There's two sides to the sword. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4558.9s)]
*  You know, there's two sides to every sword, bro. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4562.9s)]
*  And we just, you know, I don't know. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4565.9s)]
*  Fuck. I don't know anything. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4568.9s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4572.9s)]
*  But I know that you care about your brother. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4573.9s)]
*  And that makes me feel good because it made me think about my brother, dude. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4576.9s)]
*  My brother's such a weird guy, bro. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4580.9s)]
*  And he's so hard on himself, too. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4581.9s)]
*  But he's such a loving guy. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4582.9s)]
*  And he tries his best. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4584.9s)]
*  And, you know, and we just he and I were hard on ourselves because we don't, you know, we developed our own sense of what was okay or what wasn't. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4588.9s)]
*  And we didn't, you know, nobody was nobody was hard on us or easy on us. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4594.9s)]
*  And so we didn't know. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4599.9s)]
*  And our brains don't want to leave. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4600.9s)]
*  You know, sometimes if you develop a sense of what you're doing, you know, you're not going to be able to do it. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4602.9s)]
*  If you develop your own thing in your head, that thing can sometimes be mean. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4605.9s)]
*  You know, and but I know, man, my brother's like my you know, he's my idol now. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4610.9s)]
*  And he's not perfect and neat. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4616.9s)]
*  And I'm far from that. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4617.9s)]
*  And we never will be. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4619.9s)]
*  But, you know, we have these little moments and times where, you know, he's just everything I always wanted him to be. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4620.9s)]
*  And I'll never probably fully be able to let him know that. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4628.9s)]
*  I know that. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4631.9s)]
*  But but that's some of my journey. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4632.9s)]
*  You know, I get to be a brother in this lifetime. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4634.9s)]
*  And that's cool. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4637.9s)]
*  You know, I get to call somebody who has the same blood I have in my body in their body and let them know, hey, man, you know, how's that flow going, bro? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4639.9s)]
*  We're riding on a on a risky river, aren't we? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4649.9s)]
*  With this blood is category four rapids right now, ain't it, brother? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4653.9s)]
*  We boil it. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4656.9s)]
*  Or whatever is going on anyway, I'm rambling. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4657.9s)]
*  But thank you guys so much for being a part of this episode. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4663.9s)]
*  Whatever that even means, I feel like it's just sometimes I like going and like turning into like a radio DJ. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4669.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4677.9s)]
*  Congrats to your favor on his win, man. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4679.9s)]
*  I'll say this about your favor, dude. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4681.9s)]
*  I've shaken I bet probably six thousand people's hands in my life. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4683.9s)]
*  The strongest and heaviest hand I've ever shook in my whole life. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4688.9s)]
*  Your eye favors that guy has a damn nineteen pound hand. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4695.9s)]
*  I mean, that guy. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2b-MQGHkxA&t=4703.9s)]
