*  No, I know a lot of folks out there don't really [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=12.68s)]
*  You know the calendar isn't their thing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=17.12s)]
*  They do they just kind of go on time overall [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=20.04s)]
*  you know [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=23.82s)]
*  Start finish, you know, they just [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  They're more that headstone is really their thing. That's their clock [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=27.5s)]
*  They're not on the calendar like we are but if you celebrate February and you believe in it then [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=32.98s)]
*  Then uh, then I'm similar to you and happy February [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=41.86s)]
*  You know, I was thinking when I was growing up they had a fella named Jean [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=52.06s)]
*  Was his name [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=57.14s)]
*  And his name was Eugene [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=59.14s)]
*  But they didn't people didn't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=61.78s)]
*  nobody thought much of them [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=64.02s)]
*  so they just called him Jean because they didn't want to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=66.18s)]
*  You know probably waste the time on the on the you the baguette the extra part of his name [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=69.22s)]
*  They just say I'm calling him Jean, you know [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=73.58s)]
*  this fella ain't worth the time and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=75.94s)]
*  Um and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=80.38s)]
*  He had the thinnest skin, I mean damn you wouldn't even you'd ask him for you cut on a light bulb around him [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=82.22s)]
*  It's skinned is so damn thin you I mean just [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=88.78s)]
*  my god [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=92.42s)]
*  You know, you could see you you could see what was going on [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=94.42s)]
*  You could see his heart. It just pumped and it was heading to his hand and it was heading back [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=98.22s)]
*  You know come to blow you could see it commuting in him. That's how he was just his skin so thin [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=102.94s)]
*  You know if he was gonna get a pimple hell you knew before you could tell in advance you just see it form [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  It just then scan really. I [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=116.9s)]
*  Don't know if maybe his you know [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=120.58s)]
*  When his parents had made love or whatever they didn't really do it good enough or why I don't know what happened [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=123.02s)]
*  You know, I'm not a scientist [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=128.46s)]
*  but um [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=130.9s)]
*  But yeah, you'd see you know armor one time he [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=133.1s)]
*  Tried to do a cigarette and he had to smoke it from so far away [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=136.33999999999997s)]
*  He had to just lean his neck out and get the tip of it because he couldn't get his body that close to the flame [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=140.14s)]
*  Because he'd feel that heat [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  You know, and he was always umbrellaed up people keep him umbrellaed up [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  And so we couldn't do any outdoor sports, you know Jane, you know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  Jean couldn't do no outdoor sports [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=159.78s)]
*  Because the sunlight would just he'd lose before he started [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  You know, he'd be at the starting line. He'd write finish on that bitch and lay down [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=166.1s)]
*  he just couldn't handle the because his skin he only had so much skin and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  that's who he was, you know and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=175.14s)]
*  And everybody thought he wasn't worth much [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=177.7s)]
*  You know, they didn't even call him his full name [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=180.94s)]
*  and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=183.82s)]
*  Then we kind of got to an age. I think it might have been 9 or 11 or even could have been 7 and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=185.54s)]
*  And when swimming was big, you know people's you know [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  Swimming when I was really, you know swimming was just [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=197.5s)]
*  You know, I didn't know anybody that had a pool till I was probably I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=201.66s)]
*  Don't know maybe [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=206.5s)]
*  13 probably anyway swimming came out and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=208.82s)]
*  Jean got in the pool [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=213.17999999999998s)]
*  swimming was indoors and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=215.78s)]
*  So the Sun the elements they weren't out there that wasn't an issue and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=218.5s)]
*  Dude [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  Since he only had a few layers of skin, he probably had three and a half layers of damn skin on him [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=226.46s)]
*  You know, he was just so thin skinned that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=230.82s)]
*  The water, you know because the body is what [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=234.82s)]
*  79% water probably [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=238.66s)]
*  You know, if you if you haven't had anything to eat, I bet it's even a little more than that once you put lunch in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  Your body, I bet it probably drops down about 79% [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=245.94s)]
*  but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=249.98s)]
*  But anyway once he you know, so your body is that much water once Jean got in the pool man [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=252.62s)]
*  dude [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=259.1s)]
*  It was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=260.58s)]
*  He was his skin. There was nothing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=262.5s)]
*  No, there was hardly nothing between him and the water of the pool and the water of his body and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=264.54s)]
*  He was just like a damn I mean [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=270.54s)]
*  Just like a little salamander [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=273.74s)]
*  You know that it just won a damn scratch-off and he was running that bitch back in there. I mean he would just he I [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=276.21999999999997s)]

*  He's that good [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=285.9s)]
*  You know [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=287.86s)]
*  It just took a while sometimes sometimes it takes a while [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=290.42s)]
*  You know, you don't know what [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=295.18s)]
*  You don't know why whatever you're doing why it is or what you have you don't know [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=297.7s)]

*  You don't know why you have it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=311.02s)]
*  You know, you might have one arm and so, you know forever. You're like damn dude [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=313.74s)]

*  Where [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1051.34s)]
*  You know a lot of my ish a lot of my stuff has come from you know, uh [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1054.22s)]
*  I think childhood neglect really [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1058.8600000000001s)]
*  I didn't know when I nobody was really tickling me. Nobody was looking at me and loving me [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1062.06s)]
*  And i'm not complaining [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1068.3s)]
*  You know, it hurts me [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1070.38s)]
*  But i'm not really uh, i'm not here to complain about i'm just telling you what happened [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1072.06s)]
*  So [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1078.3s)]
*  I was home for the holidays [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1079.66s)]
*  And I was down by my mother's house and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1082.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, i've really just been struggling and I had a lot of feelings because i'm off these antidepressants and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1088.0600000000002s)]
*  Um [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1094.38s)]
*  And i've kind of been keeping my distance from my mother I it [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1097.26s)]
*  There's something about the relationship that's been tough for me and I don't know what it was [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1100.94s)]
*  And I just needed some space [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1106.5400000000002s)]
*  um [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1109.1000000000001s)]
*  And I went down to her place and I was sitting there [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1110.78s)]
*  with her [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1113.8999999999999s)]
*  Talking and she giving me a gift [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1115.1s)]
*  and uh [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1117.66s)]
*  And I just broke down man, I bro I was just sobbing I mean just just like damn just like niagara like somebody like some [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  You know like some damn real estate wizard had moved a little you know [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1129.18s)]
*  Eight square inches of niagara from canada right down onto my face in louisiana [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1134.06s)]
*  And i'm just bawling [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1140.78s)]
*  Uh, just really just just suffering honestly just say just [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1143.8999999999999s)]
*  Just a lot of stuff I think from just probably being young I don't know [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1150.1399999999999s)]
*  And uh [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1154.86s)]
*  And my mom she didn't say nothing she didn't come and put her hand on me or say anything [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1158.1399999999999s)]
*  So after a few minutes, I've you know, I got myself together and uh, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1164.54s)]
*  And I asked her I said well dang ma, you know [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1168.6200000000001s)]
*  I said it seemed kind of strange that i'm sitting there really suffering [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1171.5800000000002s)]
*  and um [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1175.42s)]
*  And you didn't check on me, you know [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1177.02s)]
*  and [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1180.0600000000002s)]
*  And she said oh I thought you were just really taken aback by the gift that I got in you [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1185.3400000000001s)]
*  You [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1191.66s)]
*  And it was a nice gift it was like some vitamins or yeah [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1194.6200000000001s)]
*  Vitamins or something it was it was thoughtful. Not i'm not this isn't i'm not judging my mother [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1198.3s)]
*  uh [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1204.8600000000001s)]
*  And i'm not criticizing her [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1205.9s)]
*  But [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1209.1000000000001s)]
*  it just [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1210.7s)]
*  I realized then there's just some disconnect. There's something where she does [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1214.38s)]
*  She did she there's some inability for her to express the type of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1218.3799999999999s)]
*  Affection or attention that I would need from someone in that position [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1226.1399999999999s)]
*  And then it started hitting me that this is the way it had always been my whole life [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1233.58s)]
*  My whole life i've been wanting [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1239.34s)]
*  Just somebody to be there when I suffered or when I was hurting or anything [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1241.58s)]
*  And nobody ever was when I was a child there was no [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1245.9s)]
*  You know, I don't have any memories of being hugged. I don't have any of that kind of stuff [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1249.66s)]
*  from growing up [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1254.0600000000002s)]
*  Uh [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1256.46s)]
*  ever [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1257.98s)]
*  You know and i'd always thought that maybe if I do something if I behave a certain way if I [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1262.6200000000001s)]
*  achieve a certain achievement [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1268.7s)]
*  Then i'll get this will this [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1271.02s)]
*  Is something would change in my relationship [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1273.02s)]
*  um [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1277.42s)]
*  With my mother [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1278.62s)]
*  Who's my biggest fan by the way, I mean she watches the podcast every week and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1283.18s)]
*  You know [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1287.74s)]
*  And I love her for that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1288.94s)]
*  But there's just some there was something that there's some [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1293.34s)]
*  Um [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1296.78s)]
*  And she even sent me a message she texted me later and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1299.74s)]
*  And we spent time over the holidays after that and stuff [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1304.62s)]
*  But it was just a real telling moment for me that man all my life [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1307.02s)]
*  This is how it had been and I always thought there was something wrong with me [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1310.54s)]
*  But there's just some disconnect. She just probably no one had ever done it to her [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1315.26s)]
*  When she was in pain or when she was hurting nobody had ever [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1321.5s)]
*  Taught her, you know had been loving towards her or whatever. I don't know but anyway [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1327.5s)]
*  uh [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1334.3s)]
*  So that was like a wild, you know, that was just a heavy moment and it was a lot of things [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1335.8999999999999s)]
*  it made me [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1341.1s)]
*  Realize that there was nothing I could do anymore [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1343.8999999999999s)]
*  to get [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1347.34s)]
*  There was nothing on earth that I was going to be able to do to get my to get what I needed from my mother [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1349.18s)]
*  And I'd always thought there was [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1354.54s)]
*  I'd always thought if I just get [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1358.1399999999999s)]
*  You know [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1363.34s)]
*  Even with comedy with with everything [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1365.34s)]
*  I thought you know, maybe if I can get everybody in the world to love me [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1369.26s)]
*  Then maybe i'll get my mother to love me [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1375.1s)]
*  Um [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1379.98s)]
*  And it's not that she doesn't she loves me [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1381.58s)]
*  It just [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1385.5s)]
*  the elements that [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1387.42s)]
*  That I need to be loved the way I need to be loved or that a child does [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1390.22s)]
*  No one probably maybe did them to her. I don't know. I'm not judging her or anything. This isn't a judgment [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1394.54s)]
*  um [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1399.98s)]
*  You know, i'm not trying to talk bad about her but it just was uh [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1401.98s)]
*  No one I don't know she doesn't have that a bit it's almost like a blind it is like a blind person [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1407.74s)]
*  They can't see she can't do it [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1412.46s)]
*  She can't do it and it had never been more evident to me and in my whole life [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  I'd never realized it until that moment where i'm sitting there and I am like [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1422.8600000000001s)]
*  Man, I was just really [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1427.58s)]
*  Just bubbly and you know [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1429.82s)]
*  And there was no reaction from her [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1433.26s)]
*  Um or there was no [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1438.14s)]
*  I'm sure she was hurting for me, but [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1440.5400000000002s)]
*  There's just she doesn't have that thing where [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1445.18s)]
*  The ability to comfort [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1448.7s)]
*  You know [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1451.0200000000002s)]
*  Uh, I don't know and some of that i'm still learning. I don't know everything [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1451.9s)]
*  But anyway, so that was a wild thing, you know, and that was a lot because then it made me like a lot of anger [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1456.6200000000001s)]
*  I was like man my whole life [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1463.98s)]
*  this is how it had always been like [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1466.14s)]
*  Everything made so much sense to me now like [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1469.18s)]
*  Why i'd spent my whole life i'd always become such good friends with my [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1474.8600000000001s)]
*  Girlfriend's mothers and with my friends mothers and like I was always looking for this [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1478.84s)]
*  For this thing for this connection that I just had never had [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1488.38s)]
*  Never had [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1492.62s)]
*  You know and it made me even think when I was a little kid that I probably was really struggling and nobody was right there, you know [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1494.6999999999998s)]
*  And maybe that my mother even saw me struggling but didn't have the thing inside whatever that is [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1503.34s)]
*  And I don't think it's a choice that she made I just think it's a it's some it's like almost like an autism [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1511.7399999999998s)]
*  Um [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1519.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like an emotional autism [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1522.3000000000002s)]
*  um [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1525.1000000000001s)]
*  And i'm not judgy, you know, I can't do all this and like [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1527.9s)]
*  You know, there's part of me that'll always be angry and stuff, but i'm not [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1533.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, this isn't about being angry at my mother [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1540.0600000000002s)]
*  um [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1543.3400000000001s)]
*  I can have that time but it's like being angry at somebody who can't uh [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1545.34s)]
*  Who can't eat chocolate or for not eating chocolate, but they don't have a um [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1555.1s)]
*  a mouth or a tongue [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1559.98s)]
*  And so you're sitting there just yelling at them for not eating chocolate [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1563.5s)]
*  But they don't have a mouth or a tongue [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1568.3s)]
*  But they don't have a mouth or a tongue [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1570.94s)]
*  So anyway, that's a lot of information I didn't even know if I really wanted to share that and I don't know, uh [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1575.74s)]
*  I don't know if it's the right thing to share. I never know what the right thing to share is sometimes, you know [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1584.54s)]
*  um [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=1590.1399999999999s)]

*  behind this medication [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2346.44s)]

*  And that was scary [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2439.48s)]
*  I was excited about it because I had a goal [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2442.44s)]
*  Because I didn't know how long I could be out there off those meds without some type of a goal [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2448.84s)]
*  You know, I was going to meetings every day [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2454.12s)]
*  And I really kind of isolated myself over the over the years in some ways [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2459.2400000000002s)]
*  Something inside of me I had made me very angry I was in conflict with a lot of people [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2465.72s)]
*  I mean the reason I did all of this even got off the meds and I was just desperate [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2471.96s)]
*  Man I was desperate for something different. I couldn't honestly I couldn't go on living [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2480.6s)]
*  uh [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2486.6s)]
*  I couldn't go on living like I was living [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2489.48s)]
*  You know and that's scary to think man when your life is going [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2497.08s)]
*  And I mean you look at my life. It would seem to anybody like man [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2499.72s)]
*  And I I I was [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2507.7999999999997s)]
*  In pain, I don't know why exactly i'm not sure i'm still figuring it out [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2510.6s)]
*  But I was in pain I was trying to be as grateful as I could [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2519.08s)]
*  And um [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2523.56s)]
*  But I didn't feel like myself anymore [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2525.24s)]
*  I didn't feel as whimsical. I didn't feel as I didn't feel like myself [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2528.2s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know man, so, you know, I don't know if I should have shared all this and [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2539.0s)]
*  But I want to be able to share my truth, you know and uh [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2548.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2551.72s)]
*  And I gotta realize sometimes my truth is I see other people and they're doing great they seem happy they're doing well and this and that [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2555.8799999999997s)]

*  I want to be them [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2566.2s)]
*  And so sometimes I don't share my truth because [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2569.08s)]
*  I guess because I sometimes I don't know what it is [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  And sometimes i'm afraid that people won't like it if I do share it [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2582.3599999999997s)]
*  Or they'll judge me or [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2587.7999999999997s)]
*  And I don't want to be the person that's always not feeling good [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=2591.8799999999997s)]

*  At some point when I was a child, I wanted to be a girl [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3196.44s)]
*  Uh, because I thought if I was a girl [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3200.6000000000004s)]
*  Then maybe somebody would love me [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3204.2000000000003s)]

*  It's sad to think that there's a child out there who thinks that maybe the thing that's wrong with them is what everything that they are [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3219.88s)]
*  You know and at some point in myself I thought that about myself [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3228.6800000000003s)]
*  I thought that at my very core at my masculinity [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3233.4s)]
*  That I was wrong I was [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3237.7200000000003s)]

*  He sends them over to be there with you [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3314.92s)]
*  And I remember one time I looked up and there was this there was a young woman sitting there with me and just sitting and they don't say anything [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3317.3199999999997s)]
*  They just sit with you [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3324.2s)]
*  And [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3329.0s)]
*  When that happened I brought a dude I un I mean it was like man [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3331.16s)]
*  I really unloaded because [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3337.08s)]
*  All my life [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3340.2s)]
*  I just wanted somebody to be there with me [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3342.2s)]
*  While I hurt [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3345.0s)]
*  I just didn't want to hurt alone [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3351.96s)]
*  I didn't need somebody telling me what to do. I didn't need somebody telling me how to feel [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3355.4s)]
*  I didn't need somebody telling me what would what I could have done better [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3359.96s)]
*  So that I wouldn't have been feeling the way I did [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3364.84s)]
*  Which is probably what I got [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3369.4s)]
*  Which is probably what I got [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3371.96s)]
*  I got a lot of growing up. I got a lot of you need to do these chores [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3374.44s)]
*  You need to do this. You need to do these things. You need to take care of yourself [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3378.2000000000003s)]
*  But I never got any of the [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3382.52s)]
*  I'm here for you [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3385.48s)]
*  No matter what I never got an ounce of it [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3388.6800000000003s)]
*  So when this person came and sat there then I blew up again [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3394.6800000000003s)]
*  Then I blew up again i'm like, oh my god all I ever wanted was somebody to be there with me [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3397.64s)]
*  while I [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3403.7999999999997s)]
*  Wasn't feeling good [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3405.7999999999997s)]
*  And so it's not even adult stuff it's just moments from childhood that are just trapped in you [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3408.6s)]
*  And a lot of those with the ayahuasca, baby, then things come ripping. I mean they are they're like fireworks [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3414.8399999999997s)]
*  They come ripping out of you. What is this plant? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3419.7999999999997s)]

*  You know because I don't want to sound like a wimp [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3453.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's okay, you know, uh [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3457.96s)]
*  You know one thing i've noticed about myself my whole life i've shared [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3462.68s)]
*  I've just i've needed affection. I've needed some [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3467.3199999999997s)]
*  Attention i've needed people to care [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3471.2999999999997s)]
*  because I didn't have it and so [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3473.8799999999997s)]
*  Anything has been negotiable for me in a weird way over my life [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3477.08s)]
*  Um [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3481.24s)]
*  And some of this I want to share because I know there's a lot of guys out there that kind of struggle with similar stuff [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3484.12s)]
*  that I do [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3488.2s)]
*  you know, I see it in their eyes when we meet after the shows or we meet before the shows or [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3490.12s)]
*  People that come up to me and say hey, you know, I see it [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3494.92s)]
*  Uh, I don't think i'm a rare case in the world or nothing like that [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3498.36s)]
*  You know, uh [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3506.92s)]
*  And look, I know that a lot of this is all over the place it's it's still all over the place for me [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3508.68s)]
*  Um, that was about two three weeks ago and i'm going again in a week and a half to do it again [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3514.52s)]
*  um [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3522.44s)]
*  I've had friends tell me that they did it a certain number of times and then they never needed to do antidepressants again [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3525.08s)]
*  I don't know if i'll be able to get there [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3532.04s)]
*  You know, I think uh [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3536.52s)]
*  You know, I don't know i'm trying [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3539.64s)]
*  so [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3542.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, that would be nice [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3544.12s)]
*  But if not, then maybe i'll i'll have to get back on something and that's okay, too [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3546.52s)]
*  None of this is a judgment if anybody's on a pill or anything look [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3551.24s)]
*  Part of me still doesn't know whether if I should have just got onto a different pill or something but [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3556.6s)]
*  I don't know if I had another choice the [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3561.72s)]
*  The [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3563.96s)]
*  The pain inside of me was it was coming out of me it was breaking through it was like I was angry I was miserable and [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3565.8s)]
*  And I don't know if I'll be able to fix myself, I don't know [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3575.08s)]
*  But [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3579.8s)]
*  I feel like i'm out here. I feel like literally whenever they drop that astronaut off on the machine up there [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3581.48s)]
*  Whatever it is some satellite and he's got to fix it or whatever. They give him a wrench or whatever. That's how I feel [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3586.68s)]
*  I feel like i'm out trying to fix this [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3594.36s)]
*  You know, uh, but i'm now i'm working with another therapist i'm doing emdr therapy [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3600.6s)]
*  um [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3606.2s)]
*  And I tried a lot when I look back in my history i've tried a lot of stuff to feel better [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3608.76s)]
*  I've tried a lot of recovery. I've tried different 12 step programs. I've tried [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3612.52s)]
*  Ketamine, um, i've tried yoga. I've tried different medications. I've tried [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3617.78s)]
*  Like a [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3623.96s)]
*  Uh gut biome thing like um, uh [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3626.44s)]
*  So i'm proud of myself for trying [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3632.92s)]
*  I'm proud of myself for trying bro [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3636.36s)]
*  You know, i'm no soft boss dog. Another thing I got into in the past month was uh, jujitsu [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3639.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's been helping [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3647.16s)]
*  That's been helping because you know, I never had a father growing up and this isn't a woe is me [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3649.3999999999996s)]
*  There's people's stories out there that are oh [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3655.3999999999996s)]
*  That are really harrowing [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3658.7599999999998s)]
*  But the only story I have is my own [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3661.08s)]
*  Um [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3664.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's okay if my life doesn't fit, you know [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3667.48s)]
*  Everybody whatever every other people are doing, you know, uh [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3673.24s)]
*  I can't pretend anymore. I'm not where i'm at [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3677.56s)]
*  You know, um, because it's not fair to me either [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3684.68s)]
*  It's not fair to me either to not to per to be somewhere that i'm not really at sometimes [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3692.92s)]
*  Um [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3703.24s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean a lot of other stuff on the ayahuasca like your [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3705.4s)]
*  Your inner child is right there. So you see all these things you you did as a kid to set yourself up for success [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3709.8s)]
*  So one thing I realized was like as an adult if like as a child [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3718.52s)]
*  I took a lot of l's like I set myself up like I went through a lot of [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3722.92s)]
*  grueling moments by myself [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3727.78s)]
*  So I could be successful later [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3731.32s)]
*  And so [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3733.4s)]
*  I'm living my childhood his dreams. I'm living my those are my kids dreams that i'm living right now [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3736.2000000000003s)]
*  They're not really my adult dreams. They're my but my childhood dreams i'm living his dreams [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3743.32s)]
*  And when I look at that it gives it puts my life in a little bit of a different space [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3750.76s)]
*  um [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3756.6800000000003s)]
*  It makes me really proud of who I was as a kid [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3759.3199999999997s)]
*  Which is different for me because I never felt proud [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3768.6s)]
*  All I ever felt was if I do something different or what can I do differently to be loved [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3774.3599999999997s)]
*  I was loved [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3781.4199999999996s)]
*  That's all I ever felt [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3788.54s)]
*  And so then the only way I developed any sense of myself was by reactions to what I did [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3796.62s)]
*  So if I started getting loved by people then that's who I was [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3804.06s)]
*  I was whatever [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3808.7s)]
*  I ever had [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3811.18s)]
*  I needed to be to be loved [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3812.94s)]
*  And somewhere along the way some of me didn't really develop because I didn't know who I was [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3820.7s)]
*  I don't know if I felt safe to be out in the world. I probably [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3829.58s)]
*  You know [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3833.5s)]
*  I'm sure at a really young age. It wasn't real. I didn't feel safe [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3835.4199999999996s)]
*  I felt like whoever I was [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3839.6600000000003s)]
*  It wasn't okay to be that because I wasn't getting the return that I needed [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3844.94s)]
*  Um [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3850.3s)]
*  And it was a lot of pressure on my mother my dad was you know [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3852.2200000000003s)]
*  A senior city who's all he wasn't around and that was very scary and [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3854.7000000000003s)]
*  you know a lot of shit like that, but I i'm not trying to get into all that again, but [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3858.54s)]
*  um [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3862.94s)]
*  I [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3864.94s)]
*  But yeah, so i'm i'm just kind of on this journey i'm still in the middle of it [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3869.02s)]
*  And [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3877.5s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes i'm ashamed i'm not ashamed I just it's scary for me to share some of it, uh [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3880.3s)]
*  Because i'm scared I think of what people will think I don't you know [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3895.7400000000002s)]
*  Which is what i've always been my whole life [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3901.18s)]
*  Probably i'm scared of what people think of me [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3904.7000000000003s)]
*  If i'm myself, you know [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3909.98s)]
*  But some cool, you know a lot of neat stuff and uh a lot of adventurous stuff and [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3915.58s)]
*  You know, because I would like to be able to have a family [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3920.78s)]
*  I want to be able to fall in love one day and have a family and some of that [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJB8B7l4Ow&t=3922.62s)]
