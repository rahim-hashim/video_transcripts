*  I'm here for lump. I'm not here to work, you know [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=631.76s)]
*  But [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm here for lump. I'm not here to work, you know [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=636.48s)]
*  Like that's how strange it's getting that they're just if you're even in a place [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  They're asking you to work. It feels like [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  Which is exciting, I mean at least it's great and I and you know [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  I guess i'm lucky that I don't have to take that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=652.72s)]
*  That you know 30 minutes. I don't need that employment at that half hour mark [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=655.44s)]
*  but um [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  but damn it's just [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=661.44s)]
*  It feels like the wild I don't feel like the wild west [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=663.7600000000001s)]
*  Ah [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=669.7600000000001s)]
*  And then where is everybody that's another thing you're like if nobody's working [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=672.4000000000001s)]
*  Where is what's going on? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=684.6400000000001s)]
*  And then you start thinking are people bots? Are you running into bots? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  bots [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=690.24s)]
*  You know, I watch people when they get in their car a lot of times if they're leaving me because [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=693.04s)]
*  That's when I figure a bot [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=698.08s)]
*  Would have the toughest time [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=700.48s)]
*  Because there's a lot of little intricacies when you get into a vehicle [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  And I don't think a bot could do that real easily [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=707.84s)]
*  You know, you could easily see a bot like, oh, I like the sunglasses, you know [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=711.44s)]
*  But [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=716.96s)]
*  If you're running into like a bot human, I think if you watch them get in their car [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=718.0s)]
*  They would have to really do it good [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=721.84s)]
*  I'm happy. I'm [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=725.2s)]
*  It's tuesday, you know [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=727.2s)]
*  So, I don't know. I it's just getting everything feels strange out there [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=729.92s)]
*  And it feels kind of lawless [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=734.24s)]
*  You know, it feels lawless. It feels like the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=737.44s)]
*  You know people are just running red lights. It doesn't you know, it's like [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=740.72s)]
*  Fucking i'm running red light. I mean i'm running stops. It's just like people are doing what they want [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=746.08s)]
*  That's what it feels like it feels like people are just doing what they want [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=751.28s)]
*  um [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=756.48s)]
*  And I don't know maybe that's just [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=758.96s)]
*  And it could just be my area [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=762.08s)]
*  You know, um [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=764.8s)]
*  But we have like the police living fear they're afraid it feels like to do their jobs [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=767.6s)]
*  uh [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=772.56s)]
*  I don't know a lot of fear out there [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=773.92s)]
*  a lot of fear out there, um [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=776.24s)]
*  And i'm sure you know that i'm not trying to be a downer [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=778.96s)]
*  Just kind of saying I guess what's been happening. Um [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=781.92s)]
*  Are just things i've been thinking about [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=786.32s)]
*  What else dude? I went to the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=788.88s)]
*  I went with david spade over to the oscars, uh after parties [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=791.44s)]
*  And that was interesting [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=796.48s)]
*  You know and fuck oscars man, you know, yeah, you know, I don't like all of that shit [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=799.04s)]
*  You know, I don't like hollywood [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=803.68s)]
*  or much of it and um [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=806.0s)]
*  But getting to go with him and stuff like that was real interesting [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=809.68s)]
*  And I was overhead at his house. We watched the oscars at uh at david's home [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=814.88s)]
*  and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=820.4s)]
*  They had the you know, the chris rock got hit [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=822.24s)]
*  And I was thinking about that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=826.64s)]
*  and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=829.44s)]
*  I think there was [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=831.28s)]
*  So many people have talked about it right that and that's that is what it is [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=833.12s)]
*  but I think there was like a um [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=837.76s)]
*  There was like a moment where? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=841.44s)]
*  part of the anger [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=844.32s)]
*  Was that here you have somebody who's just saying something right chris rock [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=846.88s)]
*  Now I get he's jabbing at the guy's wife. I get that [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=851.28s)]
*  um [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=855.12s)]
*  But also he's a comedian [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=856.32s)]
*  He should be able to do that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=859.12s)]
*  Or he should be able to take his risks and I felt like it was a calculated risk. It felt super safe [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=860.96s)]
*  um [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  But there was something about how you saw [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=869.76s)]
*  A guy walk up because he didn't like what somebody else said [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=874.24s)]
*  Or for whatever reason it's hard to really know the reason that will smith had in his head [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=879.2s)]
*  People said all kind of stuff. He was gaying out or he was gayed out [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  People said his wife was you know, they have a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=889.5999999999999s)]
*  um [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  you know, they do a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=895.76s)]
*  Foster cocking or whatever or when people can make love to your wife, you know foster cocks. I don't know what it is [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=898.88s)]
*  They do foster cocks [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=905.76s)]
*  Uh, or cock fostering. I don't know what it is. I don't i'm not i'm not gonna look it up either because I have a blocker on my [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=907.76s)]
*  computer but um [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=914.64s)]
*  Yeah, so they said uh, so anyway, but there was a guy who said something and then you saw somebody [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=917.36s)]
*  A rich guy on another rich guy [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=923.92s)]
*  Come and hit him [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=927.52s)]
*  And then get an award for it [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=930.72s)]
*  And it just kind of felt like this is what it this was this where I ended up really feeling the most anger at the end [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=934.96s)]
*  of it all [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=940.16s)]
*  Was it was just really towards hollywood towards the oscars towards the whole fucking machine of all that shit [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=942.24s)]
*  It was like hey [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=950.64s)]
*  We if somebody can hit somebody else they can do whatever they want [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=953.04s)]
*  They could say this man can speak or not speak [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=958.24s)]
*  So and we'll we'll give that guy an award [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=961.1999999999999s)]
*  And then this is the craziest part [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=966.4s)]
*  All of hollywood will stand there and applaud the guy [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=970.08s)]
*  As if the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=975.04s)]
*  The [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=977.68s)]
*  The fucked up thing he did didn't even happen [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=980.08s)]
*  And it was kind of like a microcosm I think of everything that's been going on, you know [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=984.5600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=990.88s)]
*  So many people feel like their reality is neglected by hollywood [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  that uh [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=997.36s)]
*  since hollywood owns a lot of the media and and mainstream media that they just [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=999.28s)]
*  uh [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1004.4s)]
*  They just [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1006.0799999999999s)]
*  That they're so powerful that if they want to act like something didn't happen they can just brush right over it [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1008.48s)]
*  Which they do all the time pick and choose what they think [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  um [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  Or when they think something is important or what they think is important [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1022.16s)]
*  Uh [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1026.4s)]
*  So I think there was a lot of that in there for me [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1028.48s)]
*  And I hope chris rock sues the oscars. I would sue the oscars. I would sue everybody in that bitch [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1032.08s)]
*  You know [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1038.08s)]
*  um [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1039.28s)]
*  That's what I would do [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1040.48s)]
*  Because yeah, they just that that's what it was for me it was like [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1043.52s)]
*  Here's this powerful machine saying once again [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1047.36s)]
*  Oh, we determine how [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1052.0s)]
*  If the way you see things is real or not almost [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1056.56s)]
*  Or we think we determine it [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1062.08s)]
*  Because we all saw somebody hit somebody and then [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1066.4s)]
*  Get an award then give an insane speech and get a standing ovation [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1071.6s)]
*  It was like they were trying to make us believe that it didn't happen [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1075.68s)]
*  In a way [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1081.84s)]
*  Which goes along with the whole pandemic thing there's that all of that ties in there like oh you're gonna make me [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1083.9199999999998s)]
*  You're really trying to bend me out of the fact that reality is happening [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1093.52s)]
*  So anyway, that's kind of where some of that landed for me and maybe that's obtuse kind of and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1101.04s)]
*  But maybe it's not dude. I'm just here for limes [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1107.4399999999998s)]

*  Uh, just uncertainty [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1320.8s)]

*  Even just the smallest ones [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1327.76s)]
*  It's like [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1329.76s)]
*  Man, i'll just i'm just so afraid something inside of me so afraid to decide [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1331.76s)]
*  Inside [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1336.8s)]
*  And I don't know if it's i'm afraid that i'll make the wrong choice [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1339.6s)]
*  Um [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1347.12s)]
*  As much as it is maybe there's just part of me that's just afraid to [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1349.6s)]
*  Commit [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1354.48s)]
*  I don't know [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1359.52s)]
*  I'm just kind of thinking about that [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1361.84s)]
*  If it's one or the other, you know [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  Am I afraid to commit or am I just afraid to decide? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1367.52s)]
*  If i'm afraid of making the wrong choice or am I afraid of committing [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1374.72s)]

*  So i've been struggling with that a lot [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1391.84s)]
*  You know, i've been feeling kind of a little bit unsafe and uncertain in the world [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1394.24s)]
*  And so maybe that also adds to the fact of uh [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1401.04s)]
*  Of me feeling like the world is all over the place [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  um [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1412.08s)]
*  And some of that I think you know, i'm still off my i'm still not taking antidepressants, so i'm still trying to uh [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  To stay off of them [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1421.76s)]
*  You know what i'm gonna I guess just keep seeing how that can work or not [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1424.24s)]
*  um [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1428.08s)]
*  you know i'm in contact with doctors and [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1429.76s)]

*  Because I don't want I just I really don't want to go back on them [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1439.6s)]

*  and [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1455.68s)]
*  I think part of me has really been enjoying [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1457.68s)]
*  Getting some of that out of my system [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=1462.56s)]

*  Ayahuasca is [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2274.5600000000004s)]
*  Ayahuasca is like a key I think it's like an invitation [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2280.0s)]
*  In [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2286.58s)]
*  You take it you sit there [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2291.46s)]
*  You're meditating [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2295.86s)]
*  There's no party about it there's nothing like uh, we're gonna do this in a back room at a party that's not [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2299.54s)]
*  now you can still do it in a back room, but [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2305.7s)]
*  It's more of a experience [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2309.7s)]
*  And it's a longer experience [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2313.38s)]
*  And it's really [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2317.54s)]
*  You start to learn about yourself [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2320.42s)]
*  You learn some truths about yourself [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2324.18s)]
*  You know, I was sitting there and I mean [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2327.94s)]
*  People are like did you go to peru? Did you go to you know, miamara or whatever? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2330.58s)]
*  Like dude, I did that shit right off the 101 bro. I did that I was I was probably [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2336.1s)]
*  180 yards from a papas [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2342.64s)]
*  Chicken [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2345.6s)]
*  You know in a dsw shoes, dude, I could see there were moments in some of my visions and stuff that somebody who you know [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  you know walk by with a damn pair of birkenstocks on so [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2353.6s)]
*  I was [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2357.52s)]
*  You know, I wasn't out in the abyss but the environment I was in was really nice [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2359.2s)]
*  Uh in the sense that it was it had a great shaman and great people doing it [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2363.7599999999998s)]
*  And i'm sitting in there and you take the meds you take the medicines and [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2369.6s)]
*  It's almost like your heart starts to dream or think [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2375.44s)]
*  And it's really wild because you start to get thoughts that come out of your [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2382.64s)]
*  It's almost like they come out of the time that's trapped inside of you [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2390.08s)]
*  It's like your heart gets a brain [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2399.6s)]
*  You know, I remember sitting there and uh [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2405.44s)]
*  And you just start to go it's like [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2413.12s)]
*  It's like a best friend shows up [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2416.16s)]
*  And starts to share stuff with you that you're willing to hear [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2418.48s)]
*  because you um [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2422.4s)]
*  Usually because you've been suffering with something [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2425.68s)]
*  You know [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2428.8799999999997s)]
*  uh [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2430.0s)]
*  And so it starts to kind of unearth some of that [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2431.2s)]
*  And you go through the different experiences and you're like man that was a lot, you know [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  I learned a lot of stuff about myself [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2438.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like therapy, but you don't have to do a lot of the heavy lifting [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2440.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's like the goddess, you know the [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2446.24s)]
*  Like god brings the wood right up to you, you know, the firewood you don't have to go out and chop [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2450.48s)]
*  You just open the door and it's all firewood. You can't even see the world. It's just [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2456.24s)]
*  All your firewood is right there [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2460.4s)]
*  And god has chopped it for you [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2462.4s)]
*  And so you could so at that point it's really an invitation. It's like how much do you want to know? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2465.04s)]
*  That's what it feels like to me how much do you want to know [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2471.76s)]
*  My last experience man, I went and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, i'd really been struggling with a lot of stuff about my mother [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2481.76s)]
*  Uh and my relationship with my mother [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2484.1600000000003s)]
*  And my inability to do anything [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2488.1600000000003s)]
*  And my inability to have a connection with my mother a deep connection [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2490.96s)]
*  you know, I'd always wanted it and um [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2495.92s)]
*  And so i'm sitting there under the ayahuasca and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2500.4s)]
*  And i've always struggled in relationships commitment. I've really always struggled [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2504.08s)]
*  And [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2510.24s)]
*  While i'm under this ayahuasca while i'm in the experience of the medication [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2512.4s)]
*  I realized that the reason I have trouble getting into a relationship or being committed [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2516.64s)]
*  Uh, well, there's two reasons one [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2522.7200000000003s)]
*  Is that part of me is still waiting for this relationship with my mother to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2525.36s)]
*  really [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2530.7200000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2532.88s)]
*  Come through [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2534.56s)]
*  There's part of me that's still like this young kid that's still just standing there waiting [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2536.8s)]
*  for his mother [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2541.6800000000003s)]
*  to really [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2543.52s)]
*  Connect with him [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2545.04s)]
*  Um [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2547.36s)]
*  And so it's really hard for me to make another commitment to another woman. It's really hard for me [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2549.44s)]
*  uh [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2557.12s)]
*  And I didn't know it was because there's a part of me that's still just literally standing there waiting [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2559.12s)]
*  And that sounds kind of crazy, but [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2565.76s)]
*  When you're under the medication it makes a lot of sense [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2568.8s)]
*  Because it really activates the inner child in you [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2572.2400000000002s)]
*  And you really get to see what the [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2578.4s)]
*  Very young you the formative you what he what he or she went through [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2581.92s)]
*  Um [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2587.76s)]
*  And you see why they went through it and how it affected them and then how that affects you now [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2589.84s)]
*  It's almost like as an adult you're a plant [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  But on ayahuasca you get to go back to the seed [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2602.0s)]
*  And you get to look in the seed [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2607.6000000000004s)]
*  And the seed gets to communicate the seed communicates with you the you the you the early you the formative you [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  um [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2619.76s)]
*  but so it's a lot different in that sense you really get to sit there and [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2621.36s)]
*  and [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2625.36s)]
*  And be with a lot of the things that have made you uncomfortable, but now you're able to see okay [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2627.28s)]
*  This is why I behave this way as an adult [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2632.6400000000003s)]
*  Because this happened when I was young [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2635.52s)]
*  And you always can kind of [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  In therapy sometimes you'll talk about those things but to really have a real connection between them [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2640.6400000000003s)]
*  And to really feel that connection is pretty powerful [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2646.0800000000004s)]
*  Uh [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2650.5600000000004s)]
*  and also [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2652.0800000000004s)]
*  it's a it's a [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2653.6000000000004s)]
*  It's an invitation in a way because ayahuasca is an invitation [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2654.96s)]
*  Because it's really how much of that stuff do you want to learn and go into? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2659.92s)]
*  Because it feels like there's a lot of it [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2665.2s)]
*  My second experience I sat there for probably [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2668.16s)]
*  Oh, I can't even tell you. I mean just tons of time. I mean just I mean I was just grieving just crying [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2671.76s)]
*  I was grieving like um [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2679.2s)]
*  You know when I was 12 or 10 my brother [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2681.6s)]
*  he got to go live with my grandparents and [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2685.12s)]
*  That sounds like a small thing but that broke my heart [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2689.04s)]
*  It broke my heart as a kid [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2694.0s)]
*  That my mother let him go [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2697.2s)]
*  It brought I mean it really [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2700.08s)]
*  Because he was the closest thing that I felt to uh to love you know or to a real [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2702.56s)]
*  Friend or something and [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2708.56s)]
*  And he was my mother and she let him go [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2711.2s)]
*  Just do what he wanted like he was an adult it just was and that shit broke my heart man, so [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2716.48s)]
*  But there's a lot of things inside of you that you've been resilient through [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2722.24s)]
*  And but you're able to go and look at those things and let [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2727.44s)]
*  Kind of let the air out of some of those balloons, you know [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2730.88s)]
*  It's like your soul gets to fart kind of [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2734.32s)]
*  You know you're able to go and unpack a lot of these things that really could have really and [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2736.88s)]
*  Probably had a big effect on your life and how you behave now [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2743.36s)]
*  So anyway, it's tough because it's hard for me to go into some of that [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2748.4s)]
*  You know a lot of it's real painful I went and spoke with my mom after the holidays about uh [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2754.48s)]
*  You know about some about [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2761.8399999999997s)]
*  A lot of the feelings I was having [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2764.48s)]
*  and I you know and about how much I felt neglected really and [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2766.96s)]
*  And it was hard man, I'm glad I was able to give myself a voice but it was it was it was tough [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2774.16s)]
*  Because it was also a long time ago, you know and um [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2780.56s)]
*  And so you don't want to damage the person you're talking to or upset you [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2785.52s)]
*  You know, you don't but you do want to share what's going on [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2789.28s)]
*  And what you're feeling and learning [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2794.5600000000004s)]
*  So that's ayahuasca man. If you want ayahuasca, you're going to go down a real [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2797.52s)]
*  Or you could go down [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2803.0400000000004s)]
*  You know a real [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2805.44s)]
*  rabbit hole [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2807.76s)]
*  A real invitation to say okay how much [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2810.2400000000002s)]
*  Because you can keep going and doing it [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2813.44s)]
*  And that's where i'm at now. I'm not going to go back and do it [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2815.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's where i'm at now. I don't know if I want to go back sometimes [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2818.4s)]
*  right now [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2822.32s)]
*  I mean the the the [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2826.0s)]
*  The last time I went man, it was it was cathartic [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2828.08s)]
*  But it was damn painful, man [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2832.08s)]
*  It was painful. It was cathartic in the way you sit there and you know [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2835.04s)]
*  You [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2840.88s)]
*  You cry for the things that you get those tears all the shit that's in you get it out [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2842.56s)]
*  You get it out you cook it right up out of your system [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2848.4s)]
*  Um [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2852.56s)]
*  But it's a lot of work. I mean it is it's the hardest thing i've ever had to do [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2854.0s)]
*  It's like I [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2861.76s)]
*  you know, I would imagine it's like boot camp or something but for your [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2863.84s)]
*  For your heart and for your soul and stuff. So [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2868.7200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2873.6s)]
*  I don't know if that does a good job of explaining it [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2875.2s)]
*  But that's some of the differences I noticed between them. One of them is a real [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2877.12s)]
*  One of them is like going to a carnival [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2881.68s)]
*  And the other one is like [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2885.2s)]
*  Going to [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2892.16s)]
*  It's like going into an ocean [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2897.9199999999996s)]
*  So [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2900.8s)]
*  That's my thoughts on the difference between I think DMT and ayahuasca is ayahuasca can really [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2905.28s)]
*  It can really I mean DMT shows you that [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2913.52s)]
*  You know DMT is like kind of like a firework kind of but ayahuasca is a damn fucking [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=2918.56s)]

*  My main thought really is is this woman going to be a good mother [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3433.22s)]
*  I think I mean I have I have obviously other some attraction things, you know [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3440.42s)]

*  So those are a couple things i'll bring my list in [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3468.9s)]
*  um [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3472.02s)]
*  and [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3473.86s)]
*  But those are a couple things that I think about [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3475.22s)]
*  You know, I look in a woman's eyes a lot of times [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3478.18s)]
*  And you can see [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3481.06s)]
*  And when I look at their eyes, I think if I was a child would I like looking at that woman's eyes? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3482.8999999999996s)]
*  And that uh [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3490.1s)]
*  I know that my wife will have that it may sound crazy to some people but [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3493.7s)]
*  The childhood I had didn't have that comfort in it [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3498.74s)]
*  um, I didn't have that comfort when I [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3502.02s)]
*  I didn't have that comfort when I [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3504.1s)]
*  You know from my mother from her look and so I want my child to have that [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3507.14s)]
*  And so that's one thing that I kind of look for I think [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3512.66s)]
*  so yeah, somebody with no eyes probably or [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3516.2599999999998s)]
*  that [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3520.42s)]

*  At least if your brother or father teaches you to masturbate then at least it feels like it's a [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3825.06s)]
*  It's okay. It's normalized [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3831.06s)]
*  Recessed whereas if you're secretly doing it behind a big rock in the desert or something or [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8TKU65sbc&t=3833.22s)]
