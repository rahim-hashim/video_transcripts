*  We hit about, I think, 200 something miles an hour. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=386.44s)]
*  I mean, I could fucking I could taste the enamel in the back of my throat from my own teeth, bro. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=389.44s)]
*  That shit really should clear your sinuses, bro. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=396.44s)]
*  High speed. What else we got to we went down to Joe Rogan came on the podcast. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=400.44s)]
*  If you didn't hear that episode, that was pretty cool. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=407.44s)]
*  That was really pretty cool, man. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=409.44s)]
*  He he had texted me and invited me to go on his show. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=412.44s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, thanks. I'd love to come. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=417.44s)]
*  And then I was like, well, I know I got a space on mine that week. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=420.44s)]
*  I said and I was kind of nervous to text, but I was like, maybe you should. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=423.44s)]
*  We'd love to have you on ours. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=428.44s)]
*  And so that was exciting. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=430.44s)]
*  I got to go and do that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=434.44s)]
*  Bobby Lee came on that beautiful little unagi, bro, that little that little Vietnam survivor, you know. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=437.44s)]
*  And sometimes, boy, I fucking just. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=449.44s)]
*  That little ponzu little muppet someone that is one man, I'll take that do I'll drop him off at every damn VFW in America [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=453.44s)]
*  and let some old boys in there finish up on him. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=461.44s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=464.44s)]
*  Ewo, Jim, my daddy. Praise God, brother. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=466.44s)]
*  What else has been happening with me? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=472.44s)]
*  Oh, we got to shoot a film. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=476.44s)]
*  We shot a movie or a film. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=478.44s)]
*  Film movie film movie. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=483.44s)]
*  We shot we shot that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=487.44s)]
*  That was interesting. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=488.44s)]
*  You know, at first, I didn't really want to do it because it's a lot of time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=491.44s)]
*  It's just a lot of time. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=498.44s)]
*  And I don't like giving up my time, honestly. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=500.44s)]
*  It's a pretty selfish way to be. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=507.44s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=509.44s)]
*  So sometimes you have to do it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=510.44s)]
*  But I don't like sometimes I just want to keep I kind of, you know, I want to keep my time to myself. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=512.44s)]
*  You know, I keep my time all in like a little, you know, I'm that little second Santa. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=519.44s)]
*  I got all my seconds in a bag on my back, baby. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=525.44s)]
*  And I might, you know, you know, take that satchel off and get a minute out to somebody. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=528.44s)]
*  Give seven, eight minutes to a little dime, a little dame, little beauty over there. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=534.44s)]
*  Maybe give, you know, four or five minutes to your boy over there. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=540.44s)]
*  But otherwise, I like to keep my time to myself. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=544.44s)]
*  So for me, that was a new experience just saying, OK, I don't know what this is going to be like. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=549.44s)]
*  I'm going to commit to doing it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=553.44s)]
*  And so and I was glad that I did. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=557.44s)]
*  We just had a nice time. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=559.44s)]
*  I got to do like this kind of like not fighting scene, but it was like this kind of like like wrestling kind of scene with Johnny Knoxville. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=563.44s)]
*  And. And that was, you know, I thought it would be all harm. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=572.44s)]
*  I'm thinking like, all right, how do I look like angry? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=578.44s)]
*  But I'm I'm fighting or I'm, you know, you know, do I make like a face? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=580.44s)]
*  And I'm just thinking of all this like, what will I do? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=586.44s)]
*  You know, well, you know, do I have to be real? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=589.44s)]
*  Do I need to, you know, call somebody and, you know, call him a bitch or something first? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=593.44s)]
*  Or will I just feel angry? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=597.44s)]
*  Like, how will I make it all work? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=599.44s)]
*  And we got there and it just everything rolled out pretty cool. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=601.44s)]
*  You know, I didn't I didn't I didn't. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=606.44s)]
*  Overanalyze it too much, just did it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=613.44s)]
*  And Bobby Lee was there, so that made it a lot of fun just getting to be around him every day. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=616.44s)]
*  Because he's newly single. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=622.44s)]
*  You know, we saw he he and his lady. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=624.44s)]
*  You know, they went their separate ways. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=627.44s)]
*  And so he's, you know, I mean, he's most of the day he's on the just. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=630.44s)]
*  Hunting leg on the phone and Internet. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=636.44s)]
*  I mean, damn, that dude, he had people he had put some calling out on his social media on his podcast for, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=641.44s)]
*  you know, I guess women ascend in pictures of tits and, you know, cooter or whatever booty booty cooter, all of it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=650.44s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=658.44s)]
*  And damn men were sending him stuff. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=661.44s)]
*  And so he didn't know until each time he click on the picture and sometimes it's a damn, you know, that, you know, it just be one long tit, you know, with some nuts on it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=663.44s)]
*  Like, damn, bro. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=672.44s)]

*  That thing, that thing's a that's a unique looking tit. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=676.44s)]
*  Because he was getting sent everything. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=681.44s)]
*  But that was a nice experience. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=684.44s)]
*  I'm glad that I did it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=685.44s)]
*  And what else, man? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=689.44s)]
*  We went. Oh, I went and visited my brother out there in Utah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=691.44s)]
*  And it was in southern Utah, right by Mount Zion Park. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=695.44s)]
*  And it is I mean, it's it is beautiful, man. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=701.44s)]
*  It's like Mother Nature's, you know, whatever it's called strip club. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=707.44s)]
*  I mean, if she got her finest everything, it just every mountain, every mountain hill, every little thing, it just damn is fine as hell, bro. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=715.44s)]
*  You know, you just want to suck your own nuts, bro. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=726.44s)]
*  It's just it's just that kind of place, Mount Zion, if you get a chance to go there. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=729.44s)]
*  And my brother had moved out there. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=735.44s)]
*  He lives in Springville or Springdale right outside of the park or Rockville. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=737.44s)]
*  And he we had some fresh raccoon. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=743.44s)]
*  He shot a couple of coons out there. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=747.44s)]
*  And so we had some fresh raccoon squirrel dove. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=750.44s)]
*  I'd eaten dove before. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=756.44s)]
*  You know, when I was young, I had a couple of brothers that live by the apartments and they grilled up a couple of doves one time for Mother's Day. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=760.44s)]
*  And I had some of that with them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=769.44s)]
*  What else? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=772.44s)]
*  What else did we do? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=775.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's just kind of what's been going on. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=777.44s)]
*  I just thank you guys for staying supportive of the cast and keeping and keeping things going. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=779.44s)]
*  I still got my sober days going right now. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=786.44s)]
*  I have let me see. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=788.44s)]
*  Feeling pretty good. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=790.44s)]
*  Look on my little app. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=792.44s)]
*  I have one hundred fifty six days. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=794.44s)]
*  So that's been nice to just, you know, feel a part of something. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=798.44s)]
*  Yeah, and it's been interesting, man, and going to those meetings and stuff, you know, and just hearing other people talk honestly. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=808.44s)]
*  You know, sometimes. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=820.44s)]
*  When other people speak real, real honestly about themselves, about what's going on with them, it allows me to think honestly about what's going on with me. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=825.44s)]
*  It's like sometimes I can't really. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=837.44s)]
*  It's hard for me to get a clear perception of myself or to think really like real clearly unless there's but sometimes in the recovery meeting, if somebody sharing real honestly about what's going on with them, then I can. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=839.44s)]
*  I don't know. My brain just feels or my emotions just feel safe to like give me like a real insight into what's going on with me. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=857.44s)]
*  So a lot of times real nice to go to those meetings and just listen, you know, and just hear. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=867.44s)]
*  And it's funny because sometimes people will put into words what I could. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=873.44s)]
*  I can never. It's like I'll have little pieces of of what I'm trying to feel, but I can't get the mosaic right. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=876.44s)]
*  You know, I can't get the I can't get it to really Jenga and then somebody else will they'll say it and they'll have just I mean they put all my pieces together. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=885.44s)]
*  It's like, oh man, thank you so much. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=896.44s)]
*  I've just had these pieces, you know. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=899.44s)]
*  So that's one thing that I really love about the meetings. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=903.44s)]
*  What else I want you guys to hit the hotline of and just I want to know who's listening to this show. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=907.44s)]
*  Just tell me what you do. It doesn't have to be really long. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=913.44s)]
*  You know, this is Ricky and I work at a you know, I work at a build a bear. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=915.44s)]
*  You know, I'm a associate or, you know, I'm a fur handler or whatever it is. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=923.44s)]
*  Do it, you know, and just hit the hotline. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=929.44s)]
*  Leave that and we just I'd love to know who's who's listening. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=931.44s)]
*  I feel nervous. I haven't done this kind of like a solo episode in a while. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=937.44s)]
*  So I don't know why I feel nervous about it, but that's OK. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=943.44s)]
*  It also could be excitement. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=948.44s)]
*  Sometimes nerve excitement like hot like it's we think it's nerves, but it's just like it's just excitement. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=951.44s)]
*  You know, I think we get we immediately sometimes or I immediately sometimes will say I'm at it's anxiety. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=960.44s)]
*  But fuck, I might just be a little psyched up about it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=966.44s)]
*  You know, it's been a while. It's been a while since I've gotten to sit here and. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=970.44s)]
*  And be in this seat and and and be a part of this program, so I'm grateful for that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=975.44s)]
*  All right, let's get into a little bit of news here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=984.44s)]
*  We got some news that has come in. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=986.44s)]
*  I thought this was pretty fascinating. Florida governor defends migrant flights to Martha's Vineyard suggests more to come. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=991.44s)]
*  So here's what happened is the Santas. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=998.44s)]
*  Who is a governor in Florida? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1002.44s)]
*  And I always think it's interesting how, like, if somebody there's a problem somewhere, people don't know about it elsewhere, but they'll have an idea about it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1005.44s)]
*  They'll be like, oh, well, this is what they should do. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1015.44s)]
*  This is what they should do. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1017.44s)]
*  But you until it's right there with you, then then suddenly it's you get a real concept of what the issues are. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1018.44s)]
*  So that's why I think this is pretty fascinating. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1027.44s)]
*  I mean, it's definitely a little bit get a little bit gangster to be using humans and shifting them around. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1029.44s)]
*  But. It's interesting now that it's suddenly a Martha's Vineyard. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1036.44s)]
*  You just imagine just, you know, 50 low key just looked out fucking visitors just hanging out. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1042.44s)]
*  That's the part to me that see, because I love anything that bothers fucking rich people. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1051.44s)]
*  I love that shit. If you could bother the rich man, if you could fucking tickle the rich with dirty fingernails, bitch, I love that shit. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1056.44s)]
*  So I think anytime you can drop off a couple of essays up in Martha's Vineyard, baby, let's do it. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1064.44s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. You know, you got M.S. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1072.44s)]
*  13, suddenly you got M.V. 13, baby got Martha's Vineyard 13, baby. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1075.44s)]
*  You know, that's when shit's going to get weird. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1081.44s)]
*  So, yeah, I just because then people get to see what the what issues are like. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1083.44s)]
*  We had a border patrol agent on here at one point, I remember, and he was in charge of the Arizona border for a long time. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1089.44s)]
*  I can't remember how long, maybe 17 years. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1100.44s)]
*  And he was saying one of the biggest problems on the border was that people were coming over, good people and bad people were coming over. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1103.44s)]
*  We're coming over and they weren't prosecuted, like even if they arrested the people, like two weeks later, they were coming right back because there was no like legislation happening where they were actually like the executive branch wasn't prosecuting them. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1111.44s)]
*  And you don't until you talk to somebody who's from there, you don't really have a good idea of what's going on. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1125.44s)]
*  So that's why I like this. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1132.44s)]
*  I wish there was like buses of different problems from different areas that were just kind of cruising around the country and they dropped somebody else's problem off in your area for a while. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1134.44s)]
*  And then they take your problems and drop them off of an air. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1145.44s)]
*  Then they take, you know, like in Maine, maybe they got beached whales or something issue. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1148.44s)]
*  And then they drop them bitches off in Idaho. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1154.44s)]
*  They're like, damn, bro, you know. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1156.44s)]
*  And I just think it would be interesting if different buses were just this like, oh shit, here come this fucking trouble bus. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1159.44s)]
*  And you see whose problem it is today. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1166.44s)]
*  You know, like, damn, they got, you know, like women aren't shaving under their arms in Oregon or whatever or in like, you know, somewhere. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1169.44s)]
*  And then them bitches get out. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1181.44s)]
*  You're like, dang, bro. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1183.44s)]
*  I didn't know it was like that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1185.44s)]
*  So I think it would be interesting if there was a whole system of this going on. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1187.44s)]
*  So that's something that I think I would like to see in the future is just like a whole kind of different issues from different areas kind of cruising around. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1192.44s)]
*  That way everybody could get a little bit of a taste and see. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1200.44s)]
*  Because then when you vote on a national level and you have an idea of your whole country, you get like a real idea of what real of what people's issues are. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1204.44s)]
*  You know, for me, a lot of that stems people talk about racism all the time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1219.44s)]

*  Some women, they'll damn, you know, I'm saying they could really they really, you know, they got that that fricking. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1456.44s)]
*  They got that that cooter glee. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1467.44s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1469.44s)]
*  These women are squirters. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1471.44s)]
*  They call them gunners. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1472.44s)]
*  I don't like using that kind of language, but they're real gunners, baby. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1473.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1476.44s)]
*  They'll damn. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1477.44s)]

*  They just, you know, the damn they could wash off the back of a moth at probably fucking eight feet. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1485.44s)]
*  But the female emission at orgasm is confirmed in a new study that the fluid that is released is from the bladder. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1494.44s)]
*  There's long been a lot of chatter over the years that it was, you know, female, you know, they had like a special, you know, you know, semen pocket in them or something. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1505.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1516.44s)]
*  But or that it was tears like a lot of women, you know, have a lot of tears built up in them and they just gun out all these tears at you. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1517.44s)]
*  But a lot of us knew that it was urine. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1525.44s)]
*  I mean, it was urine. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1528.44s)]
*  And so there's a new study that was done. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1531.44s)]
*  If you haven't heard about this and this is the International Journal of Urology. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1534.44s)]
*  It says five women, two in their 30s, two in their 40s and one in their 50s. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1542.44s)]
*  Dang, baby. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1547.44s)]
*  Dang. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1550.44s)]
*  Grandma got that super soca. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1551.44s)]
*  They participated in this study. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1554.44s)]
*  All women were able to squirt. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1557.44s)]
*  They were these gunners and three of them gunned out with sexual stimulation and two of them with penetrative sexual stimulation. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1560.44s)]
*  So one of them was just kind of reading the Braille or two of them were just reading the Braille and the other one was and the other three were using the pencil. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1572.44s)]
*  And what they did was they injected the women with a blue dye into their bladders so they they could tell what what was what. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1582.44s)]
*  What are they drained them first, it says a catheter was inserted before sexual stimulation and the bladder was empty. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1589.44s)]
*  So they drain these babes and then a mixture of indigo and saline was injected into the bladder. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1597.44s)]
*  Sexual stimulation was provided and it was videotaped and verified some perv out there running this deal. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1609.44s)]
*  And the secretions were collected in sterile cups and it was found the main component of squirt fluid is urine urine. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1616.44s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1629.44s)]
*  We knew it was a piss. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1631.44s)]
*  I say piss or pee pee, but I say piss also mostly. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1632.44s)]
*  We knew it was piss and it is. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1638.44s)]
*  If you didn't think it was piss, I think you're a real crazy. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1640.44s)]
*  You knew it was piss. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1643.44s)]
*  It was pee. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1645.44s)]
*  So anyway, yeah, that's what women have been doing. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1646.44s)]
*  They've been pissing. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1651.44s)]
*  Secret. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1653.44s)]
*  That's really a secret. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1654.44s)]
*  It's a tops. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1655.44s)]

*  Damn, you got that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1660.44s)]
*  That thing really somebody can water a plant, you know, or just dampen a, you know, dampen a damn. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1662.44s)]
*  I knew this one gal, she could dampen probably an eighth of a loaf of pepper farm, but it's bitch really had that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1670.44s)]
*  She had that baby hose backed up in her. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1677.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1680.44s)]

*  A new story came out about the 25 most dangerous jobs based on data from the Bureau Bureau of Labor Statistics. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1737.44s)]
*  So I peeped these up and the number five one was garbage collectors. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1751.44s)]
*  You don't think about it as being that dangerous, but you know that truck likes to chomp that truck will eat anything. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1757.44s)]
*  I think we'd a damn baby stroller. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1764.44s)]
*  That bitch will eat an ex-wife if you, you know, if you, you know, did something wrong to her, you know. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1766.44s)]
*  So, you know, that thing doesn't really have much of a conscience on it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1773.44s)]
*  And it's also people throw a lot of, you know, semi bad food out in the garbage. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1778.44s)]
*  So I'm sure you cruise on the back of that thing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1783.44s)]
*  Somebody threw a batch of bad shrimp in there. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1785.44s)]
*  And at first, if you're like me, if you're in a car, you see some food or something like I'm not going to have any. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1788.44s)]
*  But for some reason, three minutes later, I'm eating. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1794.44s)]
*  Doesn't matter what it's like that guard that owes or whatever that shit. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1797.44s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1801.44s)]
*  You put a bag by me. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1802.44s)]
*  I look at it. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1803.44s)]
*  I say, I hate that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1804.44s)]
*  Three minutes later, I'm eating. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1805.44s)]
*  I'm eating these little midget toast made for damn elves or whatever. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1807.44s)]
*  I'm eating. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1811.44s)]
*  I'm making a little fucking sandwich and putting a little peanut between. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1812.44s)]
*  I'm eating it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1814.44s)]
*  So I can imagine it's the same thing when you're out back there. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1816.44s)]
*  You know, you're hiding on the back of that jeep truck. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1819.44s)]
*  They always got two frickin little recycle bunnies hanging off the back of that bitch. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1822.44s)]
*  And and you forget somebody, you know, you know, somebody threw in some bad shrimp. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1828.44s)]
*  You out there a mile later, you fucking have two of them next thing you know, you you six feet under the sea, baby. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1835.44s)]
*  That's it. Bad shrimp. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1843.44s)]
*  Take anybody out, a king or a pauper. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1844.44s)]
*  So I could really see how that is the number five job that is unhealthy for people. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1847.44s)]
*  The number four most toughest, most dangerous job, roofers, it says right here, roofers. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1854.44s)]
*  You know, them little lid monkeys, baby, if you that's if you want to put a top on something, they trying to they trying to shut everything down and close everything in. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1862.44s)]
*  If you're a roofer, I remember we used to invite this one kid over to play to play at the house and me and my buddy, we would call him and invite him. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1871.44s)]
*  We would call him and invite him. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1880.44s)]
*  He live across the street. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1881.44s)]
*  But then we'd get up on the roof with a couple pellet guns and just spice him up, spice his skin up when he walked over. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1882.44s)]
*  And he already had this little fella had some he wasn't little, but he was he had some bone density deal going on. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1890.44s)]
*  And so part of him was little and part of him was big. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1898.44s)]
*  You know, he was just kind of that little that little wobble rabbit, you know, that little shake it like a sausage. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1902.44s)]
*  Oh, you know, he just had that built into him. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1908.44s)]
*  And and we're still all friends and shit. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1910.44s)]
*  It was just childhood shit. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1913.44s)]
*  But if we didn't have a roof, that kind of shit don't happen. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1914.44s)]
*  So I'm not shocked that roofing gets real, real dangerous overall. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1918.44s)]
*  Number three, we have Derek operators in oil and gas mining. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1922.44s)]
*  And that doesn't surprise me. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1930.44s)]
*  That's dangerous because. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1931.44s)]
*  I mean, natural gas, that's basically. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1932.44s)]
*  Mother, that's mother nature has got a it's just a fart that's hiding inside of mother nature. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1937.44s)]
*  That's all it is, man. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1943.44s)]
*  Natural gas, all that is, man. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1945.44s)]
*  So you're telling me, say you're laying somewhere, right? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1947.44s)]
*  And some dude rolls up with a needle and sticks it in your body and tries to suck a damn butt puff right out of you, bro. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1950.44s)]
*  Dude, I beat the elbows off that dude. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1959.44s)]
*  He won't be able to hug anybody. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1962.44s)]
*  He won't be able to hug correctly for damn 18 months. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1963.44s)]
*  So that's all mother nature. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1968.44s)]
*  Look, that's danger. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1969.44s)]
*  If you're trying to just, you know, suck a big dirt puff right out of mother nature's abdomen, then you get you get side swiped by her or whatever. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1970.44s)]
*  I'm not surprised she's beating people's asses and really causing hell and causing fatal accidents as fatal accidents. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1980.44s)]
*  So that don't shock me, man. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1986.44s)]
*  Any creep trying to suck something out of mother nature's gut is a real freak. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1987.44s)]
*  I think they are real booty freak nature style. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1991.44s)]
*  This is I can't tell if it's getting born to me or not. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1995.44s)]
*  But number two, aircraft pilots and it says private helicopter and aircraft pilots. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=1998.44s)]
*  And I think the issue with them, why it could be dangerous, because there's not as much with commercial pilots. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2006.44s)]
*  There's more checks and balances. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2012.44s)]
*  There's other pilots that they are all going to the airport with. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2015.44s)]
*  And but private, you just call your guy. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2018.44s)]
*  Hey, I'm ready to go. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2021.44s)]
*  You know, we're leaving in eight hour, leaving in three hour leave, you know, and he could be doing anything. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2022.44s)]
*  He could be hopped up on a couple of blue shoes, half an eight ball, whatever. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2027.44s)]
*  So now next thing you know, he's up there. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2032.44s)]
*  He's navigating, you know, the rich. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2034.44s)]
*  Then that's the rich man. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2038.44s)]
*  If you get rich, it gets risky. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2039.44s)]
*  You know, there's a cost to beat a boss. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2041.44s)]
*  And so that's what I think they get. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2043.44s)]
*  They get these pilots that they're ready to go, but they could have been up to no good right before. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2046.44s)]
*  So you get some dude up there, he's still all geeked up on some of that fucking on some of that no good stuff. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2053.44s)]
*  Geeked up on some of that fucking on some of that nose broth, baby. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2063.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2069.44s)]
*  Liquid cocaine. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2070.44s)]
*  And he's he's on damn hinge up there. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2071.44s)]
*  He's swiping on matches. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2075.44s)]
*  And the next thing you know, he swipes your fucking Learjet in the side of a mountain. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2077.44s)]
*  So I think that that's the issue with that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2082.44s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2085.44s)]
*  And the last one here is logging workers. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2087.44s)]
*  Logging workers. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2091.44s)]
*  I mean, you just get a real a lot of a lot of people that are trying to stay off the grid. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2093.44s)]
*  A lot of people. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2098.44s)]
*  And it's not really the tree you got to worry about that much because the tree only has two moves. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2100.44s)]
*  It has it has the fall and then the real most dangerous move of a tree. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2106.44s)]
*  The role. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2112.44s)]
*  People don't think about that bitch. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2114.44s)]
*  People yell timber and it falls. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2116.44s)]
*  And it falls. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2118.44s)]
*  Then it fucking rolls over nine people because they don't have a nobody thought of another thing for after timber. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2119.44s)]
*  That's really just ignorance. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2124.44s)]
*  So you get that timber, but you don't get that double up on the roll. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2127.44s)]
*  People getting down rolled out, you know, all of a sudden, you know, fucking stepdance flat and y'all poor. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2131.44s)]
*  So it's just, you know, they don't have a good plan for that, I think, with logging. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2137.44s)]
*  And the secondary issue is this man, a lot of cre a lot of just crawdad humans out there. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2142.44s)]
*  I work with this dude, Ronnie, bro. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2148.44s)]
*  And they call him Big Hat Ronnie and he was a brother and he had mental retardation. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2152.44s)]
*  And me and him got hired and I was supposed to be the boss, but he didn't understand what that meant. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2157.44s)]
*  So. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2163.44s)]
*  You know, when he was bigger than me anyway, and so we were both fucked. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2166.44s)]
*  We're about, you know, we're out there doing work for my buddy Richard, who actually died. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2169.44s)]
*  But we're out there and he this dude, bro, once they lit that saw up, they gave him that bitch. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2174.44s)]
*  He fucking cut everything, bro. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2181.44s)]
*  This dude cut fucking bird feeders in half, cutting fucking fences open. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2183.44s)]
*  Didn't give a shit. He cut open a damn chain link fence, bro. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2188.44s)]
*  This dude, man, he probably hit four trees in about maybe half an afternoon. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2192.44s)]
*  This dude cut a new fucking bathroom into your fucking kitchen. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2198.44s)]
*  This dude didn't give a shit, bro. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2201.44s)]
*  So and he loved the Lakers. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2204.44s)]
*  He loved the Lakers. I remember that. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2207.44s)]
*  And I hope he's doing well, too. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2210.44s)]
*  And he'd walk to work that dude leave for work at four thirty and get to work at fucking seven, bro. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2212.44s)]
*  And do walk to work just greased out natural God's grease, baby sweat. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2218.44s)]
*  And he just liked once that fucking gas fumes hit him and that fucking little baby, that little just that spinning scissor sword, bro. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2224.44s)]
*  He fucking cut anything. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2233.44s)]
*  Fucking cut the damn earth open, dude. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2236.44s)]
*  He didn't give a shit, bro. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2238.44s)]
*  So I can see how logging is dangerous because the trees and then the people you're doing it with, they're fucked. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2241.44s)]
*  What else? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2248.44s)]
*  We got some great calls that came in and the hotline as always. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2249.44s)]
*  Nine eight five six six four nine five zero three. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2254.44s)]
*  We've got some good, good calls that came in. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2260.44s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2264.44s)]
*  Hey, Theo. So I've been thinking I've been single about nine months now. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2267.44s)]
*  My fiance cheated on me with a dude. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2275.44s)]
*  So I obviously broke that off. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2280.44s)]
*  Thought it was disgusted. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2284.44s)]
*  But so he the thing that gets me right, he says that it was only sexual and that since it wasn't emotional, it's not gay. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2286.44s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2299.44s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2301.44s)]
*  For me, I think it's fucking gay. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2302.44s)]
*  If he's a tranny, which I guess he said it was, and he has a penis, it's gay, right? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2304.44s)]
*  Definitely gay. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2311.44s)]
*  Maybe if they transitioned and have the vagina, but it's not. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2314.44s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2319.44s)]
*  Just a question that's kind of eating me up. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2320.44s)]
*  What? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2323.44s)]
*  Thank you for the call, first of all. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2324.44s)]
*  And I'm sorry that you're going through this and I appreciate you sharing it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2327.44s)]
*  I think this is a big topic in America right now and in the entire world. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2331.44s)]
*  I think what your boyfriend or your your male boyfriend or whatever, I think what he's doing is called considering gay or attempted gay. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2337.44s)]
*  Because it's not really I'm going to go and be gay and do gay. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2351.44s)]
*  It's more like I'm going to he's kind of just he's just wandering into the car wash a little, you know, he just kind of looking at the different sponges and seeing how, you know, different things soak and how the suds kind of roll off of different edges and things. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2357.44s)]
*  It seems like. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2373.44s)]
*  And so I don't know if that's gay, you know, because he might like some guys like that. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2377.44s)]
*  I hear a lot about it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2383.44s)]
*  You would be surprised. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2385.44s)]
*  I hear a lot about men. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2387.44s)]
*  They like the titties and they like to have that little wand kind of wandering around that little doorstop on it, you know, because a lot of trans penises aren't fully functional. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2388.44s)]
*  And you can correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2403.44s)]
*  Because I don't know anything. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2406.44s)]
*  A lot of trans people's penises, they're not fully functional penises. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2408.44s)]
*  They are kind of part time wieners or they are some of them are not functional. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2412.44s)]
*  It's just like mistletoe for the book, for that be whole baby for that but whole. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2419.44s)]
*  So it's just a little bait and then you, you know, you hit him with that be whole baby. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2424.44s)]
*  So maybe he could just be super curious. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2431.44s)]
*  You he may want you to do some new stuff. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2435.44s)]
*  He may want you to put on a fake wiener or fake dick and do something with him, you know, or hit him with some fake dicks or something while y'all are having sex. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2437.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2451.44s)]
*  I don't know what he might want. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2453.44s)]
*  You know, you could. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2457.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2459.44s)]
*  You could write dick on your arm and fucking hit him with it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2460.44s)]
*  I don't know what kind of stuff he's into. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2463.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2465.44s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like he's just trying to be gay. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2466.44s)]
*  It seems like he's just kind of just, you know, I'll say it like this. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2468.44s)]
*  When I was when I was young, they had everybody went to the water fountain. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2474.44s)]
*  But there were some guys that would go to the water fountain and they would put their mouth on the thing and they would just take it all. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2481.44s)]
*  They didn't want to miss nothing. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2492.44s)]
*  They didn't want to miss a damn drop. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2495.44s)]
*  They would suck it right out the fucking machine. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2496.44s)]
*  You could hear the machine squeal a little. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2499.44s)]
*  Sometimes a big guy got on. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2501.44s)]
*  So you might just have a and I don't know if those men grew up to be gay or if they just like to get all the they just like to get their water different. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2504.44s)]
*  So you might not have a gay man. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2516.44s)]
*  You just might have a man who likes to drink a little different than you. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2518.44s)]
*  So it might just be more conversation you need to have with this gentleman. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2525.44s)]
*  Because if anything, he's just sound like a real curious man. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2531.44s)]
*  But but I wish you the best of luck. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2536.44s)]
*  It's hard out there. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2538.44s)]
*  It's hard for everybody who's, you know, looking for love. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2540.44s)]
*  It's just a it's a real lost and found to especially as we get older. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=2543.44s)]

*  You've been hit by a train and it just doesn't happen to folks. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3329.44s)]
*  Can you take us through some of that? Yeah, no problem. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3334.44s)]
*  So when I was in it was in high school, I was in high school about 10 years ago. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3337.44s)]
*  And when I would walk to school, there was a set of train tracks that every kid would have to cross to get to school. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3344.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And in my them risk sticks, baby, that's what those are. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3353.44s)]
*  Gang, baby. Okay. Sorry for interrupting you go on as high school. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3357.44s)]
*  You're out there. You're walking to school. Yeah, no problem. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3362.44s)]
*  I'm from. Yeah. So in my mind, I've never seen a train go by on these train tracks. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3366.44s)]
*  Like very seldomly does a train go by on these train tracks. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3374.44s)]
*  And it was right after Christmas and I got a big set of headphones for Christmas. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3379.44s)]
*  Yeah. And I was walking to school and I would know when to look up. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3385.44s)]
*  Like it's like across the street. Look both ways. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3390.44s)]
*  But this set of trains, I'm not I'm saying, you know, it's mostly my fault that this happened. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3393.44s)]
*  I'm not blaming anybody for this, but I was looking down with headphones on and the train was going very slow. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3400.44s)]
*  And when I think about it, if there was a camera on the situation, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3410.44s)]
*  what had to have happened was the trains going like this and I'm walking like this in perfect timing. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3416.44s)]
*  I step on the track. Train runs over my foot, hits me in the head. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3425.44s)]
*  It was only two carts long, so it wasn't a long train. But really, I went underneath a little. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3431.44s)]
*  And then I got back out. Sorry, if you went right under it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3437.44s)]
*  Yeah. And then I popped back out and then I woke up. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3441.44s)]
*  And then somebody seen the whole situation, somebody had to flag the train down. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3447.44s)]
*  Wow. They didn't even stop. What was going on? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3453.44s)]
*  Now, were you what song were you listening to? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3456.44s)]
*  I was listening to Ozzy, Revelation Mother Earth. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3460.44s)]

*  Were you conscious after you come out the bottom of it? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3484.44s)]
*  I woke up after like just beside the tracks. I woke up. I spit up blood. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3488.44s)]
*  I lifted up my leg and my leg was like completely like just limp. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3495.44s)]
*  Like everything was shattered in there and it was just completely limp. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3499.44s)]

*  I remember whenever you called in, you said that you'd been hit by a train and some of the positive effects that had come out of that. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3534.44s)]
*  And that if you if you could do it again, that you would do it again, you'd run it back. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3542.44s)]
*  Absolutely. I honestly think that if somebody could go through a near death experience and survive, obviously, very healing process. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3548.44s)]
*  Like, it's almost like God, you know, sat me down and said, you got to take this more seriously, you know, like I, you know, try and live like, you know, I hope for tomorrow, but you never know. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3558.44s)]

*  Like, what adjusted, if anything did? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3588.44s)]
*  Well, I kind of felt like before that, like I was in high school and I was a kid before that. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3591.44s)]
*  I was kind of like on autopilot and, you know, I would just, you know, I didn't know who I was. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3599.44s)]
*  And I was just kind of on autopilot in life. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3605.44s)]
*  And after that experience, you know, it really showed me that, you know, I had to come into my own character and showed me that life is important. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3608.44s)]
*  You know, like made me it's a part of who I am. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3619.44s)]
*  And it made me who I am. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3624.44s)]
*  I wouldn't change it at all. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3625.44s)]
*  I don't know where I'd be if that wouldn't happen. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqIHAVRXrQ&t=3627.44s)]
