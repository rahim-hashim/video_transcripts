*  Yeah. Had you been there before? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, once, kind of exploring. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=101.52s)]
*  I was doing a movie called Bones and All, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  I was trying to do research. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=104.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, my producer's favorite. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=105.84s)]
*  No way. Yeah, haven't seen you yet. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=107.36s)]
*  Yep, that guy, Zach is his name. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  No way. And he loves it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=110.64s)]
*  Yeah, he really loves it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=111.48s)]
*  No way, so I had wandered there, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  and this time got a better sense of it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=115.48s)]
*  It's a great city, huh? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good place. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=118.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like a little city. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=119.48s)]
*  It's like a little city, kind of like a fancy little city. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  It's almost like the Jambonet of cities. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=126.04s)]
*  Of cities. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=127.84s)]
*  Look at this outfit, kind of, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=129.84s)]
*  but dangerous at the same, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=131.88s)]
*  but it has kind of like an element of mystery, kind of. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=132.96s)]
*  That's kind of a weird example. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=135.96s)]
*  Are you from there? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=137.88s)]
*  No, I'm from Louisiana, but Nashville, here's what it is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=138.88s)]
*  It's safe, it's nice, people are friendly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=141.68s)]
*  You can't cheat on your wife there, so it's not. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=145.4s)]
*  Because the city's too small? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=147.8s)]
*  Too small. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=148.72s)]
*  You couldn't take your wife or spouse [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=149.72s)]
*  or significant other, you couldn't even, yeah, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  and you couldn't take them to a dinner or something [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=155.52s)]
*  and not see somebody that would know one of you or them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=157.32s)]
*  So it's. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=160.52s)]
*  There's like 14 people? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=161.36s)]
*  Yeah, well there's just enough people, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=162.28s)]
*  but this house is a little gossipy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=163.96s)]
*  Uh-huh, okay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=166.36s)]
*  So there's a lot of like, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=168.04s)]
*  it's not really an adultery city, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=168.88s)]
*  it's not a city that's, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=169.72s)]
*  adultery's not like a trademark of the city, probably. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=171.16s)]
*  How's it different from New Orleans? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  New Orleans is a little bit more dangerous, I think, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=175.28s)]
*  you know, and probably better food, to be honest. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=178.64s)]
*  I think you have to have crime to have good food, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  that's kind of how I feel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=184.56s)]
*  I've never heard that MO. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=187.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=187.88s)]
*  You ever had that Yakum in New Orleans? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=188.72s)]
*  That Yakum? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=192.64s)]
*  Is it not a drug, is it? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=193.92s)]
*  Okay, because I've had that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  You've never had Yakum? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=197.64s)]
*  I haven't had the edible version, no. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=198.6s)]
*  Oh, this thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=202.64s)]
*  Oh, this Vietnamese food. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=204.28s)]
*  I don't think so, I was watching top five, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=205.84s)]
*  like top five New Orleans street foods. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=208.84s)]
*  Hey, Yakum, homie. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=213.64s)]
*  That's a deep cut right there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=214.56s)]
*  It is a very deep cut. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=215.6s)]
*  I thought it came in a small baggie. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't had this, bro, I have not had this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=218.92s)]
*  But you know, New Orleans has one of the largest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=221.92s)]
*  Vietnamese populations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=224.0s)]
*  Really, in the country, I did not know that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=225.28s)]
*  I've never been to NOAA. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  I think so, you haven't? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=227.56s)]
*  Never. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=228.44s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=229.28s)]
*  And a lot of stuff shoots there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=230.12s)]
*  For some reason, I just haven't been there before. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=230.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  It's mythical. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, Nashville reminded me of Austin a little bit. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, Sixth Street. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=237.72s)]
*  That promenade a little bit. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=238.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=239.4s)]
*  Sort of, yeah, but. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=240.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that Broadway, that area, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=241.08s)]
*  that area's really interesting down there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=241.96s)]
*  What else about Nashville that I really like? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=244.28s)]
*  You go to the soccer games ever, Nashville SC? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  I haven't been to that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=249.28s)]
*  I go to watch Lipscomb College, they play soccer there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=250.12s)]
*  What? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=252.36s)]
*  At Lipscomb College. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a college, and they have soccer, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=254.72s)]
*  and so I'll go watch some of their games. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=257.24s)]
*  What's their student body population? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=258.68s)]
*  It's a good question, pull it up, Lipscomb College. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=260.36s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  It's one of those colleges that right next to it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=263.76s)]
*  has the high school also, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=265.28s)]
*  and then the children's school or whatever. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=266.68s)]

*  I would say that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  So I would say it's probably pretty decent, you know? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=498.44s)]
*  Man, that's pretty crazy, huh? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  But it is a really cool, it's a cool program, man. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=503.08s)]
*  I feel like I could see three stadiums from my hotel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  I feel like I could see the Vanderbilt one, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=507.28s)]
*  the Tennessee Titans one, and Nissan Stadium. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=508.52s)]
*  Shout out Nissan. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=511.68s)]
*  Is Nissan a big Tennessee car manufacturer? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  That's a good question, I don't think so. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  It sounds Nissan. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=516.96s)]
*  It's Japan, Japanese. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=519.52s)]
*  It's Japanese, huh. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=520.8s)]
*  Dude, thanks for coming in, Timothy, I appreciate it, man. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=524.48s)]
*  Man, thank you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=526.52s)]
*  Not with the shameless plug, but I got this movie, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=530.64s)]
*  A Complete Unknown, coming out on Christmas Day. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=532.72s)]
*  Yeah, did you actually see it? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=534.52s)]
*  Fantastic, man, so I'm excited that we can actually [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=535.88s)]
*  talk about it, and I was very much in the time period [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=537.72s)]
*  of the movie the whole time, trying to stay [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=540.76s)]
*  without being a dick within the bounds of the character, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=543.0s)]
*  but somebody in the hair and makeup trailer [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day, they would play this podcast, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=546.96s)]
*  which is how I discovered it, and particularly the episodes [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  with the garbage man, and the real life episodes, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=552.12s)]
*  the lunch lady, the coroner. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=555.08s)]
*  Wayne, yeah, Wayne the garbage man, he's doing good. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=556.84s)]
*  Those were awesome episodes, you know? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=559.96s)]
*  And sort of like worldviews that I wouldn't get otherwise. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=563.08s)]
*  Yeah, and you're from New York, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=566.12s)]
*  I'm from New York, so garbage man, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=568.4s)]
*  he totally recontextualized that for me. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  Bro, he did a great job, because they used to have. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=571.64s)]
*  They used to hate them, you know? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=574.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=576.04s)]
*  Yeah, because you think they're taking their time. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=576.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  And I realized how tough that job is. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=580.68s)]
*  It's rough. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he was throwing dogs in the back of the, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=583.16s)]
*  I mean, that story is, do you remember that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=584.68s)]
*  There's a lot of, yeah, a lot of missing, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=586.64s)]
*  formerly living things started to disappear. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  In the back of the, whatever. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=594.04s)]
*  Well, they used to have incinerators in the buildings, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=595.9599999999999s)]
*  that's what was crazy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=598.24s)]
*  So that people would put their trash, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=599.44s)]
*  it would hit the incinerator, and then they would just have, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=601.48s)]
*  I mean, this is like six years, seven years ago, I think, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=604.0s)]
*  but they would just have soot in barrels, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=605.6s)]
*  or in cans on the side of the street, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=609.0s)]
*  and then they started getting bags. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=610.96s)]
*  But he said, yeah, there's been times [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=611.96s)]
*  where a lot of things have shown up. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=613.08s)]
*  But thank you, man, for checking it out. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=614.72s)]
*  Yeah, all right, man. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=616.2s)]
*  For just hearing it on accident. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=617.0400000000001s)]
*  No, hearing it on accident, loving it, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=617.88s)]
*  and I'm so happy you saw this movie, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  and this is like, I hope this isn't [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=620.84s)]
*  like a shameless self-plug, but. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=623.6400000000001s)]
*  No, it's not at all this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=624.76s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=625.6s)]
*  We're happy that you're hearing, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=626.44s)]
*  and it's interesting. All right, I appreciate it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate it, yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=628.56s)]
*  And you get to do a biopic, or biopic, how do I say it? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=629.4s)]
*  I still don't know, man. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=631.68s)]
*  Biopic sounds like a medical procedure. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=632.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=635.04s)]
*  You know, that sounds like someone [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=636.52s)]
*  is inspecting your lungs to see if you played [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=638.16s)]
*  the role the right way. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=640.4s)]
*  I like biopic. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=641.8s)]
*  Biopic sounds fancier. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=642.64s)]
*  Yeah, biopic does sound fancier, I think that too. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=643.64s)]
*  Yeah, biopic. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=645.52s)]
*  Was it like, so let me think about a question like that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  Just so people know, this is about a four or five year period [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=650.1999999999999s)]
*  in Bob Dylan's life. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a period, yeah, a four or five year period [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=654.52s)]
*  in the early Bob Dylan's life, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=656.16s)]
*  and I'm sure a lot of people listening to your program [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  are already fans of Bob Dylan's, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=660.12s)]
*  but I'm sure a lot aren't, because to my generation, you know. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=661.2s)]
*  Yeah, people, some people don't know. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=663.6s)]
*  So I don't know, and he's really one of the most fantastic [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=664.6s)]
*  American artists of all time, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=667.84s)]
*  and has influenced our culture in so many deep ways, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=669.36s)]
*  and it's just, you know, I grew up on Kit Kutty and hip hop, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=671.72s)]
*  and that was really my passion, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  and then somewhere in my 20s, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  because this movie I was working on, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=681.8000000000001s)]
*  I became obsessed with this man, Bob Dylan, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=683.2s)]
*  who's absolutely, I could just speak about him endlessly, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=685.76s)]
*  and you know, I would love if people saw this movie, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  and even if they got a passing interest, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=692.64s)]
*  discover the world of Bob Dylan, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=694.76s)]
*  I feel like we get to be a bridge, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=695.96s)]
*  or a gateway to this guy, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=697.32s)]
*  and I hope this isn't one of your episodes [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=699.64s)]
*  where you got someone, you know, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=701.36s)]
*  like one of the ones people skip, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=704.0400000000001s)]
*  because it's like a person plugging, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  so you know what I'm saying, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=707.12s)]
*  I don't want to use that word, celebrity, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=708.96s)]
*  but like, you know, because my favorite episode's yours. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=709.88s)]
*  Oh, like a fancier person, hypothetically fancier. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=712.84s)]
*  No, I don't mean it like that, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=716.64s)]
*  but just like, like I said, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=717.4799999999999s)]
*  I like the ones that are off the cuff. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have like a lot of celebrities on, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=719.16s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I never really use that word, but. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=721.8s)]
*  No, that's okay. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=723.04s)]
*  No, no, I don't think so, look man, I think. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=724.16s)]
*  I feel like this part of the job is that though, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=726.8s)]
*  because when I'm working, I'm really very much in it, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  you know what I mean, and then here, anyway. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=730.64s)]
*  Yeah, actors get kind of a weird rap though, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=733.16s)]
*  because then they also have to be celebrities. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=734.76s)]
*  In some way, yeah, in some way, and. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=737.0s)]
*  So that's it, I'm talking about that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=739.3599999999999s)]
*  If you want to get your movie out, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  there's only a limit of how pretentious, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=744.12s)]
*  in some way, whatever, you know, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=747.52s)]
*  I want this, especially this movie, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=749.64s)]
*  I believe in this movie, and I believe in this man. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  He's a tremendous artist, so I want to get it out there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=753.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't think that's, man, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  I think that like you did the movie with the young man [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=761.0s)]
*  with drug addiction with Steve Carell's son. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, Beautiful Boy, yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=766.4s)]
*  Which was awesome, man. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=767.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know you struggle. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=768.16s)]
*  I've known you for that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=769.0s)]

*  that they can relate to or hear about it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=827.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=828.9599999999999s)]
*  So about the character, like, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=830.8s)]
*  so Bob Dylan has like such a famous, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  because yeah, a lot of younger generation [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=834.24s)]
*  might not know about him, you know? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=835.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=836.88s)]

*  That's a good Bob Dylan, man. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=843.4s)]
*  Was it? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=844.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was good. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=845.24s)]
*  How did you do, when you first decided, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  because I'm sure you had to practice it in your room [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=847.36s)]
*  or something like, tell me about the first time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=848.8s)]
*  That was super gradual. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  Can't do it with people that are fans, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=851.68s)]
*  because people that are fans of Bob Dylan will go, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=852.8s)]
*  they'll all tell you you got it wrong. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=854.8399999999999s)]
*  That's the trouble with playing someone so famous [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=856.36s)]
*  and beloved, everyone's got an opinion about him. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=857.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=859.8000000000001s)]
*  So you gotta put the blinders on [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=860.64s)]
*  and just kind of do it around people that, you know. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=861.76s)]
*  Look man, I'm usually not that prick actor [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=865.4s)]
*  who's like obliging his friends or whatever [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  to listen to the character he's working on, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=868.84s)]
*  but this is the one time I did that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=871.52s)]
*  Oh, I think you have to do that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=873.76s)]
*  Yeah, I have to do that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=874.88s)]
*  Because yeah, you don't want to get out there [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=875.72s)]
*  and do a bad job of it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=876.72s)]
*  Exactly, man. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=877.8000000000001s)]
*  This would have been blasphemous. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=878.72s)]
*  I would have gotten killed. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=880.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  I could still get killed. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=883.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=883.84s)]
*  But now it seems like, you know, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  getting a little bit of love, you know what I'm saying? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=885.52s)]
*  What would have happened? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=888.8s)]
*  Hey, sniper's down, lay down, sniper's down. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=889.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=891.7199999999999s)]
*  But was there a moment where you tried that? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=893.12s)]
*  Where you actually tried it? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=894.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes, very gradually. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=895.8s)]

*  Like the way Bob Dylan, when he came up, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=971.12s)]
*  there was like all these cafes in downtown New York [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=972.36s)]
*  and the music and now I went, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=974.48s)]

*  It was brutal. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=977.56s)]
*  Oh, I think in Manhattan probably, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=978.4s)]
*  maybe like somewhere in the village probably, right? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=979.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it was brutal. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=981.88s)]
*  I mean, I went to Cafe Wau where Bob Dylan came up [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  and it's just like Aerosmith covers now. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=985.16s)]
*  So some guy goes, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=988.9599999999999s)]

*  I grew up in Louisiana. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1224.1000000000001s)]
*  We had some theater, we just did like. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1225.5s)]
*  Did you ever do theater growing up? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1227.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I did, I did. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1227.98s)]
*  Well, it was just called Drama Club or whatever, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1228.94s)]
*  and it was a lot of people who was, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1230.8600000000001s)]
*  it was a lot of people, I think, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1232.3000000000002s)]
*  that were, wanted to be actors, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1233.3s)]
*  and then a lot of people that just were kind of like. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1234.7s)]
*  The outsiders. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1236.78s)]
*  The outsiders. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1237.62s)]
*  I went to the high school, it was the opposite. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1238.46s)]
*  The drama kids were the. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1239.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, the cool kids. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1240.54s)]
*  Yeah, and the basketball kids were like. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1241.3799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1243.46s)]
*  There was like four of them. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1244.3s)]
*  Bro, that's gotta be interesting, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1245.14s)]
*  because a lot of people don't get that opportunity. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1246.66s)]
*  No, it skewed my perception of the real world, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1248.3799999999999s)]
*  because then I got to Columbia, and I was like, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1249.98s)]
*  oh, shit, the value system is totally different. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1251.3s)]
*  But actually, in a serious way, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1253.62s)]
*  it kind of motivated me to go pursue my acting even harder. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1254.86s)]
*  But did you ever think about acting? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1257.78s)]
*  You're like, what's the exchange rate [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1259.18s)]
*  on this Hamlet scene I have? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1260.22s)]
*  No, exactly, exactly, exactly. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1261.74s)]
*  Yeah, I did just some stuff at school, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1264.78s)]
*  but I would always mess it up. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  We did like Sherlock Holmes or something, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1267.74s)]
*  and I was like Watson or whatever, his buddy or whatever. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1270.1s)]
*  It's like his. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1272.6999999999998s)]
*  Who was Sherlock? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1273.54s)]
*  His man crush, whatever. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1274.3799999999999s)]
*  And our guy was very progressive, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1275.22s)]
*  so we tried to make it, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1277.22s)]
*  there'd be like this small lover scene, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1278.06s)]
*  or just some ambiance between Sherlock and Watson. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1280.34s)]
*  You didn't go for it? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1284.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if I went for it or not. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  You gotta be bold, dude. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1286.54s)]
*  I was like 13. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1287.3799999999999s)]
*  You gotta go out there, man. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1288.22s)]
*  You gotta be bold. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1289.06s)]
*  You would've earned the respect of all your classmates, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1289.8999999999999s)]
*  or actually I don't know where you're from. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1291.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna go either way. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1292.6200000000001s)]
*  But yeah, there was this definitely kind of romantic [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1295.02s)]
*  where they're looking for the clues [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1298.14s)]
*  and they end up kind of finding each other. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1299.7s)]
*  That's what the guy said. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1301.22s)]
*  And I was like, this seems like insane. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1302.06s)]
*  But you didn't do it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1303.98s)]
*  I tried my best. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1305.3400000000001s)]
*  But then I remember the first time I got out there on stage, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1306.38s)]
*  I took on this Latino accent for some reason. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1308.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a strong choice, man. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1311.1000000000001s)]
*  It's all about strong choices. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1312.06s)]
*  And nobody knew it was coming. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1312.9s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1313.78s)]
*  And I was like, what's up, Holmes? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1315.46s)]
*  And then, so yeah, that was just, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1316.3s)]
*  and that's when I realized it was tough for me [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1318.58s)]
*  to be in some ensemble things. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to be by myself, you know? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1321.74s)]
*  Like that kind of thing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1324.06s)]
*  You found this, I mean, this was a format, right? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1324.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes, where stand-up came. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1327.02s)]
*  Would you do a movie if it came your way? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1327.86s)]
*  If I've got to make it myself, I could. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1331.3s)]
*  Okay, all right, you don't wanna be slotted into something. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1333.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1335.5s)]
*  I just am super protective about myself for some reason, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1336.4199999999998s)]
*  which may seem kind of weird. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1339.1s)]
*  For some reason, you had me on. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1340.1399999999999s)]
*  That was a bad choice. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1341.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1343.58s)]

*  you almost take a piece of the person's existence [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1794.52s)]
*  in a strange way, does that make any sense to you? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1798.04s)]
*  Yeah man, yes and no, you know, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1799.3999999999999s)]
*  because I've become such a fan of his [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1800.9599999999998s)]
*  that it's not like I feel like I'm a blemish on the legacy. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1802.72s)]
*  No, not at all, that's not what I mean. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1807.0800000000002s)]
*  Some people are gonna think you are, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1808.28s)]
*  they're gonna think that when they think of him [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1811.8400000000001s)]
*  in the future, your face will come into that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1813.72s)]
*  I'm just saying that even if I have like, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  a healthy amount of self-respect, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1817.96s)]
*  it's never gonna come close to who he is. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1819.3200000000002s)]
*  So I like the idea that I could be a bridge, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1821.44s)]
*  but like I had a buddy that said, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1823.6000000000001s)]
*  the Johnny Cash movie, Joaquin Phoenix, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1825.68s)]
*  who is the same director of Walk the Line, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1827.48s)]
*  he said, you know, I actually like Joaquin's versions [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1829.16s)]
*  of Johnny Cash's songs better than Johnny Cash's songs, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1831.76s)]
*  but I never wanted that, sincerely, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1834.0s)]
*  I don't want that to happen here, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1835.28s)]
*  and I wanted to protect against it [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1836.64s)]
*  because Bob's got this raw voice, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1837.72s)]
*  he's got this like iron voice, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1839.48s)]
*  and I never wanted these songs to be sort of like, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1841.28s)]
*  more gentle than his songs, you know, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1845.28s)]
*  and had to fight against that [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1847.28s)]
*  because the recordings we made, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1848.24s)]
*  a lot of them were super, it's hard man, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1849.6s)]
*  he was playing on a beat up guitar with shitty recorders, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1852.48s)]
*  he had a bronchitis in his early 20s, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1855.0s)]
*  his voice was all fucked up, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1857.0s)]
*  and I didn't want it to be like watered down, you know, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1858.56s)]
*  because he very purposefully was, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1862.1599999999999s)]
*  he liked Jack Kerouac and Moriarty, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1863.8799999999999s)]
*  he, you know, a lot of the books I read, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1865.96s)]
*  he didn't have great hygiene, you know, stuff like that, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1868.2s)]
*  so I didn't want the movie to be watered down all of a sudden. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1869.6799999999998s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1872.2s)]
*  Like you wanted to honor him as much as you could. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1873.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1873.8799999999999s)]
*  But also without being him as much, like you, like. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1874.72s)]
*  Yeah, not do this Hollywood version, basically. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1876.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  Because his biopic's a fine line, man, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1879.72s)]
*  and I've never done anything like this, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1882.04s)]
*  I usually play a role, actually, sort of. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Wonka you did, kind of. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1884.32s)]
*  Yeah, Wonka, I did, yeah, and. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1885.1599999999999s)]
*  But that's maybe not real. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1886.72s)]
*  No, but it's, yeah, thank God. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1887.8s)]
*  Well, don't tell the children. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1889.56s)]
*  God, thank God. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1890.4s)]
*  No, but also, you know, probably have to get psychiatric help. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1891.44s)]
*  But, no, and there's a certain pressure with that, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1894.2s)]
*  Wonka too, people are like very protective [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1897.52s)]
*  of characters they love, you know, they don't want, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1899.04s)]
*  and there's sort of like a cynicism about Hollywood, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1900.64s)]
*  you know, about like why do they keep revisiting. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1902.36s)]
*  The Wonka thing I felt was justified, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1905.2s)]
*  because it's a new story, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1906.8s)]
*  we weren't doing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1907.96s)]
*  we were doing sort of an origin, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1909.52s)]
*  and by the way, I don't know if you've seen Wonka, have you? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1911.2s)]
*  Yeah, which one have I seen? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1914.6s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen all of them. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1916.2s)]
*  You watched it while you were in the car [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1917.08s)]
*  spying on the Lyft's car in college. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1918.32s)]
*  I, I. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1921.3999999999999s)]
*  You had it playing on the audio, but. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1923.08s)]
*  First of all, if you've never seen the Wonka movie, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1926.36s)]
*  you just listen to the audio, that's a little bit. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1927.96s)]
*  That's already weird too. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1929.76s)]
*  That's kind of, yeah, it's interesting. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1930.6s)]
*  They hit Stevie Wonder at the movie last night. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1932.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh really, interesting bridge right there. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1933.8s)]
*  No, but I was saying the same thing, man. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1936.48s)]
*  I was like. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1937.56s)]
*  That is right, yeah, like just, yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1938.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no disrespect, but I was just saying. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1939.3999999999999s)]
*  No, the Godfather of surround sound, basically, yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1941.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1943.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I heard, the premiere was pretty interesting. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1945.32s)]
*  So last night was your premiere. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1948.12s)]

*  Oh, dude, thanks for coming the day after your premiere. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1951.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I was a little late. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1953.96s)]
*  I apologize, man. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1954.8s)]
*  Were you guys up late? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1955.84s)]
*  We were up late and I basically, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1957.0s)]
*  I shot this movie, Marty Supreme, All the Fall. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  These crazy directors, or crazy director, Josh Saf. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1961.04s)]
*  Do you ever see Uncut Gems? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1963.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, so good. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1965.0s)]
*  That director, so it's kind of that energy, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1965.84s)]
*  that chaotic thing. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1967.12s)]
*  So it wasn't like a low energy shoot. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1968.04s)]
*  This was like 16 hour days for three months, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1970.52s)]
*  then it went right into this. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1972.4399999999998s)]
*  So I haven't been drinking at all, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1973.72s)]
*  not that I ever really had a problem with it, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1976.08s)]
*  but just, you know, because he's dead. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1977.32s)]
*  And I actually find my mind is so much sharper. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1978.96s)]
*  I'm amazed I haven't gotten sick through this whole [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1980.68s)]
*  last couple months, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1983.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1986.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, my voice is a little scraggly. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1987.72s)]
*  No, you gotta celebrate. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1988.6000000000001s)]
*  Did you have to get up and make a speech? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1989.44s)]
*  What's it like at something like that? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=1990.84s)]

*  Yeah, look at Boyd Holbrook, man, with the blue suit on. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2042.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. That's a handsome man. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2045.72s)]
*  Is he real handsome? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2046.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's a stud. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2048.4s)]
*  Well dude, you're kind of a handsome dude, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2049.88s)]
*  like a lot of dudes. You are, man. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2051.6s)]
*  Look at the, people, I've seen so many people. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2052.7200000000003s)]
*  Calm down, brother. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2053.92s)]
*  I've seen so many people ape your haircut. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2055.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2056.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of freaking thieves out there. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  How long have you had it? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2059.8s)]
*  This haircut I've had for probably, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2060.84s)]
*  it's a little dicey today. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2063.8s)]
*  I've had it for probably, well I had it as a child. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2064.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh no way, so this goes back. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2067.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, and then I tried to blend in [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2068.6400000000003s)]
*  whenever I moved to Hollywood and stuff [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2071.1600000000003s)]
*  and it didn't work for me, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2073.08s)]
*  and so then I tried to blend out. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2074.08s)]
*  Oh, so you started in LA before Nashville. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2075.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2076.52s)]
*  Yeah, I lived out here for 12 years. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2077.36s)]
*  I was doing stand-up comedy here. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2078.48s)]
*  This is where I started doing stand-up comedy. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2079.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, where, at the comedy store and stuff like that? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2080.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2082.36s)]
*  Comedy store. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2083.2000000000003s)]
*  It was awesome, man. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2084.04s)]
*  I really enjoyed it over there. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2084.88s)]
*  And a whole generation of comedians [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2085.7200000000003s)]
*  came out of there then, huh? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2087.12s)]
*  Yeah, and that was like, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2088.52s)]
*  yeah, all types. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2090.56s)]
*  They had like Chris D'Elia, Tom Segura. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2091.4s)]
*  Is that a bigger comedy base here than New York, you think? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2094.2s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2098.16s)]
*  You know what's so funny? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2099.0s)]
*  They're totally different from each other, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2099.84s)]
*  and some people in one don't even know [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2101.68s)]
*  the people in the other. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2103.44s)]
*  Because the audience is different, you think? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2104.56s)]
*  Just, it's just a total different group of people. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2106.24s)]
*  Like you go there and it's almost like [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2108.52s)]
*  it feels like you have to start all over. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2109.64s)]
*  It's just a total different. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2110.84s)]
*  Like I'll go into a club there and it feels like [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2112.72s)]
*  A whole different thing. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2115.6s)]
*  I'm walking into a club for the first time. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2116.44s)]
*  In New York, you don't think you get the love [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2118.0s)]
*  you get out here? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2119.12s)]
*  You'll get a lot of respect, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2120.92s)]
*  but you just feel that way. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2121.76s)]
*  It's not your territory, you know? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2122.6s)]
*  Right, right, right, right, right. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2123.92s)]
*  And you wanna give respect to the guys [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2125.08s)]
*  that that's their grounds that they walk on every day. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2126.88s)]
*  Interesting, interesting, interesting. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2129.12s)]
*  Because that's where they live. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2130.12s)]
*  Like if somebody came out and was like [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2130.96s)]
*  being real flashy, but they're not in your, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2132.52s)]
*  in your kind of club here, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2135.96s)]
*  it would be the same way, I think. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2137.48s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2138.68s)]
*  So there's a lot of code of conduct like that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2139.52s)]
*  Would you ever do Saturday Night Live? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2140.36s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2143.0s)]
*  You know, it's so funny, I went and saw it recently. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2144.6s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2146.76s)]
*  It's a crazy setup. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2147.6s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2148.44s)]
*  Yeah, I've done it twice. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2149.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2150.1400000000003s)]
*  It's super dialed in, right? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2150.98s)]
*  I shoulda known that. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2151.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2152.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2153.5s)]
*  I went with Chris Farley's brother. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2154.34s)]
*  It was the first time that he'd been back [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2155.1800000000003s)]
*  to go to SNL since his brother was on there, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2156.98s)]
*  since he'd went with him. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2160.2200000000003s)]
*  So it was pretty neat. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2161.5s)]
*  What was that like for him? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2162.34s)]
*  He was, dude, he told so many great stories. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2163.5400000000004s)]
*  I wish they'd have put him out on stage. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2166.1400000000003s)]
*  I was like, have him go out there, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2167.78s)]
*  tell his stories. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2169.7000000000003s)]
*  It was just classic, man. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2170.94s)]
*  But I went to watch Bill Burr. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2172.26s)]
*  I'm a big Bill Burr fan, so I went to watch him. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2173.26s)]
*  Did you see the last Sandler special on Netflix? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2175.1000000000004s)]
*  McGee performed that night, too. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2176.9s)]
*  Oh, sick. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2178.02s)]
*  That was dope. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2178.86s)]
*  Wow, yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2179.7s)]
*  And then, there we are right there [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2180.54s)]
*  with Chris Farley's brother right there. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2182.5s)]
*  I thought that was McGee. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2183.58s)]
*  Dude, you look like you're 23, man. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2186.46s)]
*  I know, dude. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2188.34s)]
*  It's true. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2189.18s)]
*  Did he say, did you take your haircut or no? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2190.02s)]
*  I look like I'm on HGH, dude. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2190.86s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2192.54s)]
*  I gotta get some HGH. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2193.38s)]
*  Do you work out? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2195.14s)]
*  Yeah, I do work out, dude. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2196.06s)]
*  Yeah, I do, God. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2197.5s)]
*  Yeah, I went today, I mean, that's what I mean. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2199.26s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2202.54s)]
*  We once, works out once. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2203.38s)]
*  What else do I wanna know about this film? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2208.94s)]
*  So you didn't hear anything from Bob. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2210.94s)]
*  What about his wife or his kid or something? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2212.62s)]
*  No, his kids, almost towards the start, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2214.82s)]
*  Monica who plays Joan Baez in the movie, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2218.38s)]
*  she was in touch with Joan the whole time. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2220.86s)]
*  And I thought about reaching out to his kids, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2222.7400000000002s)]
*  but the thing is, when somebody gets revered like Bob [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2224.02s)]
*  at some point, he becomes this legend. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2226.54s)]
*  People can sanitize the past. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2230.5s)]
*  What do you mean by that when you say that, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2233.26s)]
*  just so we know? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2234.1s)]
*  They could present the best version of someone [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2234.94s)]
*  and not present their flaws. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2237.46s)]
*  Even a lot of the documentaries about Bob, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2239.2599999999998s)]
*  they just paint him as a genius. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2240.66s)]
*  There's one documentary called Don't Look Back, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2241.8599999999997s)]
*  this T.A. Pennebaker one, where you actually see him raw. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2243.5s)]
*  It just captures his behavior. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2246.8599999999997s)]
*  And it was sort of right before he got too famous [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2248.3399999999997s)]
*  where he turned his back on letting himself be filmed. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2249.9399999999996s)]
*  And so that was the biggest help for me. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2252.8199999999997s)]
*  And I thought about talking to his kids or his grandkids, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2254.18s)]
*  but actually I was at the University of Minnesota, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2256.2999999999997s)]
*  like three days ago, we're doing a screening [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2258.9399999999996s)]
*  for the students there. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2261.16s)]
*  And then someone said, this is Milo Dillon, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2262.62s)]
*  this is his grand nephew. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2264.14s)]
*  And he kind of looked like Bob, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2266.7799999999997s)]

*  Oh yeah, he's been on that. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2322.18s)]
*  He's a great, he is so creative. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2323.86s)]
*  He has one of the most creative minds I've been around. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2325.1s)]
*  Just like to, he has his own pentameter [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2327.46s)]
*  of making jokes and stuff. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2329.1s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2330.04s)]
*  Is he stand up? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2330.88s)]
*  Nope, he's not a stand up. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2331.72s)]
*  I think there's this new thing that goes on now [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2332.7s)]
*  where if somebody's, it's interesting, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2334.66s)]
*  what's gonna happen with stand up? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2337.32s)]
*  Because stand up has been this thing [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2338.42s)]
*  that people always go practice and then they go do. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2339.66s)]
*  But now a lot of people build so much traction [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2341.78s)]
*  from social media. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2343.78s)]
*  Yeah, then they pop off like that. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2345.02s)]
*  Right, so then how do you, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2346.32s)]
*  but then how do you take that and perform it? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2347.18s)]
*  Is there a performance element? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2349.38s)]
*  It's a whole different thing. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2350.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2351.78s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what podcasts are. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2353.18s)]
*  Grand and the stand up is different, right? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2354.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's different. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2354.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you feel like stand up's in a golden era? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2355.7s)]
*  I feel like it's like boxing. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2357.1s)]
*  I feel like now, I feel like Netflix kinda made it [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2357.94s)]
*  sexy again in some way. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2362.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think, well the news got very all the same, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2363.7799999999997s)]
*  I feel like. Right. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2368.1s)]
*  And it got very, a lot of people believe maybe [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2368.94s)]
*  commandeered by advertising in a way. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2372.74s)]
*  Right, right, right, right, right. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2375.22s)]
*  Some of that happens, it's capitalism. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2376.06s)]
*  So I think podcasting was just this like. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2378.0s)]
*  Became this open format. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2381.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2382.8199999999997s)]
*  Where it was like, okay. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2383.66s)]
*  Also you know that you're really resonating in some way. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2384.48s)]
*  Yeah. Right, cause it's not dollars that, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2385.7799999999997s)]
*  or it's not like. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2387.8599999999997s)]
*  Well especially in the beginning, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2388.7s)]
*  for the first like four or five years, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2389.54s)]
*  you're not really making any money. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2390.74s)]
*  So it's like, you're just doing your best, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2391.74s)]
*  you're just keeping it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2394.2599999999998s)]
*  And then at a certain point, like people will say, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2395.1s)]
*  well if you're not gonna let me say what I want, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2398.2599999999998s)]
*  then get your advertising off of my network. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2399.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's a risk man. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2402.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2404.54s)]
*  I mean it's a risk dollars wise, right? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2405.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, it's a risk dollars wise, yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2406.22s)]
*  I mean Dana White was on here one time, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2407.22s)]
*  and one of our episodes got pulled down [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2408.74s)]
*  because of, we had Bobby Kennedy on this, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2410.58s)]
*  a political friend, a buddy of mine, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2414.74s)]
*  but who also ended up going into politics. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2417.2599999999998s)]
*  But they didn't want to be associated with it or whatever. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2419.24s)]
*  And anyway, Dana was on and he said, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2421.54s)]
*  what, who called and said they, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2423.2599999999998s)]

*  Kellogg's. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2427.94s)]
*  It was a biking company or something. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2428.7799999999997s)]
*  No, it was like a Proton or whatever it's called. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2429.7799999999997s)]
*  Peloton. Peloton. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2431.94s)]
*  Peloton, interesting. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  And dude, next thing you know, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2433.62s)]
*  people all across the country were throwing pelotons [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2434.54s)]
*  into the Boston River. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2437.06s)]
*  Well they give you heart attacks too. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2438.46s)]
*  Well that's not gonna help them. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2440.2599999999998s)]
*  No, based on that Sex and the City, Mr. Biggs. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2441.66s)]
*  That's how he died. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2445.42s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2446.2599999999998s)]
*  You didn't see that he died on the Peloton in the episode. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2447.1s)]
*  He dies in the episode, and then their stock crashed [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2448.94s)]
*  because people thought it was killing. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2451.9s)]
*  And they obviously had to sign off on that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2453.1s)]
*  I guess, that wouldn't be a good idea. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2455.06s)]
*  That's a real thing, right, Mr. Biggs, I think. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2456.34s)]
*  Can we see that? Yeah, we're pulling it up. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2458.5s)]

*  And he put me on the couch. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2622.52s)]
*  Then he assumed the character we all know [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=2623.9199999999996s)]

*  It's a great movie. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3270.56s)]

*  Have you ever met him? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3272.22s)]
*  No, man, but Matchstick Men's [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3273.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3275.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, Nicolas Cage, man. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3277.12s)]
*  What a life. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3279.92s)]
*  But yeah, I'd like to get a wife, maybe. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3280.7599999999998s)]
*  What about, there's kind of a love triangle in the movie. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3281.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3284.56s)]
*  So the women's Joan Baez. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3286.0s)]
*  Joan Baez and Sylvie Russo. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  Is Sylvie Russo, was she an artist? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3289.72s)]
*  I couldn't tell. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3291.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, she's, her real name, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3292.12s)]
*  Sue's Ritolo in real life, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3293.52s)]
*  but the real Bob Dylan was still very protective over her. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3294.56s)]
*  She was never really famous. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3297.42s)]
*  So that was one of his big script notes. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3298.8199999999997s)]
*  He said, change that name. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3300.24s)]
*  And you know, just, I think he felt protective [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3301.56s)]
*  over her legacy in some way. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3305.24s)]
*  And so he had some notes about the script. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3307.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3309.0s)]
*  The love triangle is sort of one of the big, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3309.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, like we do these Q&A's for the movie now, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3314.3599999999997s)]
*  and people will say, was Bob, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3315.8799999999997s)]
*  was his behavior towards the people [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3318.4399999999996s)]
*  that he was in a relationship with in his life, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3321.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, it's definitely complicated. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3323.24s)]
*  But my answer is always, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3324.8799999999997s)]
*  he was focused on his art first and foremost. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3326.12s)]
*  Also, this movie's about people in their early 20s. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3327.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't really have life figured out, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3329.7599999999998s)]
*  especially in relationship then. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3330.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3332.16s)]
*  That stuff was a mess at that age. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3333.0s)]
*  So he was kind of between these two women in the movie, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3335.62s)]
*  and Joan Baez is a musician and artist, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3338.58s)]
*  ambitious the way Bob would have been, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3340.82s)]
*  and Sylvie's really the more grounded character. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3342.18s)]
*  I think what Elle Fanning does in the movie is incredible. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3344.62s)]
*  You kind of see the movie through her eyes, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3346.2200000000003s)]
*  because she's not one of these famous musicians. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3347.7400000000002s)]
*  She's really just a real person and is deeply affected. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3350.06s)]
*  Yes, she was very affected by Dylan and her character was. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3354.1s)]
*  That was interesting to see. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3357.38s)]
*  And the things that pulled. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3358.9s)]
*  She's the only person in the movie [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3360.42s)]
*  that doesn't have a transactional relationship with him. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3361.5s)]
*  Really loves him for who he is. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3363.38s)]
*  That was our theory. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3368.58s)]
*  I never talked about Dylan, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3369.42s)]
*  but I feel like that's why I think he's still fond [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3370.2400000000002s)]
*  of that relationship and private about it. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3372.06s)]
*  Because if maybe the rest of his life could be confusing, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3374.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to speak for him, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3377.5s)]
*  but confusing about who's being genuine with me [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3378.34s)]
*  and who's not. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3380.5s)]
*  She was always the clear day one. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3381.34s)]
*  Clear candidate. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3383.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3384.58s)]
*  Wow, that's interesting. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3385.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3386.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I found like when I was watching it, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3387.54s)]
*  yeah, you're kind of rooting. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3392.1s)]
*  It's weird because who you're rooting for changes [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3393.62s)]
*  almost from scene to scene in the movie. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3396.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3397.86s)]
*  You know? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3398.7s)]
*  Yeah, no one's like a great. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3399.54s)]
*  Besides Elf Fanny, everyone comes off a little. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3401.66s)]
*  Real. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3403.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, hopefully. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3404.58s)]
*  Like flawed, but like in a human way. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3405.42s)]
*  Flawed in a human way and a little, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3407.3399999999997s)]
*  especially in your early 20s, man, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3408.62s)]
*  you're trying to figure out your life. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3409.66s)]
*  Oh, dude, they don't even, yeah. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3410.86s)]
*  Were you a saint in your early 20s? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3413.2599999999998s)]
*  Dude, no, I was. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3414.7s)]
*  I mean, I was a saints fan. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3416.22s)]
*  I'm a New Orleans Saints fan, but I was not. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3417.66s)]
*  I was not. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3420.18s)]
*  You're at the game bucket. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3421.06s)]
*  I mean, I had on maybe a, you know, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3423.22s)]
*  I might've had on a Drew Brees jersey. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3424.9s)]
*  Drew Brees jersey on your 16th Miller Lite. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3427.14s)]
*  Dude, yeah, that's for sure. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3428.94s)]
*  That was. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3430.94s)]
*  But no, yeah, it's like, yeah, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3432.86s)]
*  how do you even start to get things figured out? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3435.18s)]
*  But that's one thing that I liked about it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3438.42s)]
*  I liked seeing the different, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3439.74s)]
*  and I liked that there was like, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3440.66s)]
*  okay, what's this relationship like over here gonna happen? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3441.7s)]
*  What's this relationship like over here gonna happen? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3444.3s)]
*  And then just seeing like, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3446.66s)]
*  I did get a better idea of like, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3448.18s)]
*  oh, okay, Bob Dylan was just kind of like a fact dude [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3449.7s)]
*  that he kind of was maybe better than he thought he was, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3453.4199999999996s)]
*  or he was actually so great, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3457.62s)]
*  and they tried to manipulate him. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3460.9399999999996s)]
*  It was just all so confusing, you know, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3462.8199999999997s)]
*  and I think it was confusing to him, and it was like. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3465.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3467.3399999999997s)]
*  It was just a lot going on, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3468.18s)]
*  and he seemed like a unique person, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3470.62s)]
*  and probably like a secretly sensitive guy, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3472.22s)]
*  and so for all those things to happen so quick to him, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3474.8599999999997s)]
*  and then for him to try to figure it out [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3478.46s)]
*  and navigate what was real, I don't know. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3480.02s)]
*  Man, exactly, and that's something I can relate to, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3482.46s)]
*  not in the relationships necessarily in my life, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3484.2200000000003s)]
*  but you know, you feel like your career gets going, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3485.58s)]
*  I don't know how you feel about that, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3487.78s)]
*  and you wanna protect your energy, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3488.7400000000002s)]
*  but you still wanna have close friendships [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3493.38s)]
*  and relationships, but at first, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3496.06s)]
*  it's a hard thing to navigate, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3497.7400000000002s)]
*  particularly if you wanna keep writing, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3499.9s)]
*  you keep wanting, like Bob Dylan, you know, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3501.02s)]
*  and like you said, he was genuinely great at it. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3502.54s)]
*  He had a gift from God at that point in his career. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3504.14s)]
*  He said it in an Ed Bradley interview in 2004. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3506.14s)]
*  He's like, I feel like God was writing through me, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3508.7799999999997s)]
*  and he says in the interview, I can't do it anymore. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3510.62s)]
*  He almost says it like, like, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3512.2599999999998s)]
*  Like he misses it? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3514.5s)]
*  Like he misses it, yeah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3515.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a beautiful moment in this Ed Bradley interview. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3516.18s)]
*  He just, he says, I can't do it anymore. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3517.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know how those words were coming to me, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3520.22s)]
*  and yeah, and I feel like musicians even more than actors. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3522.06s)]
*  I feel like an actor, like into your 30s and 40s and 50s, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3525.7s)]
*  as your face ages, you can keep doing great work, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3528.46s)]
*  and the gravitas of your life lives on your face. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3531.2999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3534.3399999999997s)]
*  Right, and so the more you learn in life, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3535.18s)]
*  the more abilities you're gonna have. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3536.9s)]
*  Yeah, and the more trauma you go through, whatever, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3538.7000000000003s)]
*  and I feel like as a musician, you can still do great shit, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3540.26s)]
*  but it's really like a young man's game, you know? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3542.98s)]
*  Yeah, because you have to do all that touring and stuff [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3545.5s)]
*  as well. Yeah, it beats you up. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3547.02s)]
*  For you, the movie kind of tours for you. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3547.94s)]
*  Exactly, you know, I love, you know, it's funny, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3550.3s)]
*  we do these Q and A's, so I get the backstage experience, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3552.58s)]
*  my holy shit, I'm coming out, man, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3554.9s)]
*  like fuck, they're gonna say my name out loud, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3556.34s)]
*  and I'm all excited, and I come out, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3557.6600000000003s)]
*  and then as opposed to a rock star, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3559.34s)]
*  I fucking sit in a chair. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3560.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. And I answer much questions. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3562.26s)]
*  Like watch this. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3563.54s)]
*  And then I sit down, and I try to give poised answers. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3564.42s)]
*  And just make sure your posture's okay the whole time. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3567.02s)]
*  Dude, it's humiliating. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3569.5s)]
*  Posture rocking in the house tonight, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3570.78s)]
*  that shit is so hard to deal with, dude. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3572.34s)]
*  Because I'll be backstage, and you hear the crowd, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3574.06s)]
*  like Timothy Shama, yeah, and then I fucking take my seat, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3575.9s)]
*  yeah, and then I'm poised. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3581.1s)]
*  Yeah, you're like, oh, let's go! [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3582.1800000000003s)]
*  And I sit down. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3583.6600000000003s)]
*  And I sit down, dude, it's humiliating. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3584.5s)]
*  It's like, it's very anti, I don't know what the word is, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3586.5s)]
*  but somebody else probably knows it, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3589.7000000000003s)]
*  but yeah, I don't know it, but, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3591.62s)]
*  yeah, dude, you know what though? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3593.94s)]
*  I think it was, I do think that it was interesting [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3595.58s)]
*  if you frame it up, like this is what it is. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3597.98s)]
*  It's a few years in a man's life [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3600.02s)]
*  that was a very interesting man [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3603.26s)]
*  who's probably written so many songs [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3604.86s)]
*  that some young people don't even know that he wrote. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3606.34s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3608.42s)]
*  I was listening, and I was like, no way he wrote that, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3609.26s)]
*  and like just some relationships that he had [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3611.34s)]
*  with other artists that you may not even know about. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3613.5s)]
*  And sort of the first guy for me in American pop culture [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3615.78s)]
*  that said, I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3618.14s)]
*  And that was like, yeah, and that was like sort of blasphemous. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3620.2200000000003s)]
*  Every artist through the last 30, 40, 50 years that, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3622.38s)]
*  a lot of whom you can't shout out [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3626.9s)]
*  because they've basically burned so many bridges, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3627.94s)]
*  but Bob Dylan was the first. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3630.7400000000002s)]
*  He just wouldn't take no for an answer. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3633.26s)]
*  He just was fired up about his art. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3634.7000000000003s)]
*  And his perception. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3636.9s)]
*  No, I don't think it sounds like anything. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3638.34s)]
*  Yeah, but it didn't sound corny [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3639.42s)]
*  because he really didn't give a fuck. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3640.3s)]
*  And that to me was really refreshing to work on. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3641.5s)]
*  Now we live in a time where it's not only is it hard [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3645.3s)]
*  to be rebellious about your art, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3647.82s)]
*  but it's as much about the Coliseum's reaction. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3649.02s)]
*  You think about a clip you like online [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3651.62s)]
*  or something you like or don't like, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3653.18s)]
*  the first thing you do is you go to the comments. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3655.06s)]
*  It's as much about how people are reacting, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3656.22s)]
*  as it is about the actual thing. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3658.74s)]
*  So in some ways it's harder now. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3662.02s)]
*  It's kind of harder now. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3663.42s)]
*  Because not only do you have to manage what you present, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3664.2999999999997s)]
*  but do you have to manage also how, I don't know. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3666.14s)]
*  No, no, but yeah, I was just trying to say. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3670.34s)]
*  And also to avoid that, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3671.8199999999997s)]
*  that's kind of what I'm doing these days, man. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3673.86s)]
*  You just gotta like, you have to bury your head so far. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3675.5s)]
*  Even like the pictures from the premiere, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3677.94s)]
*  I'm just like, I just try to put the shutters on. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3679.34s)]
*  Because it's not healthy, man. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3682.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, looking at all your stuff and looking at that? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3684.26s)]
*  Yeah, you know. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3685.6200000000003s)]
*  No, it's weird. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3686.46s)]
*  No, it's fucking weird. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3687.3s)]
*  And then, you know. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3688.1400000000003s)]
*  You're not supposed to do it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3688.96s)]
*  No, we're supposed to be gathering nuts and berries. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3689.8s)]
*  No, that's not like I'm fucking. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3692.86s)]
*  You'll know they had that first guy, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3694.26s)]
*  Narcissus or whatever, looked in the river and saw himself. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3695.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3697.94s)]
*  And then he's like, hey, where the ladies at or whatever. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3698.78s)]
*  And you're like, whoa, dude, what are you talking about? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3701.2200000000003s)]

*  You could do. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3778.02s)]
*  I don't know what I could do, maybe. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3780.54s)]
*  You could do a Brad Pitt biopic, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3782.34s)]
*  Put a little of that right there, come on, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3784.02s)]

*  Maybe if, like, maybe a Brad Pitt [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3787.78s)]
*  like was stranded somewhere, like, you know, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3790.06s)]

*  I don't fucking know if I like him. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3814.98s)]
*  He could be a dirt ball, but I like some of his energy, dude. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3816.14s)]
*  Some of his shit is pretty high. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3819.42s)]
*  It's very Bob Dylan, man, just be who you wanna be. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3820.26s)]

*  Oh, I feel like he's kind of unique. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3824.74s)]
*  He kind of reminds me of like an Eminem, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3827.18s)]
*  like when Eminem kind of like, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3828.4599999999996s)]
*  he reminds me of how Eminem was just unique [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3830.8599999999997s)]
*  in his time period. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3833.4599999999996s)]

*  That's a good point. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3838.18s)]
*  It could be some crypto failure. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3839.02s)]
*  Yeah, he launched Mabu coin. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=3840.8199999999997s)]

*  Yeah, he was the only white guy on it. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4091.02s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4092.34s)]
*  It was him, yeah, and they had a. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4093.1800000000003s)]
*  And now he's become an artist. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4095.38s)]
*  Yeah, and now he's an artist. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4096.7s)]
*  But it's just interesting to get all the art [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4098.1s)]
*  out of your system, you know? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4099.9400000000005s)]
*  Because some artists. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4101.1s)]
*  I think that's kind of what he, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4101.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that's what he feels like. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4102.78s)]
*  I saw an interview with him today, sound like the hedgehog. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4104.22s)]
*  They said, why'd you do this? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4105.78s)]
*  He said, for the money. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4106.62s)]
*  What a life, because when Bruce Almighty was coming on, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4109.46s)]
*  he really, he was like the biggest. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4111.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4113.22s)]
*  What about, do you feel like you have to be like, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4114.900000000001s)]
*  because you're kind of like the, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4117.34s)]
*  the it guy, like the it younger guy in Hollywood. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4119.14s)]
*  For sure, for sure. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4124.740000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4125.660000000001s)]
*  I know, yeah. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4126.5s)]
*  But does that feel like, I don't know, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4128.22s)]
*  and I know it's like, do you, how do you, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4131.02s)]
*  and a lot of that is a lot of times curtailed [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4133.700000000001s)]
*  by like the industry, like you're. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4135.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4137.06s)]
*  Like you have a, like I thought you'd come with like, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4137.900000000001s)]
*  in a tank or something. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4140.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4141.22s)]
*  Like you drove over here by yourself. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4142.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4142.9400000000005s)]
*  So definitely kind of, I guess, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4144.62s)]
*  maybe against what I was thinking, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4146.5s)]
*  which doesn't mean anything. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4147.82s)]
*  But do you worry about how do you still be yourself [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4149.9s)]
*  and find yourself at a time when you could be so maneuvered [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4152.7s)]
*  by so many bigger pressures? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4156.259999999999s)]
*  Listen man, not to bring you back to the movie, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4158.46s)]
*  but that's where Bob Dylan's so influential. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4159.98s)]
*  No, this is perfect. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4161.5s)]
*  No, because Bob always followed his path. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4162.34s)]
*  And what's interesting about the movie industry, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4165.0199999999995s)]
*  instead of, like as opposed to the music industry, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4166.98s)]
*  the music industry, you write your own music, you know? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4169.0599999999995s)]
*  And it's direct to the consumer in some sense, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4171.0199999999995s)]
*  like you do whatever the fuck you want. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4174.46s)]
*  And if people are vibing with it, you'll know and whatever. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4175.3s)]
*  In the movie industry, you do kind of have to, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4177.099999999999s)]
*  you gotta be reliable. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4181.3s)]
*  A musician, you show up whenever you want. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4182.82s)]
*  They could be a rock star to show up four hours late. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4184.14s)]
*  If you're three hours late to a movie, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4185.54s)]
*  they gotta call insurance. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4186.66s)]
*  You cost a million dollars now, you'll never work again. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4187.62s)]
*  So there's a part of the job that's obedient in a sense. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4189.9s)]
*  But the best art and the best shit we see is stuff that. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4192.98s)]
*  People showed up for. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4198.42s)]
*  People showed up for, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4199.5s)]
*  but also where they broke rules in a sense. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4200.34s)]
*  I was just talking to you. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4202.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4203.78s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's a fine line. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4204.62s)]
*  And I look at it like this. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4207.139999999999s)]
*  This is my inner Tom Cruise where I want movies to be seen. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4209.9s)]
*  And I don't wanna live an unobedient life, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4213.86s)]
*  but I also want at a time where maybe Hollywood [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4216.86s)]
*  or movie makers got a perception of like [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4222.099999999999s)]
*  sometimes being out of touch or something, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4226.139999999999s)]
*  or definitely like awards type movies. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4227.66s)]
*  I want especially a movie about Bob Dylan. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4230.22s)]
*  I want, in all the movies I work on, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4233.06s)]
*  that's why I did Dune, that's why I did Wonka. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4234.5s)]
*  And I'm proud that those movies, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4235.9400000000005s)]
*  I know I'm not supposed to pat myself on the back, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4237.1s)]
*  but those movies were big. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4238.58s)]
*  Like in the movie industry or the movie business, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4241.02s)]
*  brick and mortar theaters, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4242.9800000000005s)]
*  they don't do the business they once did. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4244.700000000001s)]
*  Some of that's inevitable because of streaming, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4246.46s)]
*  but I wanna put my best foot forward. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4248.14s)]
*  You gotta give back to the industry that gave to you. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4249.780000000001s)]
*  That's really my MO. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4252.58s)]
*  And that's why I'm here. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4253.900000000001s)]
*  You know, otherwise, that's why you can't be [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4257.14s)]
*  the reclusive figure that Bob Dylan or Daniel Day Lewis [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4261.3s)]
*  or these guys were, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4263.46s)]
*  because it's not about the bottom line, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4264.42s)]
*  but the attention isn't guaranteed the way it used to be. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4266.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4270.34s)]
*  I hope this doesn't sound like too inside baseball. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4271.18s)]
*  I want inside baseball. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4272.900000000001s)]
*  I just, you know, you're like a real thinker, you know? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4273.740000000001s)]
*  So it's not like you're gonna give some answer [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4276.38s)]
*  that isn't traveling through your thoughts [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4277.9400000000005s)]
*  and you explaining stuff. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4280.58s)]
*  So that's perfect. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4282.02s)]
*  There's no wrong way to answer it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4282.860000000001s)]
*  It's a weird thing. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4283.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, yeah, and then- [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4285.02s)]
*  Also, I had a full ass real life before my career took off [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4286.78s)]
*  in the East Village in New York. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4289.86s)]
*  So not that my life isn't real now, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4291.34s)]
*  but obviously on these press tours and stuff, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4294.58s)]
*  the days are micromanaged in some way. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4295.94s)]
*  But man, here's the thing. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4297.5s)]
*  That's another thing I say. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4300.42s)]
*  As a musician or as a pop star, whatever, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4301.259999999999s)]
*  your music can be about your erosion of humanity. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4303.3s)]
*  It could be about, hey, I'm driving this car [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4306.74s)]
*  and this is the crazy lifestyle. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4309.54s)]
*  But if you're an actor, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4311.66s)]
*  if you lose your sense of humanity, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4312.5s)]
*  if you lose your stink, for lack of a better word, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4314.66s)]
*  people will see that on screen. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4318.46s)]
*  You do see it on screen. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4319.58s)]
*  Oh, you seem too fancy. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4320.58s)]
*  You seem out of touch. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4321.42s)]
*  Well, people are gonna know. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4322.24s)]
*  That's why the Safdie movie I just did, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4323.08s)]
*  man, he put me through the wringer. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4324.22s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4326.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, I felt like he was testing me early on. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4327.34s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4329.58s)]
*  So when somebody's, like, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4330.42s)]
*  so a director can kind of put you through some fucking shit? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4331.32s)]
*  Yeah, look, Josh knew me since I was 21. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4334.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, Safdie? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4337.0599999999995s)]
*  Safdie, before I was 21. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4337.9s)]
*  Uncut Gems, that's that movie, right? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4339.22s)]
*  Yeah, Uncut Gems. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4340.7s)]
*  That's one of the best movies. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4341.54s)]
*  There you go, man, and good time. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4342.42s)]
*  Good time with Robert Pattinson, he directed it too. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4345.46s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4346.58s)]
*  I'm saving Robert Pattinson for after, for later. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4347.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4349.26s)]
*  But, you know, like early on, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4350.94s)]
*  we had stuff that could have been stunt guys [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4353.44s)]
*  on this movie, on Marty Supreme, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4354.98s)]

*  And part of me was like, this feels like a test, you know? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4359.099999999999s)]
*  And I wanted to show him. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4361.34s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of, you know, the biggest- [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4427.1s)]
*  Calling it Christmas day. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4428.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of, just Christmas. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4429.38s)]
*  Only on Christmas you can see it comes out on Christmas day. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4430.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4433.0199999999995s)]
*  Biggest journey was the music and the voice. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4434.379999999999s)]
*  And also I've never had my phone off the entire movie. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4436.66s)]
*  I had three months- [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4438.98s)]
*  You had your phone off the whole movie. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4439.82s)]
*  Yeah, I had three months to play this guy. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4440.639999999999s)]
*  And then the rest of my life I never get to play him again. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4442.58s)]
*  So I just, I was locked in. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4444.58s)]
*  Also, you're never supposed to say you're competitive, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4446.24s)]
*  but I want, you know, there's been a lot of music biopics. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4450.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4453.9s)]

*  This is a little misconception about actors too and acting. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4461.12s)]
*  You can have a cushy job on a TV show. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4463.219999999999s)]
*  If you don't give a fuck about your work, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4464.96s)]
*  it could be a great lifestyle, right? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4466.08s)]
*  You're making like high six figures, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4468.0599999999995s)]
*  maybe low seven figures, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4469.62s)]
*  and you're just showing up when you want. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4470.98s)]
*  If you give a fuck about what you're doing, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4472.3s)]
*  these are long ass days. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4473.7s)]

*  Look, I know people got it way harder, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4480.94s)]

*  I want to feel it. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4485.46s)]
*  You know, I hope people don't laugh at it. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4486.42s)]
*  I fucking really, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4487.42s)]
*  I feel like I'm the hardest working man. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4488.3s)]
*  Anyway, maybe I shouldn't say that, but. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4490.62s)]
*  You respect what you do. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4492.780000000001s)]

*  I talk about this with friends a lot. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4496.3s)]
*  This is too weird a lifestyle to be. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4497.780000000001s)]
*  Notchelon about. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4501.34s)]

*  If you're not going to go as hard as possible. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4504.66s)]
*  On Marty Supreme, I'm wearing contacts [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4507.38s)]

*  So he gives me real glasses that fuck my eyes up, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4512.46s)]

*  to offset what the glasses are doing. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4517.06s)]

*  No, another misconception about movies, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4830.38s)]
*  as opposed to the academic year, it kind of winds down. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4833.3s)]
*  You're never winding down on a movie. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4835.38s)]
*  You're doing 14 hour days and you go off a cliff, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4836.820000000001s)]
*  then it's done. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4839.18s)]
*  In other words, you don't relax towards the end. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4840.54s)]
*  We were doing a very important scene [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4844.02s)]
*  and it was done forever. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4845.18s)]
*  And yeah, I guess I relaxed a little bit. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4846.58s)]
*  I went on vacation, but I was beat. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4848.3s)]
*  I was working on this for five years. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4849.74s)]

*  Recruiting production assistants. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4866.06s)]
*  Do you think you would have done it more just [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4871.5s)]
*  as five years earlier? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4873.22s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4874.3s)]
*  Also, because I had the experience in my life [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4875.34s)]
*  where I would do interviews and it's a scary time [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4876.7s)]
*  to come up with the internet and stuff. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4880.66s)]
*  You want to get it right. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4882.42s)]
*  And Bob Dylan, his early press conferences, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4883.34s)]
*  he was confrontational. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4885.58s)]
*  He was basically a dick. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4887.34s)]
*  And I thought there was something [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4888.78s)]
*  really inspiring about that. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4890.02s)]
*  Not that I ever wanted to be like that, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4891.3s)]
*  but I just thought it was so different [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4892.900000000001s)]
*  than how people are now. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4894.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4895.1s)]
*  Where you're just automatically cordial. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4895.9400000000005s)]
*  You just assume. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4897.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, you got to be, man. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4898.900000000001s)]
*  A, I'm not a pretty cordial guy. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4899.900000000001s)]
*  But B, God forbid, you don't want to be, anyway. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4902.9400000000005s)]

*  oh, if you're tremendously bored [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4908.38s)]
*  and not watching Mr. B stuff, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4911.3s)]
*  watch the early Bob Dylan San Francisco press conferences. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4912.46s)]
*  I just thought, so anyway, five years working on it, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4916.58s)]
*  I got a better sense on the other side of it. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4919.5s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is why [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4921.900000000001s)]
*  he would have carried himself like that. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4923.14s)]
*  He had some wherewithal I didn't have [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4924.9800000000005s)]
*  in his early 20s where somebody said, how do you do it? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4926.46s)]
*  He goes, basically, I didn't want to tell anyone. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4928.660000000001s)]
*  Me, maybe because whatever, the acting bone, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4931.1s)]
*  somebody says, how do you do it? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4933.900000000001s)]
*  And you're so desperate for that pat on your back. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4934.740000000001s)]
*  And you go, this is how I did it. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4937.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4939.26s)]

*  Like you were saying earlier about acting, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4944.14s)]
*  you can keep doing it for a long time. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4945.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=4947.26s)]

*  Chet has a new country album [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvc3RZQF3I&t=5006.0s)]
