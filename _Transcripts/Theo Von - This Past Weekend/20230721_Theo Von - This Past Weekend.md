*  How far apart we are on so many things [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1647.0s)]
*  How they plead poverty? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1650.6000000000001s)]
*  That they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1653.08s)]
*  to their ceos [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1657.88s)]
*  It is disgusting shame on them [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1660.6000000000001s)]
*  They stand on the wrong side of history at this very moment [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1664.68s)]
*  We stand in solidarity [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1671.16s)]
*  in [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1674.1200000000001s)]
*  unprecedented unity [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1675.46s)]
*  Our union and our sister unions and the unions around the world [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1678.0400000000002s)]
*  Are standing by us [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1684.5200000000002s)]
*  As well as other labor unions that's good [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1686.68s)]
*  That's interesting, huh? I mean, I feel like she really kind of I feel like she you definitely feel what she's saying [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1692.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they got millions and they can't give the writer some I know [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1697.4s)]
*  The residuals thing is a bummer [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1701.48s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of it goes back to just the history of people not getting residuals [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1704.36s)]
*  You know, it's like all those years of people on shows and you hear that they don't have they didn't make any money from you [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1708.6s)]
*  Know like you hear that a lot about the cast from like saved by the bell and stuff like that [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1715.48s)]
*  Like they were on those hit shows, right and they didn't [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1719.56s)]
*  That it just wasn't part of the deals. I know so I think a lot of you have that old energy [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1724.52s)]
*  That's built up. So she went through all that, you know [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1729.08s)]
*  Um, the problem is on twitter you have certain people that come out against her and are like, oh here's a millionaire [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1732.28s)]
*  You know trying to say what what the regular person wants and it's like [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1738.2s)]
*  but still somebody has to um [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1742.68s)]
*  Somebody has to speak up, you know, yeah. Yeah, and I think they'll be fine, but [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1746.04s)]
*  That sucks to be a writer and just like ah, we're not gonna we're not gonna pay you [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1751.0s)]
*  Well also because a lot of the writers they work on spec, you know, they do a project first and bring it forward [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1755.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so I think when you partner in the fact they're doing all of that work [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1762.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then which some of those things never lead anywhere [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1766.76s)]
*  True, how many friends do we have that have probably written five scripts? I've written three [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1770.44s)]
*  Scripts i've written a million packets. Yeah, snl whatever tv show. Yeah, and they just steal your jokes. Yes [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1775.24s)]

*  I know you actually have to sign a thing when you turn in a packet that says hey [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1785.0s)]
*  This is not yours anymore. You send it to us and you're like, that's that's my best sketch. I need that [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1788.2s)]

*  It's a it's a sick business and there's never any accountability [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1800.52s)]
*  You don't know once you send that packet off what happens. Yeah, and then now you have all these [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1804.36s)]
*  Yeah, you have a lot of actors and I guess they're um [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1808.6s)]
*  They're worried about ai which makes sense. You know, they're worried about all of that ai is getting good, man [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1811.8s)]
*  I uh people send me jokes that they put an ai in my voice and i'm like that's pretty good [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1817.72s)]
*  That's better than anything i've ever had [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  Also, i'm a robotic guy who tells jokes wow now ai is taking my shit [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1825.4s)]
*  It's a good point, huh? Yeah scary, but I think maybe that's also one of the reasons why people want to come see something [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  That's real [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1836.0400000000002s)]
*  I want to come see a human. I want to i'm sick of talking to a robot when I need my plane ticket fixed i'm sick of [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1838.44s)]
*  Not being able to say anything at work. Everything is like like goes into like um [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1846.2s)]
*  Like what the rules of civility are and stuff at work [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1852.3600000000001s)]
*  And I want to be able to come out and fucking you know, hear somebody possibly drop an in bomb [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1855.72s)]
*  Yes, yes, and like little things you go unhoused. That's what we call homeless people now [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1861.48s)]
*  So you're at work or you're in the shower going unhoused. What the fuck is that? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1865.96s)]
*  But you can't say anything at work. So then you go see the you go to the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1868.76s)]

*  No, i'm not one of those guys. I can sit on an hour for a while and just keep honing [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1886.04s)]
*  I think jokes are better when you they marinate over you over a long period of time [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1890.36s)]
*  I think people put stuff out too quick. Yeah, you know, I think louis fucked that up with the hour a year thing [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1894.2s)]

*  Yeah, that was a lot of pressure. Yeah, but I think people just I think you're right. That's why this is even popular [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1915.2399999999998s)]
*  Talking all we're doing is talking having a conversation which we used to do all the time and that kind of even went away [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1921.3s)]
*  Oh, that's true. Huh? People don't get together. Yeah, like when do you [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1927.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, some of the biggest conversations now are when you hear people talking with like some lost kid that came with a ring doorbell [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1931.4s)]
*  Cam, yeah [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1937.72s)]

*  You know them, but you're not like hanging out every day and there's that weird moment of awkwardness [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1948.12s)]
*  Everything in my body is going ah, get out of here. Look at your phone [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1952.68s)]
*  Put your headphones in yeah something but if you just get over that it's a blast [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1955.96s)]
*  But we don't want to get over that because comfort everything is so comfortable now [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1961.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there's definitely that moment like it's like when you're on a diet and they come down the aisle at a plane with the cookies [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1964.8400000000001s)]

*  It's hard to get back to normal once you're addicted like that [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1993.32s)]
*  Do you ever look up from your phone and you don't even know kind of where you're there's like a half a second [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=1995.96s)]

*  but one of the tougher things about [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2620.06s)]
*  getting popularity is [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2622.2999999999997s)]
*  You spend a lot of your time defending yourself. Yes, like hiding myself. Yes [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2624.4599999999996s)]
*  When I get off the plane today, I go and kind of stand like in a space away from where I know people won't be [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2630.06s)]
*  Um, you know just like little things like that where you're just monitoring [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2635.74s)]

*  You know, I have to take care of myself and make sure i'm fed and whatever [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2661.66s)]
*  You can't spend all your time meeting people, right? Yeah, and part of you would like to there's that part of you [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2665.66s)]

*  Like on my like on on my podcast we talk a lot about there's a lot of like people that struggle with stuff [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2824.7s)]
*  So, oh, yeah, we go [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2830.14s)]

*  Yeah, then that can be a little bit different, you know, that's a little different [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=2849.2599999999998s)]

*  Very exhausting because as a modern day person you can't do anything to go into the past [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5273.5199999999995s)]
*  I know I know it's tough and I get it I get the anger [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5279.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5282.240000000001s)]
*  If I could go into the past like you know 600 years ago or something and work for the coast guard or whatever sure [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5282.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I would have shut all that stuff down. Yeah. Yeah, but you think maybe but it was so normal then [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5287.52s)]
*  You might have just gone with it. It's like being a nazi [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5293.92s)]
*  I don't know. I think I would have I don't think I would have either just because i'm I want to be liked [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5296.8s)]
*  So I don't care what you look like. Yeah, i'm still gonna tap dance for you. Yeah, that's a good point, you know [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5301.200000000001s)]
*  But yeah, that is tough, uh, but do you think that uh [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5306.8s)]
*  And then I think the hatred and stuff like that. It just gets stuck in d. Sometimes you get stuck in dna, you know [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5310.719999999999s)]
*  of course, I think some of that stuff takes so like [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5315.84s)]
*  If your grandparents went through a ton of pain or an unfair life [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5318.48s)]
*  Then I think that gets in the dna and it takes generations for it to pass through right? Yeah, I agree [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5323.76s)]
*  But we'll find any way to hate another group. It doesn't have to just be skin color. You're like [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5329.599999999999s)]

*  You know the left and right [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5344.08s)]

*  Yeah, you know, I think a lot about that. Is that just part of nature? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5351.12s)]
*  Because nature is that too, you know a zoo if you if you took the cages down in a zoo [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5354.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, half those animals would immediately kill the other half. Exactly [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5360.5599999999995s)]

*  We had to survive like that for hundreds of years [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5387.04s)]
*  And sometimes I wonder do we ever get to a point where there isn't any of that or is that just [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5390.0s)]
*  Nate, you know like will that just always be nature and this idea? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5395.84s)]
*  That one day everything will be completely harmonious. Well, it's better now than it's ever been [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5400.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think especially with young people you see that definitely definitely like you'll see young kids of like different ethnicities and stuff [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5406.56s)]
*  Hanging out and it's totally chill. Yeah, i'm like, holy you don't even realize this guy's a chinaman [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5412.160000000001s)]

*  You literally have to know math like you have to be able to divide. Yes and figure it out [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5426.18s)]
*  But now it's it used to be racial divide or gay divide or men women divide now. It's [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5431.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, you disagree with my ideology or whatever [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5437.22s)]
*  Yeah, you're no friend of mine. Yeah, you know, it's it's all become opinion-based now instead of color-based [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5440.42s)]
*  So we still have hatred. We just put it into a different gutter [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5445.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's just kind of you know, that's the thing being it being alive is just interesting because you're like [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5451.78s)]
*  Okay, will this kind of stuff always be there? I know I just think you can't get rid of everything [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5456.74s)]
*  And it's all cyclical like I saw this thing in the 70s [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5462.42s)]
*  We're like battle of the sexes men and women aren't getting along and you're like, oh that's just like now we're not that different. Yeah [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5464.9s)]

*  From the wolf days [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5489.38s)]
*  That's just in the dna. So that shit is imprinted [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5491.14s)]
*  Yeah [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5494.42s)]
*  So i'm just saying like we're always gonna be tribal [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5495.46s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I think about this like the other day. I don't like being in traffic that much, right? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5499.22s)]
*  And if it's on the interstate sometimes and there's a hold up i'll go around the side [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5504.66s)]
*  Sure, right. I'll just go i'm willing to get up there and see the cop and he's like, hey you're going to jail [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5510.18s)]
*  That's fine. I'd rather go to jail than sit back there. Yeah and wonder why somebody's holding me up. I'm with you [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5514.9s)]
*  But then I realized the other day what if [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5521.94s)]
*  If like 20 cars just said you know what? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5524.26s)]
*  Fuck it. We're not doing the rules anymore. Yeah [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5527.22s)]
*  How far after that tipping point does that you know, like if one police precinct gets taken over [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5530.5s)]
*  by a group of fucking [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5536.58s)]
*  um [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5538.34s)]
*  Anarchists or whatever. Oh, yeah, it's happened how like [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5539.3s)]
*  How like it the scale doesn't have to tip much before everything goes into anarchy? Oh, dude [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5542.66s)]
*  It's so true [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5547.62s)]
*  Uh, we had a hurricane in new york a couple years ago and all the power went out [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5548.58s)]

*  It happened in 20 minutes. It went to full chaos. Yeah [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5561.38s)]
*  Like it's so fragile the line that we're on of like oregon like I know [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5566.179999999999s)]
*  It's basically lines in the road. Yes, they keep us in shape, but it's real easy to to drive over that line [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5571.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I realized. I was like, oh I can just do this [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5577.62s)]
*  Like of course I can face some repercussions [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5579.94s)]
*  But if everybody right now decided to do this then what are the cops gonna do right if everybody if [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=5582.099999999999s)]

*  Do because that's a weird thing you wouldn't think to teach your kid. Yeah, but how do you teach being proud? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6145.48s)]
*  You know like I have I get I don't get pride with comedy even though we should look you've built an empire [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6151.56s)]
*  You got your big house with the studio and the specials and money and all this [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6156.6s)]
*  But then that does nothing for me and then if i'm at a party and somebody goes, that's a good question [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6161.64s)]

*  As I did to show my apartment that we lived in when I was a kid just the different kind of shame [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6192.679999999999s)]

*  You want to be in the middle? We want to blend [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6217.64s)]
*  If you're poor but like look at the poor loser and if you're rich like look at this asshole. Yeah [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6220.44s)]

*  Of course still is when they found those submarine queefs [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6230.12s)]
*  They were like all these poor guys and they go. Hey, they're billionaires and they go. Ah, fuck them [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6232.92s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, you know because I think also I know I could easily the part of me [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6252.92s)]
*  That's the poor guy will always is always going to be there [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6257.4800000000005s)]
*  Of course the only things that are easier is just knowing that my rent will be paid and then i'm going to have food [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6260.12s)]
*  but outside of that it's like how do I [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6265.32s)]
*  I want to I want to figure out better things to do with earning money or with making things fair in the world [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6268.6s)]
*  I think I don't know. Yeah, but do you ever think if you had if you started feeling proud you might work less [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6274.36s)]
*  Like that non-pride is kind of motivating you to chase it. Yeah [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6280.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there's something about like the desire to want to do things that you're so fortunate that that's in you [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6285.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's it's kind of a double-edged sword because you're never happy with your work [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gPPpjTp1w&t=6292.2s)]
