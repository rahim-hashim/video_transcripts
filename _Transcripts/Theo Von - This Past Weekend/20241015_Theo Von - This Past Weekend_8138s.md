*  and almost tender and very vulnerable [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=105.38s)]
*  and just kinda humble, you know? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=109.78s)]
*  Which is not how usually he comes across. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=114.22000000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I was trying to just talk to him [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  about something that felt pretty normal, you know? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=119.42s)]
*  Yeah, but he's also expressed interest in you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=121.62s)]
*  and your brother and... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=124.30000000000001s)]

*  You know, I think I... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, when you read further in the book, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=132.82s)]
*  I actually talk about him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=134.58s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=135.94s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm just looking forward to that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=143.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, especially like just as a regular person [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  in the world, you wanna try to get a feel for somebody. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  I use a poster boy for trauma. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=151.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=153.5s)]
*  In my view. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=154.34s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot of it there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, his brother had addiction and like, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  and even him, I think, trying to learn about addiction, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=161.18s)]
*  I wish I could, I wish I would have stayed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  in that conversation a little bit more with Donald [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  and tried to share some thoughts and things that I had. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=170.74s)]
*  Not thoughts, but a little bit more explanation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=174.46s)]
*  about addiction from my own perspective. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=176.9s)]
*  Yeah, that would have been an interesting conversation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=179.7s)]
*  Yeah, just to let him know that it wasn't something [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=182.66s)]
*  his brother, like, it wasn't like his brother [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=184.62s)]
*  just couldn't stop drinking. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=187.9s)]
*  No. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=189.38s)]
*  You know, that he had other things inside of him [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=190.22s)]
*  that prevented him from doing that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=192.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=194.38s)]
*  Yeah, and I really wish that if I could go back, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=195.22s)]
*  but one of the things that's been tough for me [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  is just you get into certain conversations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=201.02s)]
*  and I'm still learning how to be in conversation sometimes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=201.86s)]
*  So sometimes it's, you know, you're learning, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  you know, you're learning on the stove. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=207.38s)]
*  We're always learning. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=209.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we're always learning. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=211.06s)]
*  Gabor, that's how you say it? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  Gabor. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=214.9s)]
*  Gabor. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=215.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=216.56s)]

*  Thank you, my pleasure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=220.3s)]

*  Trauma, Illness, and Healing in a Toxic Culture. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=225.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=229.5s)]
*  You believe that we are kind of a sick culture. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=231.38s)]
*  What makes you believe that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=236.54s)]
*  Well, or like what proof do you have of that? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=240.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, so 70% of American adults [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=242.82s)]
*  are at least on one medication. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=245.94s)]
*  70%, 40% are on two medications or more. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=247.54s)]
*  The number of children being diagnosed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=252.38s)]
*  with all manner of dysfunctions, disorders, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=254.1s)]
*  mental health challenges like ADHD, self-cutting, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=257.7s)]
*  addictions, anxiety, depression, childhood suicide [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  keeps going up. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=267.7s)]
*  In the United States, annually, twice as many people die [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=269.38s)]
*  of overdoses as died in the Iraq, Vietnam, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=273.58s)]
*  and Afghan wars put together. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=277.98s)]
*  This is every year. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=281.58s)]
*  The life expectancy, particularly of white men, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=283.26s)]
*  has gone down due to suicide and drug overdoses. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=288.38s)]
*  I mean, I could go, the number of autoimmune, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  I could go on forever, but just statistically, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=295.66s)]
*  there's more and more evidence of illness and dysfunction. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=300.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=302.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the overdosing alone is unbelievable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  The fact that that's even just become a common thing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=306.54s)]
*  in our society is, it's heartbreaking for so many. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=310.18s)]
*  It's heartbreaking for so many and so many people's families, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=314.22s)]
*  just the residual effect of suicide or overdose. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=316.62s)]
*  It's like, we don't even think about, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=319.54s)]
*  those numbers don't even take into the ripple effect [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=322.1s)]
*  of people losing a loved one. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=325.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=327.86s)]
*  I mean, the families that are being devastated. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=328.7s)]
*  And I mean, I used to work with what is North America's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=331.66s)]
*  most concentrated area of drug use [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=336.3s)]
*  in Vancouver, British Columbia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=338.26s)]
*  And I know you were there a month ago. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we went down on Catchings, is that right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=341.42s)]
*  Hastings. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=343.74s)]
*  Hastings, yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=344.58s)]
*  We went down on Hastings just to take a drive and see. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=345.42s)]
*  Well, so that's where I used to work. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=347.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=349.06s)]
*  For 12 years as a physician. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=350.46s)]
*  And everybody down there was severely traumatized [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=351.98s)]
*  in childhood and their addictions were all a response [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=356.98s)]
*  to immense emotional pain that they didn't know [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  how else to handle. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=364.41999999999996s)]
*  Not to mention the racial aspect, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=366.62s)]
*  like 30% of my clients were indigenous, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=369.58s)]
*  whereas they only make up 5% of the Canadian population. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=372.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  So the more you suffer either socially or individually, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=375.62s)]
*  the more likely you are to escape in the soothing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=379.86s)]
*  and the relief that drugs or other addictions offer. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=384.62s)]
*  So if you look at American society, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=388.1s)]
*  you're gonna be asking, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=390.26s)]
*  why are so many people having to escape from reality? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=391.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=394.58s)]
*  And we're gonna get into good stuff. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=396.22s)]
*  I have a good plan today, I'm prepared. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  Some stuff, I have some questions that I even wrote down [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=399.98s)]
*  that are on cards just because I wanna make sure [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=402.18s)]
*  that we get the best information that we can [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  for our guests today. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=406.66s)]
*  I think it's really important. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  One of the things that you talk about in the book [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=409.94s)]
*  that's causing a lot of sickness is trauma. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=412.94s)]
*  And then more specifically, unprocessed trauma. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=415.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=418.14s)]
*  Help me define those a little bit for our audience. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=419.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=422.22s)]
*  So trauma is one of these words that everybody throws around. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=423.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's a buzzword. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=426.38s)]
*  Yeah, so let's just define it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=427.42s)]
*  So trauma literally comes from the Greek word for wound [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=429.9s)]
*  or wounding. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=432.62s)]
*  So trauma is a wound, whether it's a physical wound [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=433.44s)]
*  or a psychological wound. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=436.26s)]
*  In this case, we're talking about emotional wounds [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  that haven't healed. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=439.86s)]
*  So trauma is an unhealed wound [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=440.98s)]
*  that you sustain in childhood, but then it stays with you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=443.14s)]
*  And it directly causes inflammation in the body, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=446.98s)]
*  it affects all your genes function [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=451.46s)]
*  or your chromosomes function. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=453.62s)]
*  It stresses your organs, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=455.38s)]
*  it creates all kinds of physiological problems. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  On emotional level, it instills a lot of pain in you [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=460.58s)]
*  that you try to escape from. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=465.82s)]
*  And one of the ways you try to escape, for example, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=467.7s)]
*  is through drug use or to other kinds of addictions [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=469.78s)]
*  or through self-cutting or bulimia [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=473.29999999999995s)]
*  or any pornography or whatever. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=475.17999999999995s)]
*  It also makes you suppress, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=478.64s)]
*  disconnects you from your own emotions [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=482.28s)]
*  because when a child is being traumatized, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=484.44s)]
*  it's too painful to connect to themselves. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=487.12s)]
*  So they disconnect. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=489.26s)]
*  And that disconnect then causes all kinds of problems [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  in terms of illness, mental and physical. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=493.64s)]
*  So the impacts of trauma are vast [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  and quite under-recognized. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=498.8s)]
*  Indeed, and you talk about trauma also [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=502.84s)]
*  as not being seen and known. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=505.28s)]
*  Yeah, so here we have to understand [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=507.88s)]
*  what are the needs of the human child. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=512.9599999999999s)]
*  So everybody understands that the child needs to be [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=514.8399999999999s)]
*  physically cared for, cleaned up, fed, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=518.6s)]
*  and sheltered and so on. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=521.0s)]
*  Children, according to evolution, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=522.8399999999999s)]
*  also have emotional needs that they're born with. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=524.92s)]
*  One of them is being just accepted and valued [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=528.04s)]
*  for exactly who they are. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  And being seen rather than being forced to be [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=532.16s)]
*  something that the parents want them to be. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=537.04s)]
*  And a lot of parents in this society, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=539.56s)]
*  not because they don't love their kids, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=542.54s)]
*  but because they're so stressed, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=544.38s)]
*  have just a hard time seeing their kids. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=545.92s)]
*  I had trouble seeing my kids. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=548.28s)]
*  And that had an impact on them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  And not because I wasn't devoted, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=552.12s)]
*  because I didn't love them, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=554.0s)]
*  just because of my own trauma, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  I couldn't even see myself. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=558.04s)]
*  Oh, man, I can relate so much to that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny, because I work as a comedian. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=565.1199999999999s)]
*  And I grew up in kind of a traumatic home. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=569.16s)]
*  Like my mom was very busy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=572.4799999999999s)]
*  She had four children. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I feel like she never looked at me. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=575.88s)]
*  I feel like she never kind of put her hands on me. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=580.56s)]
*  I feel like she just, and she didn't know how, I guess. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=583.16s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=586.68s)]
*  Yeah, I just always felt like I wasn't seen. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=587.68s)]
*  And how do you suppose that affected you? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=590.16s)]
*  Well, I ended up becoming a comedian. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=593.12s)]
*  I felt like I had to find some way to be seen. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=595.56s)]
*  I had to do something to get someone to see me, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=599.36s)]
*  because I needed to survive. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=604.92s)]
*  I needed to feel alive. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=606.36s)]
*  You know, it's funny about comedians. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=608.52s)]
*  May I say something about them? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=609.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=610.76s)]
*  I looked at the back of a number of comedians. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=611.6s)]
*  What you're talking about is like a common theme. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=614.12s)]
*  I looked at Robin Williams, who's this brilliant, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=616.44s)]
*  brilliant comic. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  And one of the reasons he developed this humor [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=621.4000000000001s)]
*  was to make his mother laugh [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=625.32s)]
*  as a way of having his mother pay attention to him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=627.12s)]
*  Gilda Radner, who died of ovarian cancer, the same thing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=629.44s)]
*  So that they had the innate talent, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=634.2s)]
*  but then they used that talent to be seen and valued [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=637.72s)]
*  where they should have been valued with or without talent. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=642.72s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=645.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  A few years ago, I thought it's like, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=648.0s)]
*  I'm kind of a late bloomer. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=650.6s)]
*  Like I only realized that, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  like I go to recovery meetings and stuff like that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=654.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm in AA. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=656.96s)]
*  And I only realized a few years ago, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  it started to hit me like, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=660.5200000000001s)]
*  did I even want to be a comedian? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=662.44s)]
*  Or did I just at some early point [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=665.0s)]
*  develop having to get attention? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=669.72s)]
*  Because I need, you know, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  and then, so if that's the case, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=676.4s)]
*  then who did I really want it? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=678.12s)]
*  You know, what would I have been if I didn't do that? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=679.5600000000001s)]
*  And not saying that I'm not grateful [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=683.76s)]
*  and I don't love being a comedian. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=687.08s)]
*  It's been a blessing, but it's like, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  if I created that, okay, I have to be this thing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=693.48s)]
*  for you to see me, then who created that? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, like was there a different me [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=700.52s)]
*  that was supposed to be there, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=702.92s)]
*  but then I created this new me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=705.28s)]
*  That's the dilemma for so many of us, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  is that as a result of childhood wounding, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=709.76s)]
*  we have to make ourselves into something [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  that the world will accept and value. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=715.36s)]
*  Like look, in my case, I love having been a physician. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=718.8s)]
*  And that's my calling. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=723.1999999999999s)]
*  But the big part of it wasn't just [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=725.4799999999999s)]
*  that I wanted to help humanity or heal people. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  It's also needed to be important. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=730.24s)]
*  Why do they need to be important? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  Because as an infant, I got the message that I wasn't. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=734.48s)]
*  And so now then, and that creates a kind of an addiction [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=737.24s)]
*  because you have to keep proving to yourself [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=742.0s)]
*  how important you are and how valuable you are. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  But nobody should have to prove how valuable they are. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=745.64s)]
*  That's just our birthright that we exist. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=748.0400000000001s)]
*  We have the right to be here. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=750.52s)]
*  Yeah, that God chose us or that the energies [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=751.88s)]
*  of the world chose us and said, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=754.24s)]
*  I'm gonna put you here with a fine pen. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna put you in the world. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=758.84s)]
*  And I did it on purpose. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  And the world, it was built to take care of you [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=762.92s)]
*  and to nurture you and to make you feel welcome as you are. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=766.24s)]
*  And if you actually look at, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=771.0s)]
*  and this has been studied quite extensively, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=773.56s)]
*  how indigenous people or tribal peoples close to the land [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  rear their kids, that's exactly how they rear their kids. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=781.0s)]
*  Like they give their children a deep sense of acceptance. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=784.76s)]
*  They hold them, they carry them everywhere. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, all the paintings you see of Native Americans, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=790.76s)]
*  they always, somebody's got a kid on them. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=793.1199999999999s)]
*  They got them in a knapsack, they got them right, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  they got them. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=797.76s)]
*  And they tend not to hit their kids. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=798.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you never seen a movie about a Native American [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=800.3599999999999s)]
*  beating his children, I don't think. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=803.1199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=804.1999999999999s)]
*  So I mean, so what you're describing [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=805.3599999999999s)]
*  is actually how we evolved. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=807.4799999999999s)]
*  And part of the toxicity in my view of our culture [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=809.52s)]
*  is we've gone so far away from our nature [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=812.4s)]
*  when it comes to how we rear children. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  And again, not because of lack of parental devotion, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=818.0s)]
*  but because of so much parental stress. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=821.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=823.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think that was it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=824.28s)]
*  My mom couldn't see us [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=825.6s)]
*  because she had other things she had to see first. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=826.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=828.72s)]
*  And you know, and not just me, but so many people. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=829.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we've created a society, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=833.16s)]
*  or our society has created a way of life [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=835.76s)]
*  where now it's like both parents work in so many cases. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=838.84s)]
*  So, and that alone just feels like [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=843.52s)]
*  it just shouldn't be that way. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=848.0s)]
*  It's like. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=849.64s)]
*  Well, if you look at, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=850.48s)]
*  throughout evolution, through millions of years, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=852.16s)]
*  and hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=855.24s)]
*  children were always with their parents. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=859.28s)]
*  That's how nature designed it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=861.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=863.2s)]
*  Now, if that's not possible in today's society, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=864.04s)]
*  at least then we have to compensate for it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=867.2s)]
*  But we've forgotten that children need that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=869.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=872.68s)]
*  So now when they've extended the daycares and schools, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=873.52s)]
*  it's all about behavior, and it's all about fitting in, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  not about accepting the child and nurturing the child, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  innate sense of who they are. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=884.76s)]
*  So we all end up disconnected from ourselves. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=888.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=891.16s)]
*  And then we get to a certain stage in life, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=892.0s)]
*  we're wondering, whose life am I leading anyway? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=892.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=894.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=896.56s)]
*  Yeah, and it's funny you say like fitting in. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=897.68s)]
*  It's like, yeah, like your child's not fitting in [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=899.52s)]
*  because it's two puzzle pieces or the parents, you know? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=902.0s)]
*  Or the family. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=906.72s)]
*  That's, and not to say it shouldn't be able to spend time [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=907.56s)]
*  with other children and be in, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=910.52s)]
*  and that our schools are bad or anything, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=912.16s)]
*  but it's the fact that they need to fit in there first, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=914.32s)]
*  and then I think it's probably easier for children [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=919.64s)]
*  to fit in in other places in the world. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=921.76s)]
*  Well, that's, but the fitting in happens naturally [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=924.0s)]
*  when you're accepted. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=928.48s)]
*  You know, listen, the schools, I'll tell you something. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=930.4s)]
*  One of the, I'm talking science here, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=933.9599999999999s)]
*  one of the essential needs of all mammals is play. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=937.36s)]
*  In our brain, there's circuitry for play. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=942.64s)]
*  You can see it, dolphins play, little elephants play, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=945.0799999999999s)]
*  bear cubs, lion cubs, puppies, kittens, they all play. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=948.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=952.4s)]
*  Play is essential for brain development. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=953.24s)]
*  It's far more important than academic learning. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  So then the schools, they have to be a lot more play, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=958.16s)]
*  a lot more freedom for the kids to be themselves, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=961.04s)]
*  a lot more freedom to move around, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  and then those kids will be naturally curious [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=964.8s)]
*  and interested in learning, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=967.8399999999999s)]
*  but here we try to put the cart before the horse. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=969.28s)]
*  We try and stuff them full of knowledge, skills, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=972.68s)]
*  and behavior or control, rather than, again, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=975.8s)]
*  promoting the conditions for healthy brain development. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=981.52s)]
*  So the schools actually, they intend well, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=984.12s)]
*  but they really don't get it when it comes to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=987.0s)]
*  what do children actually need? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=989.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's just an, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=992.08s)]
*  and that's just part of it's like our whole society is, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=993.24s)]
*  you know, I wonder sometimes where we, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=996.48s)]
*  did we go completely off the rails in a direction [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=999.92s)]
*  or a series of directions, you know, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1004.36s)]
*  that have kind of put us where we are. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1007.48s)]
*  I want to get this statement right, right here. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1010.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1012.32s)]
*  Why is a trauma event different from other stressful events? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1013.72s)]
*  Like what makes it a trauma? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1017.28s)]
*  Like some events could be traumatic for some people, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1019.0s)]
*  and the same event not traumatic for others. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1022.2s)]
*  What exactly is it about the mind, body, soul [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1024.52s)]
*  that makes the event traumatic? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1026.92s)]
*  Or like what is the mechanism? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1028.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1030.3600000000001s)]
*  Great question. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1031.64s)]
*  So every traumatic event is stressful, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1032.6000000000001s)]
*  but not every stressful event is traumatic. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1036.4s)]
*  So, you invite me on your show, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1039.24s)]
*  and for some reason I don't show up, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1044.84s)]
*  and you had this studio arranged, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1049.2s)]
*  that might stress you, but it doesn't traumatize you. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1051.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1053.84s)]
*  It doesn't leave you with a permanent wound. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1054.68s)]
*  So it's traumatic if it leaves you with a wound, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1056.24s)]
*  and if that wound leaves you more constricted [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1059.04s)]
*  and more afraid and more suspicious, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  and less comfortable with yourself, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1064.0s)]
*  more hostile to other people, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1066.92s)]
*  less comfortable in the world, then it's traumatic. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1071.48s)]
*  Not every stressful event will have that effect, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1075.0s)]
*  but if it does, then it's traumatic. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1078.68s)]
*  If it makes a wound. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1081.04s)]
*  If it makes a wound, that's what makes it traumatic. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1082.28s)]
*  Because a wound is sensitive, even if you think of a wound, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1084.0s)]
*  and if it's not healed properly, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1087.04s)]
*  then it's always a problem. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1089.48s)]
*  Well, there's two, yeah, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1090.88s)]
*  and there's two ways a wound can show up. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1092.2s)]
*  One is just an open wound, and if you touch it, ow. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1095.96s)]
*  So I have certain emotional wounds, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1099.32s)]
*  and well into my 70s or even, I'm 80 now, you know. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1101.44s)]
*  Same as- [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1108.4s)]
*  Oh, you look great. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1109.24s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  It's all the Botox. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1111.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1112.24s)]
*  And the adrenaline. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1113.0800000000002s)]
*  No, it's, and in my 55-year-old marriage with my wife, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1115.28s)]
*  she might say something or react in some way [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1121.16s)]
*  that touches an old wound, and all of a sudden, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1125.16s)]
*  I'm not this 80-year-old guy. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1127.84s)]
*  I'm this one-year-old kid responding, you know, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1129.84s)]
*  because that wound is sort of, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1132.6s)]
*  I'm not giving an excuse here. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1133.8s)]
*  No. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1135.48s)]
*  I'm just saying that that's the challenge, you know. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1136.32s)]
*  So in one sense, a wound is a, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1138.76s)]
*  a trauma is an open wound that you touch it, ow. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1142.72s)]
*  That's the one thing. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1146.0s)]
*  But then the other thing that happens to wounds [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1147.32s)]
*  is they scar over. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1149.08s)]
*  Now scar tissue is thick, it's hard, it doesn't grow. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1150.72s)]
*  It has no nerve ending, so it's insensitive. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1155.36s)]
*  So we get hardened. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  And- [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1160.48s)]
*  Why is it you can either get extremely sensitive [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1161.32s)]
*  or very hardened? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1162.72s)]
*  Or both. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1163.72s)]
*  Or both. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1164.56s)]
*  Depending on, you know, and when you talk about [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1165.3799999999999s)]
*  hardened criminals, guess what hardened them? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1167.76s)]
*  Is that they were so wounded and sheltered. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1172.4399999999998s)]
*  Again, I'm not making excuses. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1174.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm just telling you what the science shows. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1180.04s)]
*  And so then the question is then how do we treat each other [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  in a society where so many of us carry wounds? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1185.8799999999999s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about unprocessed trauma. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1189.8s)]
*  So you talk about emotional isolation [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1192.0s)]
*  as being something that really negatively nurtures [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1195.08s)]
*  unprocessed trauma. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  So once you're hurt as a child, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1203.84s)]
*  you tend not to trust other people. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1207.08s)]
*  So you could be in the middle of a crowd [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1209.8s)]
*  and be laughing and interacting, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1211.76s)]
*  but still feel quite alone emotionally. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1215.6s)]
*  Maybe you've had that feeling. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1218.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1219.6s)]
*  You know, and that emotional isolation itself then [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1220.4399999999998s)]
*  has effects on your body and on your mind. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  So the people who are lonely, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1226.04s)]
*  and the US surgeon general, Dr. Admiral Vivek Murthy, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1228.8s)]
*  just issued a paper on loneliness in the United States. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1233.64s)]
*  And loneliness, and there's an epidemic of loneliness. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1237.8000000000002s)]
*  People are describing us as lonely in much higher numbers [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1241.0800000000002s)]
*  as they did 20, 40 years ago. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1244.8400000000001s)]
*  Now loneliness is as much of a risk factor [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1247.64s)]
*  for physiological illness as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1250.6000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1254.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1255.3200000000002s)]
*  So loneliness is both a manifestation of trauma [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1256.16s)]
*  and a cause of tremendous stress, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1260.8400000000001s)]
*  which then undermines physiological and mental health. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1262.84s)]
*  Okay, say that to me one more time. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1265.9599999999998s)]
*  So loneliness is both an outcome of trauma. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1267.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's an outcome of trauma. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1270.48s)]
*  So something traumatic happened, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1271.52s)]
*  it wasn't processed properly, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1273.8s)]
*  and then now you will feel lonely. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1276.48s)]
*  You will feel lonely, you will isolate. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1279.8799999999999s)]
*  Because look, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1281.52s)]
*  if I am always being a nice guy so that you will like me, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  but inside I'm feeling all these emotions [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1290.56s)]
*  that I'm not sharing with you, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1293.2s)]
*  that's pretty lonely, even though you might like me [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1295.2s)]
*  because I'm showing you this nice side of myself. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1297.8s)]
*  Right, that's not really me. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  That's not me. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1300.6799999999998s)]
*  There was a study done in Australia, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1301.52s)]
*  where at least, I used to work in palliative care [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1303.3999999999999s)]
*  as a doctor looking after dying people. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1306.28s)]
*  In Australia, there was a palliative care nurse [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1308.36s)]
*  who wrote a book called The Top Five Regrets of Dying People. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1311.24s)]
*  These were people that were dying before their time, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1314.6799999999998s)]
*  like I used to look after, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1317.4399999999998s)]
*  of cancer or chronic neurological illness. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  You know what the top regret of dying people was? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1322.0s)]
*  That they didn't have the courage to be themselves. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1324.3999999999999s)]
*  And the third top regret was [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1327.6399999999999s)]
*  that they didn't have the courage to express their emotions. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1330.6s)]
*  They pretended to be happy when they were not, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  and so on. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1336.56s)]
*  So the question for the rest of us is, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1337.3999999999999s)]
*  do we wanna wait [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1340.56s)]
*  till some terminal illness wakes us up? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1342.72s)]
*  Or should we just confront the fact [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1345.32s)]
*  that in so many ways, we're afraid to be authentic, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1348.0s)]
*  because we're so afraid of being rejected. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1350.72s)]
*  And as children, we didn't have much choice. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1352.76s)]
*  As adults, can we develop that freedom to be ourselves? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1357.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1361.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1363.32s)]
*  yeah, it's amazing [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1365.8799999999999s)]
*  what your feelings or your heart or your mind [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1369.24s)]
*  will want you to do sometimes, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  when other smoke comes in that feels stronger sometimes, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1374.64s)]
*  and it almost clouds that feeling away. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1379.72s)]
*  Yeah, well it does. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1384.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1385.88s)]
*  And am I interrupting, sorry? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1386.72s)]
*  No, I just wanted to, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1388.8000000000002s)]
*  you said in the book that if you have a trauma [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1390.96s)]
*  that you can't process, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1393.48s)]
*  you essentially have the trauma of unprocessed trauma. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1394.44s)]
*  So now you've had a trauma that's happened, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1398.2800000000002s)]
*  and then if you can't process it, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1401.0400000000002s)]
*  now you have almost a new trauma of unprocessed trauma. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1402.4s)]
*  Well, they have the ongoing wound, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1408.8400000000001s)]
*  which is what trauma means. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  Now look, let's take an extreme example. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1414.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1417.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's say a child is being sexually abused. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1418.68s)]
*  So what would their instincts tell them to do? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1422.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, their instincts would say, fight back, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1426.52s)]
*  or run away, or ask for help for God's sakes. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1430.16s)]
*  But by definition, none of those options [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1436.0400000000002s)]
*  are available to the child. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1438.92s)]
*  So the only way they can survive [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1440.68s)]
*  is to disconnect from themselves. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1442.96s)]
*  And that disconnection then gets wired [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1445.96s)]
*  into the nervous system, into the brain. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1447.92s)]
*  And every time they even think of being themselves, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1450.8400000000001s)]
*  as you just described, they get scared. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1454.92s)]
*  Because being themselves, because had they fought back, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1458.3600000000001s)]
*  had they tried to escape, it would have been worse for them. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1462.6000000000001s)]
*  So that disconnection from the self [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1466.44s)]
*  was the only way they survived. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1468.52s)]
*  Now every time as an adult, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1470.3600000000001s)]
*  they even think of being authentic, that fear comes up. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1472.48s)]
*  And it may not even come up for them [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1478.5600000000002s)]
*  in their awake mind. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1480.6000000000001s)]
*  It's almost like it comes up at a level [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1483.16s)]
*  where you don't even realize [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1484.96s)]
*  that something's pulling the strings in the distance. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1488.64s)]
*  That's what's pretty remarkable. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1491.24s)]
*  Well, pulling the strings is exactly the right analogy. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1492.48s)]
*  There's a neurobiologist, neuroscientist, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1496.1200000000001s)]
*  quite well known at Stanford University, Robert Sapolsky, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1498.3600000000001s)]
*  who wrote a book recently called Determined, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1502.08s)]
*  by which he means predetermined. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1504.32s)]
*  He basically says, there's no such thing as free will, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1506.04s)]
*  because we're so conditioned by our biology, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1508.88s)]
*  our culture and our early experiences. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1512.12s)]
*  And he's almost right, because what he's talking about is, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1515.4399999999998s)]
*  as you say, we're pulled by these invisible strings [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1519.6399999999999s)]
*  of our unconscious that were programmed into us [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1522.52s)]
*  even before we were born, even in our mother's wombs. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1525.36s)]
*  And so it's just a life, I find it personally, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1528.52s)]
*  a lifetime's challenge to cut the strings [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1533.04s)]
*  and to actually be in the present moment [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1539.36s)]
*  as an adult person connected to myself. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1541.48s)]
*  Let me tell you, it's a life-long's work. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1544.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1546.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, I feel you, it's funny. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1547.64s)]
*  I didn't even know that I... [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1550.6s)]
*  I didn't know that, I sound crazy, I didn't even... [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1554.1200000000001s)]
*  I existed and everything was fine in my life, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1557.96s)]
*  but I was having trouble building relationships. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1560.56s)]
*  There were just things that I didn't have any real tools [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1563.4s)]
*  to make my life evolve. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1566.2s)]
*  And so I started to think, well, what is going on here? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1569.2s)]
*  And then with a lot of therapy and different modalities [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1571.68s)]
*  of therapy, I went more into my past [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1575.24s)]
*  and I started to see, oh, I see. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1577.5600000000002s)]
*  It's because of these things that have happened [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1580.52s)]
*  and then I never processed them [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1583.28s)]
*  that some of them are still pulling me back, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1585.6000000000001s)]
*  some of them are still holding me. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1589.1200000000001s)]
*  And until you did process them, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1591.52s)]
*  what freedom did you actually have? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1593.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1595.4s)]
*  You'd be like puppets on a string. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1596.24s)]
*  Oh, and yeah, and I was almost a figment of... [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1598.12s)]
*  It's funny people say a figment of your imagination. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  That's almost what I was sometimes. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1604.84s)]
*  I felt like I was something that my mind or that my soul [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1606.52s)]
*  or whatever I had created to best face. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1610.56s)]
*  Persona. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1613.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1614.28s)]
*  Did you ever read Pinocchio as a kid? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1615.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, Geppetto, dude. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1617.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1618.84s)]
*  Now do you remember when Pinocchio becomes a real boy [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1619.6799999999998s)]
*  and he looks at his puppet stuff and he says, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1624.12s)]
*  I was so foolish when I was a puppet. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1626.64s)]
*  But we're also foolish when we're puppets. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1629.8000000000002s)]
*  We're not stupid, but we're unaware. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1631.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1635.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, unaware. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1636.92s)]
*  Man, I've been taking this all weekend [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1638.8000000000002s)]

*  I get dehydrated. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1645.2800000000002s)]

*  So what was the trauma in your life [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1788.12s)]
*  that started you on this journey? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1789.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, what started me on the journey [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1793.56s)]
*  was well into adulthood. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1798.32s)]
*  For a long time, I didn't realize I was traumatized, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1801.08s)]
*  just like you didn't. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1803.36s)]
*  I just was a puppet on a string in some ways, you know? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1804.1999999999998s)]
*  And I was successful. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1807.4799999999998s)]
*  I was a well-respected family doctor, but I was unhappy. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1809.08s)]
*  I felt I had potential that I hadn't even nearly touched, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1814.4399999999998s)]
*  and I had no idea how to get there. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1817.52s)]
*  My marriage had difficulties, a lot of tension. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  My children were facing their challenges, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1826.12s)]
*  and in some ways, they were even afraid of me. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1830.12s)]
*  Like afraid of your energy? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1838.12s)]
*  Afraid of my sudden outbursts of uncontrolled, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1840.12s)]
*  I don't mean physical violence, I mean just outbursts of rage. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1843.9599999999998s)]
*  Anger, yeah, I can relate to that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  And my son Daniel, who helped me write The Myth of Normal, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1852.68s)]
*  he says in the book that the floor was never the floor. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1857.72s)]
*  He never knew when the floor might disappear. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1863.5600000000002s)]
*  In other words, when the loving and devoted and playful parents [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  might all of a sudden erupt in one of their dramas, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1871.0800000000002s)]
*  and the kids are there watching this hurricane sweep [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1875.3200000000002s)]
*  through the house, emotionally speaking, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1881.64s)]
*  well, that doesn't create a basis of trust or security. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1884.0400000000002s)]
*  And it's not because we didn't love our kids. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1887.64s)]
*  It's not because we didn't do our best. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1890.24s)]
*  So looking at it all that, at some point, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1892.3600000000001s)]
*  I had to start asking, like you had to start asking, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1896.76s)]
*  well, what's going on here? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1898.96s)]
*  And that's when I started looking at what happened to me [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  as a kid. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  What were you like as a kid? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1904.0800000000002s)]
*  What was I like? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1905.76s)]
*  I was very smart. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1908.0s)]
*  I've heard you refer to yourself as a smart child. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1910.04s)]
*  You like to rebel. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1912.52s)]
*  I was a rebel, yeah, in communist Hungary. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1914.08s)]
*  You really have to follow the rules. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1918.9599999999998s)]
*  And the teacher at some point sent a warning to my parents [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1920.36s)]
*  saying that he better watch it because he [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1923.6799999999998s)]
*  agitates his classmates. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1925.6s)]
*  I loved getting those. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1928.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, I was very thoughtful. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1929.9599999999998s)]
*  I wet my bed till I was 13. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1936.9599999999998s)]
*  Dude, I wet my bed, I think, till I was 26. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1939.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1941.92s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1942.72s)]
*  And that does go back to childhood trauma, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1943.3200000000002s)]
*  early childhood trauma. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1945.24s)]
*  When I was eight-year-old, my mother took me to a psychologist. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1947.0400000000002s)]
*  And psychologist took my history, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1951.96s)]
*  you know, Jewish infant born under the Nazis, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1955.92s)]
*  or living my first year under the Nazi occupation, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1959.6000000000001s)]
*  and all the horrors, and then the separation [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1962.3600000000001s)]
*  from my mother for six weeks. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
*  And he said to my mom, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1967.68s)]
*  madam, if the only problem this kid has is that he wets his bed, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1970.4s)]
*  you're very fortunate. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1973.48s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, that's not the only problem that I had. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1974.64s)]
*  So on the one hand, I was highly functioning. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1977.2800000000002s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1979.5200000000002s)]
*  And but on the other hand, I had all this unseen stuff [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1982.16s)]
*  that erupted later on. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1988.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1991.48s)]
*  You don't even know it's there, especially when you're a kid. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1992.0s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1993.76s)]
*  No, you don't know. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1994.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you don't know. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1995.4s)]
*  You don't know that it's there. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1996.5200000000002s)]
*  And then later you have to... [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=1997.48s)]
*  It's almost like a fire that starts when you're young, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2000.4s)]
*  but the smoke doesn't show up. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2004.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2007.24s)]
*  For me, it wasn't until my 30s. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2007.56s)]
*  And I was like, where the f... [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2008.96s)]
*  Is all this smoke coming from? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2010.08s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2012.08s)]
*  That's what happened to me. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2012.8s)]
*  And then I had to go back and look at it. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2013.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, yeah, unprocessed trauma. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2015.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's like a fire. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2017.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, imagine starting a fire, but no smoke comes out of it. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2018.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2021.6s)]
*  That's unprocessed trauma. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2021.96s)]
*  Well, the... [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2023.2s)]
*  Does that make sense or it doesn't? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2024.76s)]
*  No, it makes total sense because what happens is, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2026.0s)]
*  like when you said earlier, you were fine. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2028.8s)]
*  The heck you were fine. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2030.72s)]
*  You thought you were fine. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2032.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2033.28s)]
*  And that's because we pushed down all the rage [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2033.6s)]
*  that we never expressed as kids. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2038.2s)]
*  We pushed down the pain. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2039.72s)]
*  We pushed down the isolation. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2041.92s)]
*  We pretend. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2045.28s)]
*  And we can function in the world in ways [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2046.6s)]
*  that the world can even respect and reward at this. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2049.92s)]
*  I mean, look at, we're talking here in Hollywood. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2053.2s)]
*  Look at all the figures here that were great successes, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2055.88s)]
*  idols to millions, and they had these miserable inner lives. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2060.04s)]
*  I mean, you can list 100 of them. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2063.56s)]
*  Yeah, I got 50 of them in my phone. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2067.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2069.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2069.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2070.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's... [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2070.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's... [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2072.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny that if things... [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2073.32s)]
*  If it's not... [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2074.56s)]
*  The foundation isn't there, then you'll go find it in the world. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2075.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2078.84s)]
*  And sometimes what you go find, even though you're just trying [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  to replicate what you didn't get when you were young, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2084.64s)]
*  it can be detrimental to you. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2088.6s)]
*  Which is why people get into unhealthy relationships, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2091.24s)]
*  because where did we most want love when we were kids? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2095.56s)]
*  When we most wanted to be seen? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2100.2s)]
*  By whom? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2102.08s)]
*  By the people that couldn't do it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2103.24s)]
*  Therefore, we will repeatedly look for people who can't see us [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2105.3599999999997s)]
*  and hoping that this time they will. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2110.3199999999997s)]
*  They will. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2111.92s)]
*  You know? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2112.56s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2113.96s)]
*  I have this thing that came into my head. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2114.72s)]
*  I could jump off of a cliff, right? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2119.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2121.3199999999997s)]
*  But if I heard a mom come home from work back on the top of that cliff, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2121.84s)]
*  I would find a way to get... [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2129.16s)]
*  Or if I heard high heels, if I heard a woman's footsteps, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2130.4s)]
*  I'd find a way to get back up there and look towards her. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2133.36s)]
*  Because you're looking for the mom. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2136.48s)]
*  Because I'm just... [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2137.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's like... [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2138.24s)]
*  It may sound crazy, but... [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2139.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if... [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2141.96s)]
*  I can't help but look. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2145.0s)]
*  I can't help but wonder, is that woman accept me? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2147.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2151.3199999999997s)]
*  Even with dating and all my relationships, I see it now. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2151.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like, you know, I'm always kind of... [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2154.04s)]
*  Even in just any relationship, or any moment, I'm just looking, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2157.68s)]
*  do you accept me? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2162.08s)]
*  I can feel this, do you accept me? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2163.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2165.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, it really gets in the way of male-female relationships. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2166.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2175.76s)]
*  Because a lot of us, I mean, myself included, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2176.6s)]
*  in my relationship with my spouse, in some ways, I just wanted to be mothered. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2181.76s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2186.04s)]
*  Not just loved as an adult, but actually mothered. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2186.64s)]
*  On the one hand, on the other hand, I would resent it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2190.8s)]
*  Because I don't want to be controlled. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2195.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2197.28s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2197.8s)]
*  So it puts the woman into an impossible situation. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2198.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2202.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I would never date me. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2203.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2205.32s)]
*  Oh, jeepers. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2205.84s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2206.76s)]
*  Even now? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2207.96s)]
*  It's getting better, but it's still... [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2208.92s)]
*  It's getting better. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2211.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2213.32s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2213.76s)]
*  Yeah, those relationships are tough. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2214.32s)]
*  You know, I have trouble committing in a relationship. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2215.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, I did some ayahuasca ceremonies. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2218.6800000000003s)]
*  People do plant medicine. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2221.92s)]
*  Well, hey, you haven't read the chapter, Yaron Ayahuasca. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2223.6s)]
*  There's one in here? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2226.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2227.48s)]
*  Fuck yeah, dude. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2228.48s)]
*  Chapter... [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2229.48s)]
*  I think it's chapter 31. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2230.68s)]
*  So you had experience with it? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2231.84s)]
*  I used to lead the retweets with it. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2233.36s)]
*  No way, bro. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2234.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2236.16s)]
*  And... [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2236.88s)]
*  Dude, that's amazing, dude. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2238.96s)]
*  What were you going to say about it? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2240.7999999999997s)]
*  I was going to say that when I did a plant medicine retreat, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2241.92s)]
*  that I realized one of the reasons why I've had trouble getting relationships [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2246.16s)]
*  is because I'm still waiting for this original relationship. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2249.8s)]
*  The perfect mom. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2253.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's no blame. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2254.88s)]
*  It's not a blame on my mom. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2255.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't do that anymore. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2256.6800000000003s)]
*  I lament some of the feelings from my youth, but I don't... [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2259.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, I love my mother, and I'm grateful that she did the best that she could, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2264.6000000000004s)]
*  and I believe that she did. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2268.44s)]
*  But yeah, I realize, like, I can't... [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2271.0400000000004s)]
*  There's just a part of me that's just still... [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2274.1600000000003s)]
*  I feel like it's like a kid standing on a dock, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2278.44s)]
*  like, waiting for a boat to come. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2280.8s)]
*  That's how I envision it a lot of times. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2282.36s)]
*  But so there's a deep longing. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2286.0s)]
*  I totally understand that. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2286.84s)]
*  And then you try to get someone else to fill it, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2288.36s)]
*  and they don't even know what to do. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2290.12s)]
*  And for years, I didn't even know I was trying to get somebody to fill it. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just nothing... I couldn't figure it out. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  There was that emptiness. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2297.28s)]
*  Oh, it was wild, man. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2298.32s)]
*  And my life was still okay, but just below, right below the surface level of my life, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2300.1600000000003s)]
*  there was... it was a precarious foundation. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2304.96s)]
*  I totally understand. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2308.7200000000003s)]
*  I found out about ayahuasca after my book on addiction got published in 2009. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2311.04s)]
*  It's called In the Realm of Hunger Ghost, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2318.44s)]
*  and it's about how addiction is not a genetic disease, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2320.16s)]
*  it's a response to trauma as it affects the brain and the psyche. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2323.2400000000002s)]
*  But after I published that book, I go on book tour, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2328.6800000000003s)]
*  and people got asking me, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2332.84s)]
*  what do you know about addiction and its healing with ayahuasca? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2334.0s)]
*  I said, I know nothing about it. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2337.7200000000003s)]
*  Next visit, next stop. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2339.28s)]
*  What do you know about it? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2342.1200000000003s)]
*  I said, leave me alone already. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2343.44s)]
*  I mean, I just spent three years writing the book, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2345.44s)]
*  and you're asking me about the one thing I don't know anything about. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2347.6400000000003s)]
*  And then finally somebody said, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2350.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, you could experience this up here in Vancouver, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2352.84s)]
*  because the Peruvian shaman who came up there. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2355.48s)]
*  So I did the ayahuasca, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2358.44s)]
*  and I experienced pure love for the first time in my life. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2361.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a little baby in the tent whose father had done a plant, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2365.56s)]
*  and the mother was there with the baby, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2369.4399999999996s)]
*  and the baby started cooing and wooing and owing, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2371.16s)]
*  and these tears of love just flowed down my face. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2377.4399999999996s)]
*  My heart just opened, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2377.9599999999996s)]
*  and I realized how close my heart had been, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2380.9199999999996s)]
*  because it was so bruised so early that I closed it down. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2384.12s)]
*  Not that I deliberately closed it down, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2388.64s)]
*  but as a way of protecting it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2390.2799999999997s)]
*  And that... [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2394.2s)]
*  That must have been my dinner. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2398.2s)]
*  I can work with this to help people who are addicted. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2399.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, I'm not here to advocate its use. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2401.92s)]
*  It's not for everybody. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2406.64s)]
*  It's certainly not a panacea. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2408.16s)]
*  You know, psychedelics is a whole other conversation. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2410.64s)]
*  Yeah, same. I'm not saying anybody should... [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2414.2799999999997s)]
*  They have their place. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2416.36s)]
*  They're not the answer, and they're certainly not for everybody, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2419.48s)]
*  but in the right context, with the right guidance, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2423.44s)]
*  the right preparation, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2427.6000000000004s)]
*  they can really help people open up to parts of themselves [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2429.96s)]
*  that they weren't even aware that they were there. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2433.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2435.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2436.88s)]
*  I mean, it's fascinating, and I hope that that... [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2437.84s)]
*  The knowledge of that evolves over time, you know? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2440.1200000000003s)]
*  But that can also be scary, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2443.32s)]
*  because some people go and get addicted to that. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2444.4s)]
*  I've seen that happen with people. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2446.28s)]
*  I've seen it too, because what people get addicted to [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2447.76s)]
*  is not so much the substances, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2449.76s)]
*  because nobody's going to get addicted to it. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2451.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's nasty. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2453.7200000000003s)]
*  You can't just have some at a club. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2454.7200000000003s)]
*  But what they get addicted to is the heightened experience. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2457.44s)]
*  And if they don't know how to integrate [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2462.28s)]
*  what they've learned into their lives, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2463.8s)]
*  then they keep looking for that elevated experience [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2465.6400000000003s)]
*  that takes them out of their ordinary self. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2470.76s)]
*  And so I really think that that's one of the risks [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2473.2s)]
*  of psychedelic use, is that you start looking for that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2476.6s)]
*  elevated, heightened, or deepened experience [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2482.52s)]
*  that's missing from your life, where the whole thing is... [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2485.3599999999997s)]
*  The experience can open the door, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2491.04s)]
*  but you've got to walk through it. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2493.2s)]
*  And you have to keep walking through it, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2494.7599999999998s)]
*  not when you're under the influence of the medicine. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2496.3199999999997s)]
*  Right, the integration. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2498.2799999999997s)]
*  The integration, yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2499.3999999999996s)]
*  It's so key. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2500.24s)]
*  Yeah, we've lost... [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2501.48s)]
*  That's a huge part of our society. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2502.32s)]
*  That's kind of... [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2503.6s)]
*  Now we just kind of get a piece of information, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2504.76s)]
*  and then we're like, oh, we have the information, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2506.88s)]
*  but we don't take as much time [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2508.64s)]
*  to integrate something into our life. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2510.64s)]
*  That's one thing I've noticed for myself anyway. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2514.76s)]
*  I don't want to pin that on everybody, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2516.48s)]
*  but I'll notice that sometimes I'll learn something, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2517.6s)]
*  I'll learn a fact, or I'll learn a way that I've... [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2519.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, I know this about me now, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2523.6s)]
*  or this is something I've learned. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2525.12s)]
*  But unless I integrate the solution of that, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2526.7200000000003s)]
*  or the information from that, the positive information, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2530.2s)]
*  instead of just shouting it out that I know it, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2534.92s)]
*  actually integrating it and taking time to integrate it. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2537.7999999999997s)]
*  Even taking time, like if you go to a church sermon, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2540.7999999999997s)]
*  or a mosque sermon, or... [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2543.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, synagogue. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2548.96s)]
*  Synagogue sermon, yeah, Jewish church, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2549.7999999999997s)]
*  I was gonna say synagogue sermon. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2551.16s)]
*  But, and you can hear a message, right? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2552.64s)]
*  But then you can just go on about your day. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2554.8799999999997s)]
*  But taking time to integrate a message in your life, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2556.16s)]
*  what did I hear, how does it make me feel? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2561.2799999999997s)]
*  What do I think about it? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2562.12s)]
*  I think we used to have a lot more time to do that [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2563.12s)]
*  just because our society wasn't so, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2565.3599999999997s)]
*  our lives weren't so frenetic. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2568.04s)]
*  Well, I think we're addicted, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2569.7599999999998s)]
*  particularly I think the United States is addicted [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2572.6s)]
*  to the quick fix. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2575.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2576.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2577.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that Earl Shieb. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2578.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2579.56s)]
*  The spray paint it. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2580.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2582.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2583.3199999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2584.16s)]
*  Have you struggled with addiction before? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2585.12s)]
*  Have I struggled with addiction? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2587.3599999999997s)]
*  I know you struggled with work addiction [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2588.2s)]
*  I think you talked about. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2589.48s)]
*  I've had two major addictions. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2591.16s)]
*  One is workaholism. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2594.9199999999996s)]
*  And again, I have to make a distinction here. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2597.24s)]
*  I mean, I did good work and I did work that had meaning [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2602.4399999999996s)]
*  and made a contribution. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2606.68s)]
*  That's good. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2609.68s)]
*  That's the calling. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2611.7599999999998s)]
*  But then there's another part of it which is being driven. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2613.52s)]
*  I mean, you're being driven, you're not in charge. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2616.68s)]
*  You're like a leaf being driven by the wind. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2618.6s)]
*  And I was driven to work [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2620.68s)]
*  because I have to keep proving my importance [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2622.12s)]
*  and that the people should like me, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2624.6s)]
*  people should respect me. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2626.2s)]
*  And why? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2627.8399999999997s)]
*  Because I didn't respect myself. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2628.7999999999997s)]
*  And because I got this message early in life [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2630.72s)]
*  that I just wasn't important, you know? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2633.72s)]
*  And I believe that the trauma is not, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2636.2799999999997s)]
*  for example, the trauma is not, for example, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2639.16s)]
*  that my mother gave me to a stranger [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2641.2s)]
*  when I was 11 months old to save my life. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2643.6s)]
*  That wasn't the trauma. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2646.16s)]
*  That was the traumatic event. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2647.44s)]
*  Trauma is what happens inside you. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2649.12s)]
*  The trauma inside me was that I concluded from that [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2651.3199999999997s)]
*  that I wasn't lovable, I wasn't important. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2654.72s)]
*  Now, that drives the work addiction [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2657.16s)]
*  because you have to keep proving to yourself. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2659.52s)]
*  The other addiction I had, and people often laugh, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2661.4s)]
*  and Harkin called that an addiction, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2664.7599999999998s)]
*  but really it was shopping for classical compact discs. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2666.16s)]
*  CDs? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2670.8399999999997s)]
*  CDs. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2671.68s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2672.52s)]
*  I would drop three, $4,000 a day on them. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2673.36s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2676.8s)]
*  You can't even smoke them. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2677.6400000000003s)]
*  No, you can't smoke them. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2679.1600000000003s)]
*  And no sooner would I leave the store, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2681.6400000000003s)]
*  but I'd have to run back to get some more. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2684.36s)]
*  So it wasn't about having and enjoying. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2686.08s)]
*  I love the music, but it wasn't about that. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2688.1200000000003s)]
*  It was about getting more and more and more [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2690.44s)]
*  and never enough. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2692.1200000000003s)]
*  And so I would lie to my wife about it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2693.6s)]
*  I would sometimes neglect my work. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2696.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I mentioned this in this book, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2698.28s)]
*  but in my book of addiction, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2701.52s)]
*  I talk about how I left a woman in labor once [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2704.12s)]
*  to go get a compact disc. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2706.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2707.2s)]
*  What album was it? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2708.04s)]
*  That I don't remember anymore. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2708.8799999999997s)]
*  I think it was a Mozart symphony, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2711.52s)]
*  but I don't remember anymore. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2713.4799999999996s)]
*  So I'm talking about, I'm not talking about my passion [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2715.0s)]
*  for music. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2718.68s)]
*  I'm talking about my drivenness. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2720.12s)]
*  And sometimes people say, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2721.9599999999996s)]
*  well, how can you compare your addictions [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2723.56s)]
*  to your heroin addicted, cocaine addicted, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2725.2s)]
*  HIV written clients? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2728.2s)]
*  And I said, I don't. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2731.3599999999997s)]
*  The differences are obvious. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2733.6s)]
*  It's the similarities that are interesting. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2734.52s)]
*  And when I told my patients in the downtown Eastside [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2737.08s)]
*  who were using the heroin and the cocaine and whatever, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2740.04s)]
*  but I've got these- [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2745.36s)]
*  These boys to men albums, yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2747.0s)]
*  And they said, they never said, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2748.7200000000003s)]
*  how can you compare? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2751.64s)]
*  You know what they said? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2752.48s)]
*  Hey, doc, you just like the rest of us, aren't you? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2753.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2756.04s)]
*  And my point is, we are all just like the rest of us. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2756.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2761.52s)]
*  We all find some chronic escape. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2762.36s)]
*  Not all of us. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2764.92s)]
*  Most people, whether it's drugs, pornography, sex, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2765.88s)]
*  internet, cell phones. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2769.28s)]
*  Gambling, there's so many. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2770.4s)]
*  Gambling, self-cutting, eating, shopping. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2771.7200000000003s)]
*  Running, working out. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2775.76s)]
*  That's a huge one. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2777.1600000000003s)]
*  Extreme working out and all that. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2778.08s)]
*  And we're running away from ourselves. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2779.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  And so, and when I ask people, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2783.56s)]
*  not what's wrong with your addiction, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2786.44s)]
*  because that's obvious, but what's right about it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2788.4s)]
*  Like for example, I mean, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2791.44s)]
*  you've had alcohol and drug issues. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2792.28s)]
*  I've heard you say. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2794.04s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2795.12s)]
*  What did they do for you in the short term? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2795.96s)]
*  I think it just, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2798.8s)]
*  it gave me a break from how I wanted to feel. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2801.8s)]
*  It gave me a break from me. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2806.12s)]
*  It gave you a break from how you felt. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2807.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2809.76s)]
*  It gave me a break from my feelings. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2810.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2812.28s)]
*  And it just gave me a break from me. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2813.12s)]
*  I was just- [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2814.4s)]
*  But that's because you were really [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2815.4s)]
*  uncomfortable with yourself. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2816.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2817.2400000000002s)]
*  And because you had feelings that were painful. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2818.08s)]
*  So my mantra on addiction, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2819.96s)]
*  which I mentioned in this book, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2822.7200000000003s)]
*  is don't ask why the addiction, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2824.28s)]
*  ask why the pain. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2825.7200000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2826.8s)]
*  And if you understand why people have pain, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2827.6800000000003s)]
*  don't look at their genes. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2830.6800000000003s)]
*  Look at their lives. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2832.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2834.04s)]
*  What happened to them? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2834.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2835.92s)]
*  Yeah, you say, or I've heard you, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2837.08s)]
*  in your book you talk about addiction. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2839.32s)]
*  If you recognize the harm it's, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2841.2000000000003s)]
*  or I think it might've been in an interview you did, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2843.04s)]
*  if you recognize the harm it's doing [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2845.92s)]
*  and you keep doing it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2848.08s)]
*  Yeah, so addiction is manifested in any behavior [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2849.92s)]
*  in which a person finds temporary relief or pleasure [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2854.2s)]
*  and therefore craves, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2858.56s)]
*  but then suffers negative consequences [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2860.2s)]
*  and they don't give it up. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2862.88s)]
*  So pleasure, craving, relief in the short term, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2864.6s)]
*  harm in the long term, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2867.2s)]
*  refusal and inability to let go of it, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2868.72s)]
*  that's what an addiction is. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2870.96s)]
*  So it's got nothing to do with drugs. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2872.48s)]
*  Well, it could have to do with drugs. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2874.52s)]
*  Could have to do with any of the things [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2876.12s)]
*  we already mentioned. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2877.12s)]
*  But why the pain, that's the question. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2878.84s)]
*  The question is why the pain. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2880.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2881.88s)]
*  Where are we running away from? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2882.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2883.76s)]
*  Yeah, I had, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2885.08s)]
*  like once I saw like pornography and stuff like that, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2887.36s)]
*  it was like, and I could do masturbation or jerk and all [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2891.56s)]
*  for whatever people call it, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2895.2s)]
*  but once I, that was the first way that I realized, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2896.28s)]
*  oh, I can make myself feel good. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2901.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2902.92s)]
*  And it was like the first time that I like, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2903.76s)]
*  yeah, I could make myself feel good. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2907.08s)]
*  And so then it just became, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2908.8s)]
*  yeah, it became a way that I always, I mean, I would just, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2911.84s)]
*  but yeah, I would just, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2917.0s)]
*  the only way I knew how to make myself really feel good, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2918.56s)]
*  even though it was just for a moment, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2921.0s)]
*  but I would take it. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2922.72s)]
*  Shall I tell you something scientific about that? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2924.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2926.48s)]
*  So cocaine addicts and crystal meth addicts, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2927.32s)]
*  or any stimulant addicts, in fact, all addicts, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2930.84s)]
*  amongst the things they're looking for, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2934.4s)]
*  is ahead of dopamine. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  Dopamine is the incentive, motivation, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2937.72s)]
*  chemical in our brain. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2940.96s)]
*  It's what makes us feel vital and alive and, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2942.04s)]
*  you know, ready to go. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2944.9199999999996s)]
*  And without it, we can't survive. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2947.16s)]
*  Now, cocaine, crystal meth. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2949.12s)]
*  Without it, we can't survive. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2951.56s)]
*  No, we can't. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2952.68s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2953.52s)]
*  That's cool to hear. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2954.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2955.2s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2956.04s)]
*  Oh no, because dopamine flows in the brain [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2956.8799999999997s)]
*  when we're exploring a novel object or a novel environment, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2960.12s)]
*  when we're seeking food, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2965.08s)]
*  when we're seeking a sexual partner. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2966.2s)]
*  We can't survive without that stuff. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2968.32s)]
*  You can take a mouse in a laboratory [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2970.12s)]
*  and put food in front of him and he's hungry, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2973.8s)]
*  but he won't eat. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2977.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2978.52s)]
*  Because genetically, you knocked out his dopamine receptors [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2979.36s)]
*  and he doesn't have the motivation. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2981.88s)]
*  So it's the motivation chemical. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2984.12s)]
*  It's absolutely essential. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2985.6s)]
*  No, cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, crystal meth, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2986.84s)]
*  they literally give you a direct hit of dopamine. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2991.48s)]
*  So does pornography. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2994.64s)]
*  When you do a brain scan on some people, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2996.44s)]
*  they get repeated spikes of dopamine. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=2997.8799999999997s)]
*  It's not the pornography they're addicted to. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3000.48s)]
*  It's that hit of dopamine that they get in their brains. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3002.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3005.92s)]
*  And all addictions, shopping, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3007.12s)]
*  I mean, when I went to the record store, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3010.12s)]
*  it was the dopamine. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3012.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I've been diagnosed with ADHD. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3013.44s)]
*  The first book I wrote was on ADD. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3015.4s)]
*  And spacing out, absent-mindedness, all this kind of stuff. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3018.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, daydreaming, they used to call it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3025.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3027.16s)]
*  But when I was in the record store, I was present. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3029.56s)]
*  I was focused. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3033.48s)]
*  I could almost remember which records I bought [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3035.2799999999997s)]
*  at which store at what time. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3038.7999999999997s)]
*  Because the dopamine was flowing like crazy [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3040.52s)]
*  and that's why I needed to go back. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3044.0s)]
*  It wasn't because I needed more music. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3046.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the trunk's full. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3048.0s)]
*  I was after that. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3049.6000000000004s)]
*  I was hiding the discs on the porch and in the attic [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3051.0400000000004s)]
*  so my wife wouldn't call me. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3053.96s)]
*  You know, but I was after that. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3055.36s)]
*  The ceiling caves in, it's just a bunch of Van Halen. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3057.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3060.0400000000004s)]
*  And I was after that dopamine. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3061.48s)]
*  Dopamine, wow. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3062.96s)]
*  You know, which is what you're after with the pornography. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3064.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it just was, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3067.0400000000004s)]
*  and it was a way to make me feel good [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3068.92s)]
*  and it was the first way that I could interact [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3070.28s)]
*  with a woman where it felt like I could, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3071.6000000000004s)]
*  and I know it's not real interaction, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3073.88s)]
*  but it was like this is the safest, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3075.92s)]
*  closest I can get to interacting with a woman [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3077.88s)]
*  and it being like okay, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3080.96s)]
*  because I would get so nervous around women [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3082.76s)]
*  or like if women looked at me, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3084.84s)]
*  I would like, my whole body, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3086.08s)]
*  like I just, I couldn't handle it. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3088.12s)]
*  But yeah, that dopamine is, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3091.56s)]
*  it's interesting to hear. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3093.44s)]
*  So yeah, no matter what it is, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3094.28s)]
*  it's the dopamine behind it. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3096.08s)]
*  It's the dopamine. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3097.96s)]
*  No, and there's another chemical [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3098.96s)]
*  that's involved in many addictions. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3102.32s)]
*  Like the heroin addicts or the opiate addicts, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3105.4s)]
*  the fentanyl addicts, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3107.56s)]
*  those are opiates, which come from the opium plant. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3109.52s)]
*  But why do they work in the human brain? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3113.2400000000002s)]
*  Why would an opium plant work in the human brain? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3115.52s)]
*  Because we have receptors for them. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3117.88s)]
*  We have molecules that receives the opiate molecule. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3119.7200000000003s)]
*  Now why do we have receptors [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3123.0s)]
*  from a plant that grows in Afghanistan? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3124.84s)]
*  We don't. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3127.0s)]
*  We have receptors for our own internal opiates. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3128.0s)]
*  So we have an internal opiate system [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3132.08s)]
*  and they are called endorphins. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3134.52s)]
*  Endorphin means endogenous internal opiate. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3137.08s)]
*  So those are, our endorphins are our own opiates. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3140.44s)]
*  So we manufacture our own opiates. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3143.12s)]
*  Not only we do, plants do, animals do, everybody. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3145.36s)]
*  Now the question is what do the opiates do [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3148.3199999999997s)]
*  in the human brain? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3150.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, they do a whole lot of things. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3152.2s)]
*  But three, importantly, they relieve pain, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3153.72s)]
*  physical and emotional pain, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3157.7999999999997s)]
*  because pain is necessary for life. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3159.88s)]
*  Otherwise I could smash my hand on this table. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3162.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you jump out of a window and you wouldn't care. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3164.3199999999997s)]
*  But I also have to do some pain relief. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3166.48s)]
*  That's the endorphins, number one. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3168.72s)]
*  Number two, what they do is they give you [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3171.12s)]
*  a sense of pleasure and reward. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3173.16s)]
*  So when people go bungee jumping, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3175.2s)]
*  they get this high level of endorphins. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3179.12s)]
*  That's what they're after. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3181.08s)]
*  Ah, that's why they keep doing wild stuff like that. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3182.3199999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3186.9199999999996s)]
*  And then the third thing is the most important. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3187.7599999999998s)]
*  The endorphins help to make possible [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3190.08s)]
*  this little thing called love. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3192.92s)]
*  And if you knock out the endorphin receptors [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3195.3199999999997s)]
*  of little mice in the laboratory, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3198.68s)]
*  they will not cry for their mothers on separation. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3200.68s)]
*  Now what would that mean in the wild? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3203.84s)]
*  It would mean their death. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3205.7599999999998s)]
*  So endorphins connect people to each other, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3207.44s)]
*  especially parents and children. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3211.16s)]
*  And so we're each other's opiates in a way. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3213.44s)]
*  We're each other's opiates, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3215.4s)]
*  especially in a healthy parent-child relationship. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3216.36s)]
*  And they both have endorphins flowing in their brain [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3221.36s)]
*  when they're looking into each other's eyes. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3223.84s)]
*  And when I ask heroin addicts or opiate addicts, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3226.1600000000003s)]
*  a sex trade worker I asked once, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3233.8s)]
*  what does the heroin do for you? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3235.28s)]
*  She said, when the first time I did heroin, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3236.92s)]
*  it felt like a warm, soft hug. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3238.88s)]
*  What was she talking about? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3241.48s)]
*  Connection. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3242.84s)]
*  Connection, yeah. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3243.6800000000003s)]
*  And in this book, I talk about it, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3244.72s)]
*  and so many of the addicts, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3247.64s)]
*  like a very well-known recovery leader [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3249.8799999999997s)]
*  and a fearless advocate is Jamie Lee Curtis. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3254.0s)]
*  And she told me. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3258.8799999999997s)]
*  Is she? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3260.24s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3261.16s)]
*  She is. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3262.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, she's a big 12-stepper. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3262.8199999999997s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3263.92s)]
*  Oh no, she's a huge 12-stepper. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3264.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3266.4s)]
*  And very forthright about her addictions [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3267.24s)]
*  and also her recovery. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3270.44s)]
*  Wow, that's fascinating. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3272.8399999999997s)]
*  I'd love to talk with her. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3273.68s)]
*  I've seen her eat lunch in the Palisades before, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3275.4s)]
*  Pacific Palisades before. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3276.24s)]
*  But she told me that what the opiates did for her [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3278.08s)]
*  gave her a sense of warmth in the belly. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3281.52s)]
*  That warmth is what we're all after. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3284.08s)]
*  That comes from human connection. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3287.04s)]
*  And when we didn't have the connections [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3289.48s)]
*  we needed early in life, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3290.88s)]
*  then we keep looking for that warmth from other sources. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3292.32s)]
*  So these people that are addicted to opiates, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3295.4s)]
*  that's what they're looking for. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3298.64s)]
*  A bunch of hug hunters. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3301.04s)]
*  I want to go back a little bit to trauma and isolation. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3302.68s)]
*  And I wanted to ask, what is it about not being emotionally, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3306.7599999999998s)]
*  about not being emotionally isolated [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3310.0s)]
*  that allows one to process a trauma? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3312.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3316.04s)]
*  So, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3317.12s)]
*  I did a day-long event here in LA [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3320.2799999999997s)]
*  just a day before we were recording this. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3324.64s)]
*  And I worked with a woman called Kimberly Shannon Murphy, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3327.48s)]
*  who is one of Hollywood's top stunt women. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3331.12s)]
*  She just got a lifetime achievement award. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3334.24s)]
*  Nice, congratulations Kim. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3336.36s)]
*  And she worked with Cameron Diaz and Uma Thurman [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3337.48s)]
*  and Tom Cruise and all these people. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3342.92s)]
*  A lot of hotties. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3344.88s)]
*  No, she was sexually abused by her grandfather. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3345.72s)]
*  All throughout her childhood and adolescence. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3349.24s)]
*  And of course, the family was in denial. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3355.72s)]
*  Nobody noticed it. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3358.96s)]
*  If they noticed it, they kept silent about it. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3360.04s)]
*  She was totally alone with it. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3362.24s)]
*  So, that's what induced the wound. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3364.6s)]
*  And had she been able to talk to somebody and say, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3368.28s)]
*  this is happening to me, please help me, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3371.52s)]
*  she would not have been traumatized. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3373.96s)]
*  So the trauma happens when a child suffers [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3376.36s)]
*  and has nobody to share that suffering with. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3379.96s)]
*  Whether it's the extreme suffering or sexual abuse [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3382.8s)]
*  or the milder, you might say, suffering [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3386.04s)]
*  or just not being seen for who you are. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3387.96s)]
*  If you're alone with it, you can't process it. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3390.4s)]
*  So what happens later on to answer your question, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3393.04s)]
*  when you meet somebody where you feel safe [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3396.4s)]
*  and now you can express what's happening with you, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3400.32s)]
*  that's what helps to process the trauma. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3403.44s)]
*  Got it. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3405.76s)]
*  So it requires compassion and safety. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3406.6s)]
*  And ideally, I mean, I criticize the 12 step groups, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3411.64s)]
*  not for what they do, because I love what they do, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3417.3599999999997s)]
*  for what they don't do. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3419.64s)]
*  I don't think they talk about trauma enough. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3420.48s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3422.44s)]
*  But a 12 step group that's properly run [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3424.2799999999997s)]
*  will offer you support and safety. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3429.2799999999997s)]
*  So now you can share yourself and be seen by others. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3432.3199999999997s)]
*  Amen. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3435.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've gotten even into [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3436.56s)]
*  the intimacy disorder groups, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3438.4s)]
*  and those are a lot more potent [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3439.72s)]
*  with people talking about their emotional disorders [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3443.44s)]
*  and traumas and things that happen. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3449.0s)]
*  And it's not a crybaby group either. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3452.12s)]
*  Sometimes we talk about trauma, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3455.04s)]
*  but I don't talk about it from a crybaby place. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3456.16s)]
*  I like to talk about it from this is important [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3458.52s)]
*  and it's important to learn about, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3461.2400000000002s)]
*  and I like to share what I learn about from it. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3464.84s)]
*  It's not about people victimizing themselves [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3467.6s)]
*  or trying to present themselves as a victim. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3471.16s)]
*  It's saying, this is what happened to me, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3474.1200000000003s)]
*  and it's my responsibility to learn from it. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3475.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3478.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's my responsibility to grow from it, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3478.92s)]
*  not to wallow in all of what happened to me [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3480.7200000000003s)]
*  and I can't help it. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3482.84s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3484.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell you this, Mr. Montay, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3485.0800000000004s)]
*  that a thing I realized I was addicted to a few years ago, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3487.0s)]
*  self-pity, and I didn't even know it. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3491.32s)]
*  I kept always thinking, man, what's wrong with me? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3494.28s)]
*  I have to fix this. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3497.0400000000004s)]
*  Every day, nothing was enough. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3498.5600000000004s)]
*  And then I realized that even though it seemed [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3501.08s)]
*  like I was trying to make myself better, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3504.36s)]
*  the truth was that I was always seeing myself as less than [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3506.4s)]
*  because those things have to both be present [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3512.3199999999997s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3514.08s)]
*  Because I can only get better if, you know, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3516.36s)]
*  I'm never enough. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3518.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, that- [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3521.2s)]
*  If I'm never being enough, though, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3522.04s)]
*  I'm trying to figure this out. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3527.12s)]
*  I got addicted to self-pity. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3528.96s)]
*  I got addicted to like- [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3530.2s)]
*  Can I jump in with a thought? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3531.56s)]
*  Yes, please. Thank you. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3532.56s)]
*  Dear God, please. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3533.56s)]
*  It did something for you. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3534.64s)]
*  It took away responsibility from you. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3536.96s)]
*  Now, human beings have a hard time taking responsibility. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, I have a hard time taking responsibility. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3544.2s)]
*  You know, we all have a hard time taking responsibility. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3547.08s)]
*  So when you're in that self-pity mode, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3550.16s)]
*  you're suffering, but you don't have to take responsibility. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3554.08s)]
*  I'm suggesting that's what it did for you. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3557.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3559.3199999999997s)]
*  yeah, maybe there was a part of me [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3562.08s)]
*  that wanted to keep it around [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3563.9199999999996s)]
*  because it always let there be something wrong with me, too. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3565.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3569.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3570.04s)]
*  Like if I never solve this, if I'm never enough, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3570.8799999999997s)]
*  then there'll always be something wrong with me. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3574.24s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3576.56s)]
*  It makes sense because, again, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3577.8399999999997s)]
*  it takes away the challenge of growth. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3579.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3583.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we talk about growing pains. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3584.6s)]
*  Growth is painful. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3587.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah, people go from damn seven inches to seven beats, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3588.92s)]
*  six and a half, six one or whatever. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3592.32s)]
*  Yeah, and emotional growth is also painful. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3593.88s)]
*  And so when we don't grow, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3599.04s)]
*  at least we avoid the growing pains. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3602.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3604.84s)]
*  Yeah, whenever I used to smoke, I used to be like, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3607.08s)]
*  part of me didn't want to quit smoking [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3610.56s)]
*  because I wanted to have an excuse for why I wasn't, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3612.76s)]
*  why I wasn't doing other things. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3615.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3617.9599999999996s)]
*  That makes sense? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  It makes total sense. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3619.64s)]
*  Little sense is enough. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3620.48s)]
*  I'll take it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3621.64s)]
*  Does blue chew work? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3624.0s)]

*  Well, tell me about it. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3792.56s)]
*  I just felt ashamed of myself. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3793.6800000000003s)]
*  I felt ashamed of like, yeah, I felt ashamed of how I looked. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3795.64s)]
*  I felt ashamed of like my ears, my nose, my face, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3800.0s)]
*  my, the way I stood. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3803.92s)]
*  I felt, yeah, I felt ashamed of my family, of my home. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3806.64s)]
*  Just everything, I just felt a ton of it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3813.88s)]
*  I'm not whining about it right now, I'm just thinking back. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3817.32s)]
*  But yeah, I just felt a ton of shame. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3819.4s)]
*  I felt like, I felt like, I think I felt ashamed [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3821.6800000000003s)]
*  of who I was at like the first molecule almost, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3827.1600000000003s)]
*  like the first cell of my, the dirt under the roots. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3829.88s)]
*  It felt like I just, there was a part of me [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3834.6400000000003s)]
*  that felt like I was, me or anything that had to do [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3836.96s)]
*  with me was gross. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3839.92s)]
*  I understand. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3841.52s)]
*  And I use the word gross, because it felt like gross. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3842.6000000000004s)]
*  Now the only thing I'll say is, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3846.28s)]
*  it's not that you felt you were gross, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3855.32s)]
*  it's you believed you were. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3857.28s)]
*  Right, yes, yeah, you're right. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3859.0800000000004s)]
*  I didn't feel it, it wasn't like a feeling [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3860.88s)]
*  on the surface of me. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3863.1200000000003s)]
*  It was like a knot someone had tied a long time ago [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3864.32s)]
*  in the beginning of my time. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3867.44s)]
*  And in there, in that knot, it was in there somewhere. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3869.1600000000003s)]
*  And I couldn't really even access it. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  It was a, but shame, yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3873.6000000000004s)]
*  I want to hear about shame. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3876.96s)]
*  Did you feel it? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3877.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3879.12s)]
*  How'd you feel? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3882.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, growing up in Hungary, in Eastern Europe, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3885.08s)]
*  and I lived there until I was 13. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3890.16s)]
*  There's a lot of antisemitism. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3894.7599999999998s)]
*  And my grandparents had died in Auschwitz. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3896.72s)]
*  I almost died as an infant, my mother, my father. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3899.96s)]
*  That's when your mother gave you to someone else [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3904.6s)]
*  to save you? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3906.2799999999997s)]
*  That's right, yeah. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3907.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3907.96s)]
*  When I was 11 months of age. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3908.7999999999997s)]
*  But even after the war, there was antisemitism. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3910.04s)]
*  And so I'd feel ashamed of being Jewish. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3914.32s)]
*  I don't anymore, but I did as a kid, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3918.12s)]
*  so I would kind of, then I'd have, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3921.88s)]
*  I was ashamed of my Jewish looks. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3925.04s)]
*  Oh, so you have to hide or you have to feel like, yeah. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3927.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's something different about me [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3929.32s)]
*  that isn't quite right. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  And there was a lot of antisemitism and taunting [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3932.84s)]
*  in the school that I went to when I look back on it now. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3937.1600000000003s)]
*  So yeah, and then I developed body shame. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3940.8s)]
*  To this day, it's kind of, it's interesting. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3946.6400000000003s)]
*  But every day I judge aspects of my body. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3952.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3956.4s)]
*  Like this is not big enough, or this is too big, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3957.2400000000002s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3960.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes, it's too big. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3961.8s)]
*  Yeah, so shame, but shame, nobody's born with shame. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3963.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3968.36s)]
*  No infant is born ashamed of themselves. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3969.2000000000003s)]
*  They're totally there. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3971.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, huh? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3973.4s)]
*  If you saw a little infant that was ashamed of themselves, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3974.36s)]
*  ashamed of himself, it would break your heart. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3976.48s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3979.0800000000004s)]
*  They wouldn't even know how to do it. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3980.32s)]
*  How infants get shamed is when they're not seen. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3981.76s)]
*  And. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3987.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and what happens then? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3987.96s)]
*  Well, or if they're mistreated. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3988.96s)]
*  Well, let's say a child is not seen, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3991.36s)]
*  or worse is being hurt. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3994.52s)]
*  Now they can make two assumptions. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3996.88s)]
*  One is these adults are stupid, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=3999.1200000000003s)]
*  they're incapable, they're incompetent. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4002.0s)]
*  I'm all alone in the world. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4004.84s)]
*  Or the child can believe there's something wrong with me, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4007.2000000000003s)]
*  and maybe if I can work hard enough, I can fix it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4011.1200000000003s)]
*  Now which belief do you think is more [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4014.6800000000003s)]
*  acceptable for the child? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4017.28s)]
*  The second one. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4020.1200000000003s)]
*  So then they develop this deep sense [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4021.6s)]
*  that there's something wrong with us. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4024.04s)]
*  We just have to work hard enough, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4025.4s)]
*  or look good enough for something, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4026.92s)]
*  and then maybe we can fix it. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4028.32s)]
*  So even that shame which comes out from being cut off from, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4029.52s)]
*  it comes from being cut off from human contact [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4034.96s)]
*  the way we need it, has a kind of protective value. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4037.56s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4041.56s)]
*  Because it makes us at least [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4042.4s)]
*  think that there's something we can do. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4045.8s)]
*  Ah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4047.52s)]
*  It almost, it gives us hope in a weird way. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4048.96s)]
*  It gives us hope in a weird way, yeah. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4052.96s)]
*  But it just, but here's the thing. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4054.56s)]
*  Children are narcissists, young children. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4057.72s)]
*  When I say narcissists, I don't mean in a pathological sense. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4061.08s)]
*  I mean in the sense they think it's all about them. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4064.44s)]
*  Right, and they don't have any other choice, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4066.8399999999997s)]
*  they're all they know. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4067.96s)]
*  That's all they know. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4068.7999999999997s)]
*  So if the parents are happy and connected, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4069.68s)]
*  and there's an atmosphere of [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4072.6s)]
*  um, loving acceptance and so on, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4075.16s)]
*  and the child thinks, hey, I must be pretty good. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4079.04s)]
*  I must be okay. Yeah, everything's good. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I'm okay. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4083.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but if the parents are stressed, depressed, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4084.96s)]
*  traumatized, racially challenged, economically challenged, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4088.7599999999998s)]
*  or such terrible things as the children in Gaza [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4095.72s)]
*  are experiencing right now with the daily bombings [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4100.24s)]
*  and all this kind of stuff, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4102.24s)]
*  what can they think? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4103.8s)]
*  That there's something wrong with me. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4105.68s)]
*  Oh, imagine some kid over there in Gaza looking up [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4108.160000000001s)]
*  and there's a bomb, and they think, man, I'm so horrible, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4110.72s)]
*  I deserve to be bombed. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4114.120000000001s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4115.68s)]
*  There was a study done of guys and children. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4116.8s)]
*  Man, that's crazy, I hadn't thought about that. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4118.96s)]
*  Like really, imagine that, though. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4120.52s)]
*  There was a study done of children in Palestine [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4122.68s)]
*  21 years ago, and 95% of those, 95%. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4127.64s)]
*  This is long before the current horrors, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4131.68s)]
*  long before October the 7th, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4134.400000000001s)]
*  long before the aftermath of October the 7th. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4136.160000000001s)]
*  95% of those kids showed traumatic symptoms, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4139.4800000000005s)]
*  high percentage with their beds, like you and I did. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4143.6s)]
*  They expressed aggression towards their parents. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4147.240000000001s)]
*  They had panic attacks, anxiety, fears. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4151.64s)]
*  Can you imagine what's gonna happen to that generation? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4156.92s)]
*  Years from now? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4160.36s)]
*  Years from now, I mean, it just breaks my heart [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4161.2s)]
*  every day when I think about it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4163.599999999999s)]
*  And I know a lot of my fellow Jews don't agree with me, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4165.04s)]
*  but as a Jewish person, I'm not the only one [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4171.28s)]
*  who feels that way, it especially breaks my heart. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4173.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, when you put it in that sense, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4176.48s)]
*  imagine a kid like, you know, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4178.799999999999s)]
*  yeah, because what are they gonna think? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4183.839999999999s)]
*  They don't know, they just think, man, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4185.48s)]
*  something's so wrong with me, I deserve to be bombed. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4187.2s)]
*  I deserve to be killed, you know, or something, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4190.92s)]
*  I don't know, yeah. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4195.36s)]
*  It depends if the adults are able to hold them [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4196.76s)]
*  and keep them feeling loved, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4200.8s)]
*  but 19,000 kids have been orphaned. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4205.28s)]
*  And when I say orphaned, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4208.72s)]
*  I don't mean just that their parents have died, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4210.36s)]
*  their extended families have been wiped out. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4212.5199999999995s)]
*  What's gonna be the future of those kids? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4214.92s)]
*  Pure trauma. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4219.12s)]
*  It's just a terrible. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4219.96s)]
*  No, it's heartbreaking. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4221.12s)]
*  I mean, it feels like a genocide is going on over there [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4221.96s)]
*  and you don't know what to do, you know, for me. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4224.04s)]
*  It's like, you know, I mean, you can pray, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4225.88s)]
*  you can speak up about it. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4230.32s)]
*  And I know that there's like more political aspects of it [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4231.36s)]
*  and we've had different people come on [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4234.08s)]
*  to talk about Israel and Palestine on here [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4235.72s)]
*  and it was very knowledgeable for a lot of our listeners [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4237.72s)]
*  because you hear about it a lot, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4240.639999999999s)]
*  but you don't know the history and everything. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4242.04s)]
*  Well, I've been there. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4244.04s)]
*  I went there two and a half years ago [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4246.16s)]
*  to work with Palestinian women tortured in Israeli jails. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4247.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4251.52s)]
*  And they had post-traumatic stress disorder. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4252.360000000001s)]
*  I've seen it with my own eyes. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4254.280000000001s)]
*  And who's the black American writer, Tenahisi Coates? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4256.4400000000005s)]
*  Tenahisi Coates? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4262.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he just written a new book [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4263.240000000001s)]
*  and he talks about visiting Palestine. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4265.56s)]
*  And he says, yeah, Tenahisi Coates, yeah. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4268.12s)]
*  In his new book, he says, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4272.56s)]
*  once you go there and see it, you can't unsee it. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4274.36s)]
*  Yeah, our media doesn't cover it super fairly. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4279.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4282.16s)]
*  I feel like our media doesn't cover it super fairly. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4283.0s)]
*  That'd be interesting to speak with him then. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4285.08s)]
*  Thank you for bringing his name up. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4286.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4288.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's heartbreaking [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4289.16s)]
*  anytime something's happening to a child, you know? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4290.28s)]
*  That should be the one thing [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4292.719999999999s)]
*  that we can all figure out this shouldn't happen. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4293.5599999999995s)]
*  No, it's also the truth [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4295.32s)]
*  that it's also happening to kids in Israel. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4297.5599999999995s)]
*  There's bombs and rockets and so on. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4300.0s)]
*  I don't know if this is the time [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4303.6s)]
*  to go into the politics of it. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4305.72s)]
*  It's not a question of valuing [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4307.4400000000005s)]
*  or sort of esteeming one's suffering over another. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4311.56s)]
*  We don't compare traumas, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4315.360000000001s)]
*  but the degree and the scale of suffering [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4317.280000000001s)]
*  in Gaza is unprecedented, you know? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4320.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4323.84s)]
*  Look. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4325.04s)]
*  It seems like it. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4325.88s)]
*  When my wife walks into a room, I'm 80. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4326.72s)]
*  I'm typing away, I'm reading a book. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4331.04s)]
*  She walks into the room and I don't hear her. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4332.84s)]
*  All of a sudden I hear her. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4334.200000000001s)]
*  I go like this. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4335.04s)]
*  Not this. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4337.160000000001s)]
*  It's the startle response of an infant. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4338.68s)]
*  If you take a three month old who's sitting there, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4341.56s)]
*  he's lying there and you go like this, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4344.52s)]
*  it's called the startle reflex. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4348.08s)]
*  That's built into me. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4350.12s)]
*  Because when I was three months of age [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4351.400000000001s)]
*  and throughout my first year, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4353.04s)]
*  Budapest was being bombed by the allies. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4355.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4357.12s)]
*  Apart from the anti-Semitism and the genocide, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4358.0s)]
*  there was the war going on. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4361.04s)]
*  So I'd be thrown into a laundry basket [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4362.4800000000005s)]
*  and they'd rush me down to the basement. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4365.04s)]
*  So when I hear a noise, I still go like this. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4366.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4368.96s)]
*  Now this is 80 years later. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4369.96s)]
*  Or when you see a load of laundry go by. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4371.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4373.2s)]
*  Man, so we can stay with, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4374.32s)]
*  so what you're saying is it can stay with you that long? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4375.88s)]
*  It can stay with you that long. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4378.52s)]
*  It gets locked in you, in your cells really. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4379.36s)]
*  It's actually literally locked into your cells [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4381.68s)]
*  and into your chromosomes. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4384.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's heartbreaking [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4386.24s)]
*  for those children on both sides. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4387.48s)]
*  And just anywhere, anytime you think, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4389.0s)]
*  and even a kid when they think, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4391.12s)]
*  even in America, it's like, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4394.44s)]
*  in America it's like we're bombing each other. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4395.88s)]
*  We can't figure out a way. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4398.2s)]
*  There's a huge planet here. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4399.64s)]
*  We can't figure out, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4401.96s)]
*  how can we not figure out a way [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4403.4s)]
*  that we can do, live, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4406.68s)]
*  all God is asking us to do is be alive [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4409.6s)]
*  and do it without war. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4412.44s)]
*  That seems, it seems unreal [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4413.88s)]
*  that we can't figure that out, man. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4417.52s)]
*  Well that, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4419.28s)]
*  I mean the great spiritual teachers [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4421.0s)]
*  have been addressing that insanity [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4424.32s)]
*  for thousands of years, you know? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4426.8s)]
*  Yeah, but how does shame cause us [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4430.68s)]
*  to lose compassion for ourselves? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4432.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4436.08s)]
*  Let me tell you a story. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4439.24s)]
*  I mentioned this in the myth of normal. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4441.32s)]
*  After my book on addiction came out [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4443.839999999999s)]
*  in the realm of hunger ghosts, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4445.5199999999995s)]
*  I got an email, not an email, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4447.5199999999995s)]
*  a letter from a guy in Seattle. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4449.36s)]
*  And he said, I really appreciate your book [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4451.36s)]
*  and showing how trauma causes, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4454.12s)]
*  is one of the, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4458.16s)]
*  addiction is not the only outcome of trauma, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4461.879999999999s)]
*  but it's one of the outcomes of trauma, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4464.839999999999s)]
*  one of the potential outcomes of trauma. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4466.32s)]
*  And he's really appreciate all that, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4468.5599999999995s)]
*  but he says, I can't blame my mother, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4470.04s)]
*  it's my own fault that I'm a shit. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4472.5599999999995s)]
*  And I thought, oh my God, you poor guy. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4475.44s)]
*  You still see yourself that way, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4478.839999999999s)]
*  but lack of compassion. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4480.799999999999s)]
*  Because if he actually understood, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4483.5599999999995s)]
*  fully understood that he was just a baby [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4484.92s)]
*  at some point, needing and wanting to be loved [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4487.36s)]
*  and held and seen and valued, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4490.16s)]
*  just for being a human being, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4494.36s)]
*  and that didn't happen to him, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4496.88s)]
*  and that caused so much pain in him [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4498.52s)]
*  that he escaped into some drug addiction. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4500.84s)]
*  He's not a shit, he's just a hurt human being. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4506.52s)]
*  But that lack of self-compassion, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4509.8s)]
*  I see it all the time in my workshops [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4512.92s)]
*  when I do therapy work with people. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4515.52s)]
*  One of my main tasks is to help them to notice, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4517.8s)]
*  not to criticize them for it, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4523.52s)]
*  but to help them to be aware of [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4525.639999999999s)]
*  why they lack compassion for themselves. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4526.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to even notice [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4528.679999999999s)]
*  that you're getting in the shame circle. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4530.719999999999s)]
*  It's so hard to even notice that you're in it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4532.16s)]
*  You can be living in the center of it. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4534.36s)]
*  That's how I was with self-pity. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4536.679999999999s)]
*  I was living, I just didn't realize it. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4538.2s)]
*  And the self-pity was manifesting itself like, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4540.639999999999s)]
*  oh, you can figure this out. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4543.04s)]
*  But by trying to constantly help myself figure it out, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4545.16s)]
*  all I was doing was focusing on my own [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4548.24s)]
*  being not good enough, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4550.48s)]
*  which in a way is really just self-compassion. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4552.639999999999s)]
*  It's really just self-pity. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4554.96s)]
*  But it's also lack of self-compassion. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4556.92s)]
*  Yeah, not giving myself some grace. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4559.04s)]
*  I remember the first time somebody said, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4560.68s)]
*  hey man, give yourself some grace. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4562.2s)]
*  I'd never even, I was like, wow. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4563.64s)]
*  Because people find themselves accusing themselves [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4566.44s)]
*  and talking to themselves [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4571.68s)]
*  in ways that they would never talk to others. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4573.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4575.0s)]
*  But most people wouldn't. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4575.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4577.24s)]
*  Some would, but most wouldn't. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4578.08s)]
*  Can you notice characteristics [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4580.64s)]
*  or actualities in your life today [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4584.64s)]
*  that you can directly correlate [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4586.8s)]
*  to side effects of childhood trauma? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4588.04s)]
*  My own? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4590.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4591.160000000001s)]
*  Well, my capacity to get triggered. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4594.04s)]
*  But you see, triggered is an interesting word [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4600.12s)]
*  because we keep using it, but what does it mean? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4603.08s)]
*  Well, it means a reaction that's way out of proportion [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4606.16s)]
*  to the actual stimulus. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4610.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4613.24s)]
*  But when you actually look at where the metaphor comes from, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4614.08s)]
*  comes from a gun. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4618.08s)]
*  Now, how big a part of the gun is the trigger? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4620.36s)]
*  Small. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4622.76s)]
*  Small little part. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4623.599999999999s)]
*  What makes the trigger work is that there's ammunition [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4625.28s)]
*  and an explosive charge. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4627.76s)]
*  So as long as I'm full of explosive charge, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4629.28s)]
*  which is my unresolved trauma, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4631.48s)]
*  some of you will say boo, and I'll go, ooh. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4633.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4635.68s)]
*  So my capacity to get triggered, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4636.52s)]
*  my difficulty believing that I was really loved [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4639.44s)]
*  and accepted in my marriage relationship, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4644.44s)]
*  even though I was. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4646.36s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4647.64s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4648.48s)]
*  My tendency to blame others for my own reactions [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4650.52s)]
*  rather than taking responsibility. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4655.92s)]
*  In there. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4658.92s)]
*  We mentioned the addictive behaviors. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4659.76s)]
*  Certainly the first book I wrote in ADHD [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4662.160000000001s)]
*  is called Scattered Minds. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4666.240000000001s)]
*  My scattered mind is certainly an outcome of early stress, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4667.68s)]
*  because I mean, that dissociation, that tuning out, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4672.120000000001s)]
*  it's just an escape mechanism. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4674.56s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4676.280000000001s)]
*  So the way I, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4677.120000000001s)]
*  I think I'm not going to go into it, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4680.8s)]
*  the way I was unable to see my kids [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4683.64s)]
*  for the beautiful, sensitive creatures that they were. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4687.0s)]
*  In my workaholism, oh, it's showing up in so many ways. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4693.04s)]
*  You said that not believing that people love us. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4697.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4701.16s)]
*  That's, dude, that's huge, man. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4702.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4704.200000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4705.04s)]
*  Why do we sometimes, you'll be in a marriage, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4705.88s)]
*  in a relationship, and we'll still believe [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4709.76s)]
*  that person, they don't love me, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4711.6s)]
*  or we won't believe their affections. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4713.64s)]
*  What did you say? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4715.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we won't believe we're loved, you know, or accepted. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4716.64s)]
*  Well, Peter Levine, who's one of the great trauma teachers, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4720.200000000001s)]
*  he talked about trauma being the tyranny of the past. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4724.240000000001s)]
*  So- [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4728.96s)]
*  The attorney of the past? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4729.8s)]
*  The tyranny. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4730.64s)]
*  The tyranny of the past. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4731.4800000000005s)]
*  So we're in the present moment, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4732.400000000001s)]
*  but we're actually reacting to the past. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4734.52s)]
*  Now, throughout the first year of my life, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4738.64s)]
*  given our situation, my mother was really stressed, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4743.56s)]
*  unhappy, even terrorized. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4747.4400000000005s)]
*  She couldn't give me that calm, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4750.280000000001s)]
*  or tuned loving attention that I needed. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4753.280000000001s)]
*  She did her best, for God's sakes. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4755.320000000001s)]
*  You know, what could be greater love [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4757.56s)]
*  than for a 24-year-old young woman [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4759.76s)]
*  to give her baby to a total stranger in the street? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4761.56s)]
*  You know, but how do I experience it? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4765.04s)]
*  I experience it as a rejection. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4768.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4770.68s)]
*  So the person that ought to be loving me is giving me away. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4771.52s)]
*  I can only conclude from that that I'm not lovable. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4775.76s)]
*  Ah, I see. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4779.280000000001s)]
*  Now, once I don't think I'm lovable, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4780.320000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna believe that anybody actually loves me, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4783.8s)]
*  no matter what they manifest or what they show me. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4788.76s)]
*  You know, and then I blaming them [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4789.6s)]
*  for my own sense of unlovability. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4792.52s)]
*  Now, this is unprocessed trauma we're talking about. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4797.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4799.48s)]
*  You know? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4800.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've almost even thought it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4801.16s)]
*  Sometimes I thought like, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4802.4s)]
*  oh, you're dumb for loving me. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4805.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but that's the other side of it. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4807.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Garcho Marx said, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4810.4s)]
*  that I wouldn't belong to a club [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4813.08s)]
*  that would have me as a member. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4814.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4815.84s)]
*  So anybody would love me. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4817.24s)]
*  They can't be very bright, can they? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4820.16s)]
*  They must be out of their minds. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4822.0s)]
*  You talk also about not parent blaming, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4824.16s)]
*  which I think is really important. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4826.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4828.0s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about that? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4828.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, look. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4830.88s)]
*  I mean, your story right there about your mother [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4834.72s)]
*  gave you away because it was the, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4836.12s)]
*  yeah, I mean, imagine the terror, the pain in her, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4837.64s)]
*  of like, the only, the most loving thing I can do [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4840.84s)]
*  is put my child somewhere else away from me right now [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4844.28s)]
*  for its own safety. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4846.4400000000005s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4847.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4848.360000000001s)]
*  Well, all parents, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4850.08s)]
*  we're born with a caring instinct, you know? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4853.88s)]
*  Like we're born with certain emotional systems [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4856.08s)]
*  in our brain. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4859.72s)]
*  Play is one of them. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4861.2s)]
*  Curiosity seeking, the dopamine circuit is another one. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4862.68s)]
*  Caring, loving is another one. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4866.16s)]
*  We're just born with that. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4868.320000000001s)]
*  We are? It's instinctual. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4869.84s)]
*  All mammals are born with it. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4871.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4872.400000000001s)]
*  No mammal infant would survive without it. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4873.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4875.64s)]
*  So I don't, I never doubt that parents love their kids, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4877.88s)]
*  that there's at least an impulse in them to do so. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4881.36s)]
*  But the love that the parent feels is not that the love [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4884.5599999999995s)]
*  what the parent child receives. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4888.84s)]
*  What the child receives is the quality [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4891.92s)]
*  of the parent's presence. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4894.48s)]
*  Are they calm? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4897.599999999999s)]
*  Are they attuned? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4898.759999999999s)]
*  Are they emotionally present? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4900.719999999999s)]
*  Are they preoccupied, stressed, depressed, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4902.92s)]
*  traumatized, overworked, whatever? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4904.92s)]
*  Any of those conditions, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4908.5599999999995s)]
*  the child does not experience the love [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4910.16s)]
*  in its whole sense. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4915.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4917.12s)]
*  So even though you might know that your mother loved you, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4917.96s)]
*  and I'm sure she did in her own way, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4920.84s)]
*  and she did her very best, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4922.5599999999995s)]
*  but she was not able to give you those qualities [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4924.32s)]
*  that you would really in your heart experience as love. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4927.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4930.28s)]
*  You know? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4931.12s)]
*  And so in this society where, as you said earlier, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4931.96s)]
*  parents have to go to work just to put bread on the table, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4936.0s)]
*  and where so many people are economically insecure, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4940.4400000000005s)]
*  where there's so much stress, so much division, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4943.04s)]
*  so much angst, so much aggression, so much suspicion. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4945.16s)]
*  What's it like to be a parent? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4952.76s)]
*  It's really, really difficult. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4954.52s)]
*  And don't forget, we didn't evolve in nuclear families. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4956.2s)]
*  We evolved in groups where kids around, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4961.08s)]
*  nurturing adults the whole day, including their parents, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4964.84s)]
*  but not only their parents. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4969.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4970.639999999999s)]
*  So in today's society, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4971.48s)]
*  parenting has become almost an impossible task. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4973.28s)]
*  Why would I blame any parent? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4975.759999999999s)]
*  And I'll even say this, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4978.5199999999995s)]
*  and I'm not trying to excuse anything, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4980.679999999999s)]
*  because there's no excuse. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4983.04s)]
*  That's not the point. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4985.16s)]
*  But if you look at parents who abuse their kids, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4987.16s)]
*  what happened to them as kids? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4989.639999999999s)]
*  They were abused, for sure. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4990.919999999999s)]
*  It's multigenerational. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4992.24s)]
*  It's not that they grow up, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4994.32s)]
*  it's not that they decide I'm gonna abuse my kids. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4995.679999999999s)]
*  They just act out what happened to them. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=4999.04s)]
*  So I think blame, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5001.5199999999995s)]
*  now, responsibility is one thing, blame is another. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5005.44s)]
*  I think blame is totally unscientific, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5011.28s)]
*  it's cruel, and it's totally inappropriate. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5013.16s)]
*  So as much as I point out the impact of early experience, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5015.6s)]
*  there's obviously no room for blaming parents. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5021.5199999999995s)]
*  And Theo, what's really interesting to me [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5023.56s)]
*  is after I wrote my book on addiction, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5027.24s)]
*  occasionally some strange person would come up to me [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5030.76s)]
*  and said, my child died of an overdose, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5034.44s)]
*  and I thank you for writing the book. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5037.12s)]
*  And I always find that a bit startling, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5039.32s)]
*  because in the book I'm saying that it's childhood experience [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5042.92s)]
*  and trauma that ultimately result in addiction, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5045.719999999999s)]
*  and they say, you know what, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5048.679999999999s)]
*  because I finally get it. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5049.84s)]
*  I finally understand what happened. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5051.599999999999s)]
*  And I get it as multigenerational, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5053.36s)]
*  that it's nobody's fault. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5055.36s)]
*  There's nobody to be blamed here. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5057.88s)]
*  The question is, in each generation, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5059.24s)]
*  can we take responsibility [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5062.5199999999995s)]
*  so we don't pass it on to the next one? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5064.76s)]
*  But blame, there's no room for it. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5067.0s)]
*  And Robert Sapolsky, the scientist who I quoted, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5070.5199999999995s)]
*  he said, there's just no room for blame. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5075.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's not, yeah, you can have discussions [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5080.36s)]
*  about responsibility and things like that, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5083.56s)]
*  and share, hey, I think you could have been [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5086.36s)]
*  more responsible about this, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5088.48s)]
*  or seeing something that was somebody's responsibility, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5089.88s)]
*  but yeah. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5092.84s)]
*  And you can even be angry. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5093.679999999999s)]
*  Right, we can be angry. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5095.36s)]
*  Without blaming. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5096.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5097.84s)]
*  Because why wouldn't you be angry [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5098.799999999999s)]
*  when those things happen to you? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5101.2s)]
*  So it's not a question of telling people don't be angry, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5102.84s)]
*  but having anger and owning it is not the same as [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5105.759999999999s)]
*  saying you did something deliberately [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5110.679999999999s)]
*  that you shouldn't have done, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5112.32s)]
*  and you shouldn't have known better, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5113.28s)]
*  and you've said terrible. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5114.28s)]
*  So there's anger, healthy anger, necessary anger, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5117.12s)]
*  and then there's the expectation [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5120.719999999999s)]
*  that people take responsibility, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5127.16s)]
*  each for ourselves, and then there's blame, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5130.48s)]
*  which is a whole other bag of monkeys. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5133.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a zoo we don't need to be involved in. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5137.599999999999s)]
*  No, we don't need that. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5141.0s)]
*  What makes you laugh? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5143.2s)]
*  Like, is there like shows you like to watch, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5147.28s)]
*  or a thing you like? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5149.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, sometimes what makes me laugh [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5150.36s)]
*  is my own ridiculousness. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5151.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5152.88s)]
*  I mean. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5153.72s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes me too. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5155.16s)]
*  I know it's gonna be a good day [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5156.96s)]
*  if I find that I'm laughing at myself. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5158.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well, there's so many. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5159.92s)]
*  You know, like the little human ego is, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5161.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5164.0s)]
*  we can be compassionate towards it, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5165.16s)]
*  but on the other hand, it's so ridiculous. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5166.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5168.36s)]
*  So we can laugh at ourselves. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5169.2s)]
*  My wife and I laugh a lot. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5172.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you do? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5174.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's one of our saving. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5174.92s)]
*  It's been 55 years in a month, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5179.44s)]
*  and I tell you, we've laughed so much together [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5182.639999999999s)]
*  at ourselves, at each other. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5185.12s)]
*  That's adorable. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5187.4s)]
*  You know? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5188.36s)]
*  What makes me laugh? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5190.88s)]
*  Usually absurdity. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5192.44s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5193.8s)]
*  When things are absurd, they make me laugh. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5194.639999999999s)]
*  You know, the sort of touch of reality. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5196.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5198.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5199.639999999999s)]
*  Those are the things that make me laugh. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5200.879999999999s)]
*  Is there like a film that you like, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5202.919999999999s)]
*  or like what's a movie that you like? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5204.639999999999s)]
*  I'm just trying to just know a little bit more about you. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5205.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5208.0s)]
*  A movie that made me laugh. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5209.879999999999s)]
*  Or just a couple movies. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5211.679999999999s)]
*  A fish called Wanda. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5212.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5213.839999999999s)]
*  Talking about Jamie Lee Curtis. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5214.679999999999s)]
*  That, I roared my head off about that one. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5217.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5220.44s)]
*  I don't have such a good memory for that kind of stuff. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5222.959999999999s)]
*  A funny book will make me laugh. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5227.679999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5229.4s)]
*  You know? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5230.76s)]
*  Yeah, do you have a favorite, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5232.16s)]
*  one, or just a fiction book that you like? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5233.719999999999s)]
*  I tend to go for the classics. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5237.44s)]
*  So I keep rereading the Eliad by Homer. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5240.599999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5243.48s)]
*  With the Trojan War. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5244.32s)]
*  I keep rereading Dostoevsky. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5245.679999999999s)]
*  I just reread The Brothers Karamazov last year. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5250.5599999999995s)]
*  Because he's such a deep, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5255.639999999999s)]
*  such a deep understanding of the human soul. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5257.8s)]
*  The darkness and the lightness, both. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5260.92s)]
*  Of the human soul. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5264.2s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5266.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5267.68s)]
*  So I tend to go for the classics myself. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5269.5199999999995s)]
*  I read some other novels, but not that often. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5272.04s)]
*  The Eliad, yeah. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5274.8s)]
*  No, by the way, you know what made me laugh? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5275.64s)]
*  Catch-22. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5276.8s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5278.08s)]
*  I reread that a couple years ago. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5278.92s)]
*  I split a gut. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5280.76s)]
*  Who was it, not John Simek, who wrote that? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5281.92s)]
*  Joseph Heller. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5284.4s)]
*  Joseph Heller, Catch-22. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5285.32s)]
*  I think it was Joseph Heller is his first name. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5286.88s)]
*  We had to read that, I think, in school. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5290.84s)]
*  Well, by modern standards, there's some parts of it [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5292.64s)]
*  that are really sexist and misogynist, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5298.64s)]
*  and in some places even racist. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5301.92s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5304.56s)]
*  So I'm not making any excuse for that. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5307.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5309.28s)]
*  It was the Zeitgeist at the time. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5310.12s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5311.4s)]
*  But it's just reproingly funny about the absurdity of war [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5312.24s)]
*  and the self-puffery of important people. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5317.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5322.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5323.719999999999s)]
*  I'll have to check it out, man. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5325.0s)]
*  I think I had to read it some time, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5326.32s)]
*  but maybe in college we had to read it. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5328.36s)]
*  Did you ever read John Irving any of his books? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5329.88s)]
*  Like The World According to Garp, remember that book? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5333.48s)]
*  You know, I started reading that decades ago [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5336.5199999999995s)]
*  and never finished it. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5338.2s)]
*  Yeah, that happened. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5339.04s)]
*  Some of his books, his latest book is, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5339.88s)]
*  I don't even know what it is, it's very long. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5342.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5344.44s)]
*  I mean, you need to bring a tent with you, you know? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5345.28s)]
*  Recently there was a book that's got a lot of attention, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5348.16s)]
*  Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5352.5199999999995s)]
*  and she wrote Poisonwood Bible. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5356.24s)]
*  That's her most famous book. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5358.88s)]
*  But Demon Copperhead is a kind of a modern take [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5360.76s)]
*  on David Copperfield by Charles Dickens [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5365.32s)]
*  and it takes place in Appalachia. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5370.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5372.5199999999995s)]
*  And I just saw an interview with her yesterday [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5373.36s)]
*  where she goes after JD Vance. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5375.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5377.879999999999s)]
*  Because she's in Appalachia. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5378.719999999999s)]
*  Right, so they're both from that area. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5379.92s)]
*  They're both from that area. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5381.679999999999s)]
*  With different mindsets. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5382.5199999999995s)]
*  And she's saying, buddy, you don't represent us. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5383.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5386.04s)]
*  And Demon Copperhead takes on the hillbilly image [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5387.0s)]
*  of Appalachians and plays with it beautifully. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5393.48s)]
*  Wow, I'd love to check that out. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5397.32s)]
*  She seems like an interesting woman. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5398.799999999999s)]
*  She's a very interesting woman. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5400.32s)]
*  I bet. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5401.4s)]
*  She's very thoughtful, very forthright. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5402.24s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5404.2s)]
*  Maybe after I read the book, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5405.88s)]
*  I could see if she would want to come and visit. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5407.0s)]
*  Sometimes I always feel like I have to explain my intentions. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5410.0s)]
*  There's a part of me that always feels [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5415.44s)]
*  like I'm manipulating somebody. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5416.8s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5418.24s)]
*  That's not a feeling. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5419.68s)]
*  So what is it? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5421.6s)]
*  It's a thought? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5422.44s)]
*  It's a belief. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5423.26s)]
*  It's a belief. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5424.1s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5424.94s)]
*  And there's a reason why you have it. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5426.48s)]
*  Even if I'm just doing something nice, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5432.56s)]
*  there's a part of me that's like, oh, you're. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5433.8s)]
*  Yeah, you think you're fake. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5435.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5436.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's called the imposter syndrome. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5437.320000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5438.8s)]
*  And it has to do with the fact [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5439.64s)]
*  that you couldn't be real as a kid. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5443.04s)]
*  In some ways, you had to pretend. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5446.28s)]
*  And it's really hard to let go of that, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5449.52s)]
*  of that sense that I'm still doing it. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5455.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5457.76s)]
*  It's what you grew up with. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5458.6s)]
*  So you could be kind to that part of yourself. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5459.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5462.0s)]
*  And that's the part that you could actually, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5462.96s)]
*  because it's not a feeling, you know, Theo. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5466.52s)]
*  It's a belief. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5468.24s)]
*  And a belief can be, you don't argue with feelings, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5469.28s)]
*  but beliefs you can challenge. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5472.16s)]
*  Is it really true that you're manipulating? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5474.44s)]
*  Like when you're talking to me now, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5476.6s)]
*  are we having a genuine conversation? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5478.68s)]
*  I believe that we are. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5480.6s)]
*  Or is it true that you're actually manipulating me [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5481.44s)]
*  in any way at all? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5483.4s)]
*  No, I don't think I am. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5484.64s)]
*  And furthermore, give me some credit. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5486.0s)]
*  Maybe you can't manipulate me even if you wanted to. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5489.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5492.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5493.04s)]
*  So that... [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5493.88s)]
*  That's very fair, dude. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5496.88s)]
*  So that fear of yours is both lack of compassion [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5498.44s)]
*  towards yourself and a lack of, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5502.92s)]
*  in a sense, trust in the other person's capacity [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5509.0s)]
*  to look after themselves. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5511.36s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5512.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5514.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's just funny. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5515.84s)]
*  I was just talking with my brother yesterday [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5516.679999999999s)]
*  because we had similar childhoods and we were thinking of, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5518.08s)]
*  well, what are some things that I could think about [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5519.8s)]
*  to talk with him about? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5521.28s)]
*  And we were talking about that, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5522.96s)]
*  that sometimes we always feel like there's something, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5524.24s)]
*  like we're manipulating ourselves, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5528.28s)]
*  or that our ability to manipulate would be so powerful [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5529.96s)]
*  that we wouldn't even know what we're doing, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5532.36s)]
*  which is pretty crazy, too. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5534.96s)]
*  It's a lack of self-trust. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5536.16s)]
*  Lack of self-trust. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5537.24s)]
*  Now, you know what? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5538.08s)]
*  Have I manipulated? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5538.92s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5540.2s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5541.04s)]
*  You know? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5541.88s)]
*  Same. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5542.719999999999s)]
*  But it's just not a question that one never does it, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5543.5599999999995s)]
*  but I know when I'm manipulating. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5546.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5547.84s)]
*  And usually it's because I want something [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5548.679999999999s)]
*  that I don't know how to state directly, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5550.52s)]
*  or I'm afraid that I might not get otherwise. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5553.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5555.4400000000005s)]
*  And then I'm afraid to show up with my vulnerable request. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5556.280000000001s)]
*  Which would make sense as a child. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5560.56s)]
*  There was something you wanted [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5561.84s)]
*  that you didn't think you were gonna get otherwise. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5562.84s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5564.64s)]
*  So you didn't show it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5565.4800000000005s)]
*  So it makes sense. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5566.3s)]
*  Children... [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5567.320000000001s)]
*  Children manipulate out of a sense of weakness. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5570.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's pretty much all they can do [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5573.320000000001s)]
*  if otherwise they don't get their needs met. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5578.080000000001s)]
*  A lot of your book that I've read so far, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5581.360000000001s)]
*  it's getting to the part where it's like [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5584.4800000000005s)]
*  that Western medicine doesn't always take into context [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5587.280000000001s)]
*  as much that the body and the mind, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5591.200000000001s)]
*  like us as an entire thing, as our society, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5594.360000000001s)]
*  as you know, it's almost like, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5597.280000000001s)]
*  like if say if like the whole world, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5600.52s)]
*  and time, and culture, and everything were a car, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5602.76s)]
*  instead of the doctor looking at the car, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5608.56s)]
*  they just look at the human, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5610.68s)]
*  which would just be one part of the car. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5612.0s)]
*  And so they're always just working on this one part [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5614.0s)]
*  instead of looking at the whole car, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5616.4400000000005s)]
*  which could also be a cause [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5618.820000000001s)]
*  of why the part isn't doing well. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5620.6s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5623.0s)]
*  And see, we have to make a distinction here. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5623.96s)]
*  There's Western science, then there's medical practice. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5628.96s)]
*  Understood. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5632.64s)]
*  The two are not the same necessarily. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5633.4800000000005s)]
*  So I was trained as a medical doctor. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5635.4800000000005s)]
*  Nobody ever taught me about the mind-body unity. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5637.56s)]
*  But physiologically, you can't separate the mind [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5641.280000000001s)]
*  from the body so that our emotional circuits [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5643.96s)]
*  and the immune system and the hormonal apparatus [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5649.120000000001s)]
*  and the nervous system are actually one system. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5652.68s)]
*  They're not separate systems. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5655.72s)]
*  So when things happen emotionally, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5657.5s)]
*  naturally they have a physiological effect. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5659.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5661.52s)]
*  You know, so I could give you 10,000 examples. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5662.360000000001s)]
*  Children whose parents are stressed [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5666.88s)]
*  are much more likely to have asthma. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5668.76s)]
*  Children of what? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5671.32s)]
*  Children whose parents are stressed [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5672.68s)]
*  are much more likely to have asthma. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5675.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5677.360000000001s)]
*  So their airway is narrow and they get inflamed. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5678.2s)]
*  Black, there's a study that showed [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5681.860000000001s)]
*  that black American women, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5683.92s)]
*  the more episodes of racism they experience, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5685.68s)]
*  the higher the risk of asthma. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5688.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5690.16s)]
*  It's been shown that women with severe PTSD [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5692.22s)]
*  have double the risk of ovarian cancer. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5696.24s)]
*  This is a study out of Harvard University. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5699.0s)]
*  Adults who experience the loss of an adult child [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5702.679999999999s)]
*  have a higher risk of malignancy of the bone marrow [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5706.36s)]
*  and the blood. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5710.36s)]
*  Grief. Grief. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5712.179999999999s)]
*  A Danish study, parents who lost a child [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5714.5599999999995s)]
*  have double the risk of multiple sclerosis. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5717.599999999999s)]
*  There are hundreds of studies showing [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5720.58s)]
*  the physiological impact of stress and trauma [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5723.96s)]
*  and loss on the physiology. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5728.4400000000005s)]
*  So manifesting itself in our bodies as a disease [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5732.0s)]
*  or contributing to... [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5734.4400000000005s)]
*  Contributing to the onset of the disease. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5736.08s)]
*  Got it. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5738.28s)]
*  Yeah, because cancer, it's like, you know, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5739.12s)]
*  you say in the book, like, people get cancer. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5740.52s)]
*  A lot of times you hear like, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5743.72s)]
*  the guy got cancer, he died three weeks later, right? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5744.56s)]
*  You hear that all the time. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5746.72s)]
*  But the cancer had been there forever. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5747.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5749.68s)]
*  And it just, enough had happened, I guess, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5750.52s)]
*  that it turned over into being... [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5753.48s)]
*  Well, we know that stress, for example, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5755.919999999999s)]
*  can turn off genes that protect you against cancer [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5759.58s)]
*  and turn on genes that can cause cancer. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5764.58s)]
*  Really? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5767.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5767.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's not even controversial. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5768.74s)]
*  And we know that people that repress their healthy anger, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5770.5599999999995s)]
*  they're actually suppressing their immune system. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5775.4s)]
*  And this stuff has been studied over and over again [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5779.5s)]
*  and great clinicians have been recognizing this forever. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5782.44s)]
*  And in 2400 years ago, Socrates, the Greek philosopher, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5788.28s)]
*  said that the problem with the doctors of today [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5793.28s)]
*  is that they separate the mind from the body. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5796.54s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5798.44s)]
*  2400 years ago. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5799.28s)]
*  Now, I can name you any number of great medical pioneers, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5800.099999999999s)]
*  I mentioned some of them in the book, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5804.919999999999s)]
*  who 150 years ago, 100 years ago, 80 years ago, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5806.48s)]
*  40 years ago, pointed out that mind and body [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5810.72s)]
*  can't be separated, that in fact, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5813.84s)]
*  we are biopsychosocial creatures, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5815.76s)]
*  which means that our biology is inseparable [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5819.12s)]
*  from our psyche or emotional apparatus [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5822.58s)]
*  and from our social relationships. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5824.8s)]
*  Wow, so all of it. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5826.56s)]
*  It's all one. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5827.76s)]
*  Scientifically, it's all one. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5829.240000000001s)]
*  The problem is medical practice [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5830.8s)]
*  doesn't recognize that oneness. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5832.8s)]
*  So most of the time, you go to a physician [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5834.4800000000005s)]
*  with a rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5838.0s)]
*  for both of which, there's plenty of evidence [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5841.0s)]
*  about the role of trauma and stress, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5843.72s)]
*  but the doctor's never gonna ask you [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5845.84s)]
*  about any of that stuff. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5847.2s)]
*  They're just gonna deal with the physical aspects of it, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5848.52s)]
*  which they should deal with, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5852.4s)]
*  but they also need to look at the whole, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5854.3s)]
*  what happened in this person's life [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5857.28s)]
*  and what's stressing them now [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5859.48s)]
*  and how can we help with that part of it? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5861.8s)]
*  So medical practice, as a doctor, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5864.56s)]
*  I don't know if to be told how miraculously effective [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5869.26s)]
*  the achievements of modern medicine can be, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5874.240000000001s)]
*  but at the same time, there's a huge piece [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5876.68s)]
*  that we're missing, and that piece is not just intuitive [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5878.96s)]
*  or spiritual, woohoo, it's science, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5883.120000000001s)]
*  but they don't teach that mind, body, unity, science [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5886.42s)]
*  in the medical schools. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5889.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, the piece is a whole. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5891.200000000001s)]
*  That's what they're missing. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5892.9800000000005s)]
*  They're missing the wholeness. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5894.68s)]
*  Now, if you look at the indigenous medicine, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5895.76s)]
*  there's the medicine wheel, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5898.4s)]
*  which consists of four quadrants. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5900.6s)]
*  There's the physical, our physiology. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5903.28s)]
*  There's the mental, which is our emotions and our thoughts. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5907.2s)]
*  There's the social, which is our relationships [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5911.12s)]
*  with other people and other creatures, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5913.96s)]
*  and then there's the spiritual, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5916.4s)]
*  which is our connection with something greater [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5918.22s)]
*  than just our little ego, however you define that, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5920.06s)]
*  and health, they say, depends on the balance [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5924.360000000001s)]
*  between those four quadrants. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5927.240000000001s)]
*  Scientifically, that's totally true, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5928.88s)]
*  but unfortunately, that science is largely ignored [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5932.860000000001s)]
*  in medical training. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5937.320000000001s)]
*  I'm sure, yeah. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5939.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, especially now, a lot of our medicine [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5940.56s)]
*  has kind of been compromised, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5942.200000000001s)]
*  or I think our industry has, you know? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5943.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5944.96s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know, and I don't know your industry, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5945.8s)]
*  and I'm not trying to offend it, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5947.72s)]
*  but it certainly seems like just, you know, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5949.12s)]
*  it's been, most industries have been compromised, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5952.78s)]
*  you know, the fact to have better, you know, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5956.7s)]
*  balance sheets than... [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5961.0599999999995s)]
*  But look, if you come to me with depression, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5963.58s)]
*  by the way, that's another diagnosis that I've had, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5967.9s)]
*  so I've actually taken medication for depression, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5970.34s)]
*  so I'm not here to... [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5972.98s)]
*  You're not just guessing. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5975.139999999999s)]
*  You know, to dismiss them. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5976.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5978.42s)]
*  But if you look at the word depression, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5979.9s)]
*  what does it actually mean to depress something? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5982.379999999999s)]
*  Hold it back. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5985.54s)]
*  Is to push it down, yeah? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5986.379999999999s)]
*  Now, what gets pushed on in depression? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5988.219999999999s)]
*  Your feelings. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5990.0599999999995s)]
*  Our feelings. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5990.98s)]
*  Now, why would a person push on their feelings? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5992.219999999999s)]
*  One of the needs of the child, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5995.139999999999s)]
*  one of the essential needs of the child, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5997.66s)]
*  as I point out in this book, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=5999.379999999999s)]
*  I don't make this stuff up, I just report it, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6001.42s)]
*  is to be able to experience all their emotions, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6003.86s)]
*  anger, grief, fear, panic, love, playfulness, curiosity, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6007.38s)]
*  lust for life and just hunger for life. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6018.46s)]
*  The child doesn't need to express all those emotions [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6021.18s)]
*  when they arise and have that understood, accepted, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6024.02s)]
*  and validated by the adults. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6027.06s)]
*  Now, if I'm in an environment [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6029.38s)]
*  where the parents can't do that, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6032.42s)]
*  you've had guests on this program, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6034.54s)]
*  I won't mention them by name, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6036.14s)]
*  who teach that an angry child should be made [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6037.820000000001s)]
*  to sit by themselves until they come back to normal. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6040.700000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6044.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6044.9400000000005s)]
*  A two-year-old kid gets frustrated, they get angry. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6045.780000000001s)]
*  If you give that kid the message [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6050.26s)]
*  that if you're angry, you can't be with me, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6052.34s)]
*  the child is an impossible dilemma. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6054.62s)]
*  Am I gonna separate myself from the person [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6058.34s)]
*  on whom my life depends, or will I push down my anger? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6062.34s)]
*  Well, give that message to the kid often enough, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6066.54s)]
*  what are they gonna do? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6068.700000000001s)]
*  Depress their feelings. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6070.54s)]
*  30 years later, they're diagnosed [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6073.54s)]
*  with this disease called depression. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6075.34s)]
*  Now, if you come to me with depression, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6079.06s)]
*  I might decide that temporarily it might be a good idea [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6082.660000000001s)]
*  for you to be in antidepressants. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6086.46s)]
*  And I've taken them, they helped me for a while, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6088.62s)]
*  but it's not enough. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6094.06s)]
*  Let's also look at what made you push down your feelings, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6096.62s)]
*  what happened to you. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6099.82s)]
*  Now, prescribing the antidepressant takes me three minutes. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6101.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6105.82s)]
*  Talking with you about what actually happened to you [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6107.0199999999995s)]
*  that made you push down your feelings, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6111.259999999999s)]
*  that takes a long time. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6113.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6114.9s)]
*  And doctors are not even trained to raise that question. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6115.74s)]
*  So even if as a physician, I don't have the expertise [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6118.179999999999s)]
*  to deal with that question, at least I could refer you [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6122.46s)]
*  to somebody who does. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6125.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6126.5s)]
*  But no, most of the time, it's just the industrial model. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6127.46s)]
*  You come in, I got five minutes with you, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6130.900000000001s)]
*  here's the prescription, goodbye. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6133.02s)]
*  Well, that doesn't deal with the underlying problem. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6135.860000000001s)]
*  It deals with the symptom, which may sometimes be helpful, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6139.02s)]
*  sometimes it isn't, but whether it's helpful or not, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6142.62s)]
*  it does not deal with the underlying dynamic. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6146.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6151.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's just, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6152.9800000000005s)]
*  and it's just where our society is too, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6156.1s)]
*  we've gone so far down this road, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6157.860000000001s)]
*  and it's just like, how do we, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6160.38s)]
*  yeah, back in the day, it seemed like if you were like, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6163.66s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy, but if you were like just [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6166.780000000001s)]
*  a small group around a campfire, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6169.38s)]
*  you could see if somebody was hurting you. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6171.1s)]
*  There was, everything was right there, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6174.02s)]
*  you couldn't hide anything. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6176.1s)]
*  Not only that, you know what you would do? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6177.54s)]
*  You'd do ceremonies, healing rituals. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6179.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6182.14s)]
*  You would dance, you would chant, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6183.299999999999s)]
*  you would shake a stick, ebikamuno. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6186.0599999999995s)]
*  A friend of mine who I quote in the book, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6189.86s)]
*  he's a part Lakota physician and psychiatrist. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6191.62s)]
*  His name is Luis Mel Madrona, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6197.099999999999s)]
*  and he said in the Lakota tradition, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6199.0599999999995s)]
*  when somebody gets sick, the community says, thank you. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6201.459999999999s)]
*  Your illness represents some imbalance in our community. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6206.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6209.259999999999s)]
*  You're like the canary in the mine. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6210.099999999999s)]
*  So your healing is our healing. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6212.06s)]
*  So let's do this together. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6213.900000000001s)]
*  Now that makes so much sense. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6215.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6217.18s)]
*  Both scientifically and emotionally. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6218.02s)]
*  We don't do that. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6221.860000000001s)]
*  We sort of isolate the individual, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6222.700000000001s)]
*  then we separate the mind from the body. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6224.660000000001s)]
*  So we say it's just a brain problem. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6226.780000000001s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6228.660000000001s)]
*  It's a life problem. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6229.5s)]
*  And that life is lived in an environment, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6230.820000000001s)]
*  in a multigenational family, in a certain culture. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6233.660000000001s)]
*  Let's look at the whole thing. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6237.5s)]
*  That's all. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6239.660000000001s)]
*  I think we can start to head more in that direction, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6240.5s)]
*  or how do you think this changes? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6242.18s)]
*  Because we are pretty far down the well here. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6243.58s)]
*  Because sometimes you even said roar. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6249.18s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like our whole planet [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6250.98s)]
*  just wants to fucking roar. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6252.5s)]
*  It's like, I feel like everybody just wants to go [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6254.7s)]
*  in the yard and just scream at that sky. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6258.38s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6262.9s)]
*  it feels like there's just something trapped in us that is, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6264.3s)]
*  does that make any sense, man? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6268.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, and it's had some cultural expression as well. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6271.02s)]
*  What was that movie where somebody yells, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6274.18s)]
*  I'm fed up and I can't take it anymore, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6279.1s)]
*  and he starts yelling. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6281.22s)]
*  Oh, Falling Down? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6282.34s)]
*  Michael Douglas? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6283.38s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6284.22s)]
*  I don't know which movie it was, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6285.14s)]
*  but it was somebody just starts yelling, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6286.34s)]
*  I'm fed up and I can't take it anymore, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6288.9s)]
*  and everybody starts yelling, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6290.66s)]
*  I'm fed up, I can't take it anymore. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6291.62s)]
*  I think there's a deep sense of frustration in this culture. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6295.02s)]
*  I'm mad as hell, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6298.62s)]
*  and I'm not gonna be able to take this anymore. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6299.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's Network. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6300.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, Network. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6302.42s)]
*  That's a great movie. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6304.14s)]
*  If you've never seen it, it's a great movie. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6304.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm mad as hell and I'm holding it. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6306.38s)]
*  No, that was decades ago. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6307.5s)]
*  I think the level of frustration in our society [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6310.9800000000005s)]
*  has increased. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6314.06s)]
*  Why are people frustrated? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6315.5s)]
*  Because their needs aren't being met. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6316.82s)]
*  And that scream, look, I travel all over the world. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6318.86s)]
*  I just came back from a three week, six country tour [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6322.9800000000005s)]
*  of Europe. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6327.06s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6327.9s)]
*  12,000 people. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6329.38s)]
*  That sense of frustration, that sense of longing [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6330.94s)]
*  that we talked about, it's so universal these days. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6334.42s)]
*  It is. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6337.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6338.54s)]
*  Yeah, is it? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6339.38s)]
*  Because it feels like this, are other people feeling this? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6340.219999999999s)]
*  That's what I wonder a lot. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6343.3s)]
*  Are other people feeling this same way? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6344.26s)]
*  Well, some people are not because they escape [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6346.219999999999s)]
*  and this society is absolutely brilliant [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6351.42s)]
*  at creating escapes through mass media, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6356.18s)]
*  mass sports, consumption and so on. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6360.540000000001s)]
*  But I'll say something here. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6365.780000000001s)]
*  And this is particularly true of comedians I have found. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6368.860000000001s)]
*  Some people are just born more sensitive. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6373.5s)]
*  That's a great point too [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6376.18s)]
*  and I have to take that into account. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6377.18s)]
*  We all do. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6378.34s)]
*  And more sensitive means, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6379.18s)]
*  sensitive is one of the Latin words, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6381.5s)]
*  sincere to feel. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6382.9400000000005s)]
*  Some people are genetically born more sensitive. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6384.58s)]
*  They feel more. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6387.98s)]
*  That means when things go wrong, [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6389.22s)]
*  they feel it more than the others. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6390.94s)]
*  So the same thing can happen externally [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6393.22s)]
*  to different people, but if one of them is more sensitive, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6395.9s)]
*  they're gonna feel it all the more. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6399.58s)]
*  So it's especially the highly sensitive people [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6402.3s)]
*  who are feeling that scream that you talk about. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6405.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6411.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's what it's just like. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6413.22s)]
*  I just feel like we've just gone so far off the path of. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6415.900000000001s)]
*  But if I can say something, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6422.14s)]
*  your sense that we've gone off the path, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6425.26s)]
*  what in you knows that? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6429.18s)]
*  Like what part of me you mean? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6437.74s)]
*  What in you? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6439.9400000000005s)]
*  Who in you knows that we've gone off the path? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6441.179999999999s)]
*  It's the part that hasn't gone off the path. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6444.58s)]
*  It's the part that actually sees. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6447.379999999999s)]
*  So that I don't wanna create too much doom and gloom here. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6449.7s)]
*  There is this self here, there's this trueness here [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6453.98s)]
*  that's never been damaged, never been destroyed. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6457.299999999999s)]
*  There's no beast damaged goes that way. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6459.7s)]
*  It's always in here. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6461.62s)]
*  It's a question of can we connect with it? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6463.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6465.46s)]
*  Yeah, how do we get back to connecting [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6467.299999999999s)]
*  with that sort of thing? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6468.94s)]
*  Because our society, our culture is not gonna do it for us. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6469.78s)]
*  It doesn't feel like we might have to start with it [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6472.98s)]
*  as individuals. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6475.179999999999s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6476.179999999999s)]
*  We do begin as individuals, but you've probably realized, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6478.58s)]
*  I mean, just for example, in your AA group, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6482.58s)]
*  there's a community there. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6484.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6485.9s)]
*  Who have a lot of shared experiences [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6486.74s)]
*  and who are very vulnerable to be open [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6490.7s)]
*  and sharing their experiences. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6492.219999999999s)]
*  And that's a source of support. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6494.099999999999s)]
*  When you share about yourself, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6496.5s)]
*  that's a source of support to others. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6498.54s)]
*  When they share about themselves, that's support for you. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6500.1s)]
*  So that ultimately, no, we don't have to do it by ourselves. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6502.9s)]
*  It begins as an individual process, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6505.98s)]
*  but pretty soon you find that we're not alone. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6508.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6511.66s)]
*  Do you think we can get out of this toxic culture, Ebor? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6512.86s)]
*  Do you feel like there's a way out of where we are? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6517.14s)]
*  Or do you feel like that humanity is just... [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6520.26s)]
*  I believe in human beings. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6524.74s)]
*  That's a great statement. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6527.14s)]
*  I do too. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6528.820000000001s)]
*  I believe that there's an essential goodness there. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6529.66s)]
*  A desire to connect, a desire to belong, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6532.780000000001s)]
*  desire to celebrate life. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6536.02s)]
*  I think that's, we're endowed with those capacities. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6539.26s)]
*  And as difficult as things may look, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6542.38s)]
*  and especially these days with these terrible wars going on [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6544.9400000000005s)]
*  and the suffering that we've talked about, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6549.26s)]
*  I still believe that there's so many examples everywhere I go, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6552.02s)]
*  I meet such good people, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6556.42s)]
*  people are trying to make a difference, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6558.860000000001s)]
*  people are trying to do their little bit or their big bit, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6559.820000000001s)]
*  to reduce the suffering in the world, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6563.22s)]
*  to speak the truth, to offer some love, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6566.9400000000005s)]
*  compassion to the world. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6571.02s)]
*  I really do believe in humans. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6573.1s)]
*  No, we have the potential to be monsters. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6576.900000000001s)]
*  We have the potential to be angels. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6580.06s)]
*  But that good side never totally disappears. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6582.740000000001s)]
*  Some people discovered over so much [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6587.38s)]
*  that they might never get in touch with it. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6589.38s)]
*  Most people, I think, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6591.900000000001s)]
*  are quite capable of getting there [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6594.900000000001s)]
*  once they decide that they want to. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6597.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think... [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6599.62s)]
*  What scares me, I think, is that [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6602.3s)]
*  in order to be a human being, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6606.06s)]
*  we have to have the present moment, right? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6610.22s)]
*  We have to be able to [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6612.58s)]
*  still have the ability to reflect and recognize and think. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6616.1s)]
*  And our society, our culture, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6620.9400000000005s)]
*  has created a lot where we're so many distractions, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6624.22s)]
*  so that if we never even take the time, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6628.02s)]
*  if we can be distracted enough [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6630.18s)]
*  from being able to really think or feel, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6633.06s)]
*  feel really, probably, starting with feeling, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6637.62s)]
*  then we'll be trapped forever, in a way. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6640.66s)]
*  Well... [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6645.74s)]
*  Does that make sense at all? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6646.58s)]
*  It's interesting how you say all these [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6649.74s)]
*  really insightful things, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6651.94s)]
*  then you keep asking me if it makes sense. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6653.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6654.78s)]
*  Don't apologize. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6655.82s)]
*  I can't think and talk sometimes at the same time. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6656.86s)]
*  I can't feel and speak at the same... [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6658.94s)]
*  No, but I'm just telling you that. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6661.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6663.62s)]
*  I'm not criticizing, I'm just noticing something. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6664.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel like you are appreciated, thanks. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6666.58s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6668.94s)]
*  We're born as feeling creatures. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6671.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6673.66s)]
*  We feel before we think. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6674.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6676.0199999999995s)]
*  The feeling apparatus is present in us [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6676.86s)]
*  before we're even born. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6680.82s)]
*  The thinking apparatus doesn't start developing [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6682.82s)]
*  until much later on. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6685.46s)]
*  That's true. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6686.74s)]
*  So that if there's a scaffolding of healthy feelings, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6687.82s)]
*  then our thinking will be aligned with reality. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6692.98s)]
*  But it's the feelings that... [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6697.46s)]
*  We're feelings. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6699.9s)]
*  We're feeling creatures before we're thinking creatures. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6702.38s)]
*  Got it. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6705.1s)]
*  So what you said makes absolute sense [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6705.94s)]
*  from the... [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6708.22s)]
*  Even from the evolutionary and physiological point of view. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6709.34s)]
*  Like animals feel, but they don't necessarily think. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6712.66s)]
*  In fact, they don't think. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6715.18s)]
*  Some don't. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6717.18s)]
*  But without thinking, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6718.02s)]
*  without feeling, they wouldn't survive. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6721.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6723.06s)]
*  You know? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6723.9s)]
*  And we think we can get by our own thinking. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6725.0599999999995s)]
*  We got it backwards. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6728.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6729.38s)]
*  That's what it feels like these days. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6730.219999999999s)]
*  It feels like everybody's just thinking. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6732.139999999999s)]
*  Even with autonomous inventions and technology, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6734.26s)]
*  I'm like at a certain point, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6739.34s)]
*  I don't want any more technology if it's not helping us. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6741.9s)]
*  I know. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6745.0599999999995s)]
*  Like stop. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6745.9s)]
*  You're killing what it means to be me, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6748.0599999999995s)]
*  or not me as a human, but just us. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6750.26s)]
*  It feels like we don't need to get fast. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6752.62s)]
*  It's just like, you're going to take jobs away. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6755.74s)]
*  If a guy doesn't have a job, he doesn't have a purpose. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6757.86s)]
*  Having a job isn't only your purpose, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6759.74s)]
*  but it's what gives people some sense of purpose. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6762.66s)]
*  And a sense of meaning. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6765.38s)]
*  And a sense of meaning, right? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6766.54s)]
*  And once you don't feel like you have any of that, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6767.74s)]
*  then what are you? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6769.46s)]
*  It's like we're almost just... [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6770.3s)]
*  I don't understand why our society wants that. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6772.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, I totally get where you're coming from. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6775.38s)]
*  Because when we talk about AI, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6780.099999999999s)]
*  my mind glazes over. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6782.82s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6784.74s)]
*  I don't want one more piece of technology. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6786.18s)]
*  I'm much more interested in what happens with human beings. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6789.18s)]
*  A hundred. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6791.5s)]
*  Man, thank you, dude. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6792.7s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6793.58s)]
*  I just care how people feel, you know? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6795.1s)]
*  And I just like, I don't know. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6797.62s)]
*  And when you talk about meaning, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6800.62s)]
*  if you look at the [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6802.14s)]
*  diminishing lifespan of especially white American men, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6806.1s)]
*  it's that loss of meaning. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6813.3s)]
*  When they hollowed out the industrial heartland of America [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6815.14s)]
*  and they outsourced all the cheap labor [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6818.900000000001s)]
*  to other countries, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6822.860000000001s)]
*  well, you can see that from the profit motive, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6824.38s)]
*  it makes sense. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6827.22s)]
*  But from the point of view of human lives, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6829.06s)]
*  you just deprive people of the sense of meaning. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6831.78s)]
*  And that sense of meaning, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6836.22s)]
*  it's a psychologist of my mind calls dislocation, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6839.0199999999995s)]
*  is a major source of distress [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6842.58s)]
*  and a major source of [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6844.9s)]
*  self-harm and addiction. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6848.379999999999s)]
*  Well, I even think like it used to be, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6851.0599999999995s)]
*  and I say this many times, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6852.5s)]
*  but like somebody worked in your area [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6853.66s)]
*  and they worked at a factory and they made a table [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6857.339999999999s)]
*  and they brought it, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6860.179999999999s)]
*  and you even had one of the tables at your house [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6861.0199999999995s)]
*  and you were proud of your dad [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6862.98s)]
*  because he worked there and he made it. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6864.0599999999995s)]
*  And then, but now you have somebody in another country [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6866.14s)]
*  mailing something over here, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6869.18s)]
*  they don't care about it that they're making it. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6871.02s)]
*  Their kids don't know even what they do probably. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6873.26s)]
*  Like where is the victor? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6878.54s)]
*  I don't understand what level of this we're gonna get to [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6880.22s)]
*  that is healthy. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6883.54s)]
*  Well, I think now what we're talking about here [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6886.1s)]
*  is the good old profit motive [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6888.62s)]
*  because profits don't care about human values [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6891.62s)]
*  and most companies, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6895.58s)]
*  that's what they're interested in [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6900.18s)]
*  is what will maximize profits. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6901.5s)]
*  And if they have to throw a thousand people [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6903.58s)]
*  out of a job in some town, they'll do it. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6905.22s)]
*  I don't understand that though. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6910.06s)]
*  Well, work I think is very important to people. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6912.22s)]
*  I mean, we're creatures who work. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6914.42s)]
*  I just read a really interesting book by the way. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6916.820000000001s)]
*  It's called The Continuum Concept, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6918.860000000001s)]
*  published 40 years ago or so. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6922.3s)]
*  This woman goes to the Venezuelan jungle, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6924.34s)]
*  six weeks away from civilization. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6929.1s)]
*  And she watches how these stone-aged people [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6931.74s)]
*  bring up their kids. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6934.34s)]
*  That's the book right there, The Continuum Concept. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6936.06s)]
*  How they bring up their kids, [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6938.42s)]
*  well, they hold them everywhere like we said, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6939.78s)]
*  they don't punish them, they don't yell at them. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6941.54s)]
*  These kids are growing up really happy [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6943.38s)]
*  and comfortable with themselves. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6945.02s)]
*  But the point I'm making is this tribe, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6946.7s)]
*  they don't have a word for work. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6950.7s)]
*  They have a word for cutting wood. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6953.14s)]
*  They have a word for planting. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6955.5s)]
*  They have a word for fishing. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6957.06s)]
*  They have a word for washing. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6958.740000000001s)]
*  But there's no word for work. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6962.02s)]
*  In other words, they just do what they do. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6963.14s)]
*  But there's no alienation from it. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6965.54s)]
*  Whatever they're into, they're just into it. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6968.740000000001s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6971.54s)]
*  But their only kid is not, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6972.740000000001s)]
*  here we talk about work-life balance. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6973.740000000001s)]
*  Now look at that phrase. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6976.860000000001s)]
*  What does that imply? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6978.22s)]
*  That here's life and here's work. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6979.820000000001s)]
*  And the two are not the same. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6983.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6985.38s)]
*  It's almost like we enslaved ourselves. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6986.660000000001s)]
*  Well, we have. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6988.9800000000005s)]
*  And then also our society, as you're saying, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6990.780000000001s)]
*  creates so much stress and uncomfortable [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6992.900000000001s)]
*  because say if you took something [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6994.780000000001s)]
*  that's supposed to be somewhere [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=6998.34s)]
*  and you put it somewhere else, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7001.54s)]
*  it's gonna always feel stressed [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7003.34s)]
*  because it's not in its home, right? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7005.02s)]
*  It's not in its natural spot. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7007.14s)]
*  Funny you should say that because I often say, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7009.34s)]
*  you can study a zebra [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7013.3s)]
*  and you could conclude that the zebra is an animal [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7015.3s)]
*  that mostly lies around all day, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7017.780000000001s)]
*  gets up a few times to eat or to defecate or something, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7019.780000000001s)]
*  and then lies down again, walks around a little bit. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7023.820000000001s)]
*  And it would be true if you observed a zebra [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7026.3s)]
*  in a zoo in a cage. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7028.820000000001s)]
*  But if you observed a zebra out there on a savanna [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7031.38s)]
*  or wherever she lives, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7034.740000000001s)]
*  you'd see a totally different creature. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7036.34s)]
*  Other turnt out there. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7037.9400000000005s)]
*  And the human being is in a sense, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7039.14s)]
*  we put ourselves into a zoo. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7041.94s)]
*  We're so far away from our natural revolution [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7045.46s)]
*  and environment. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7047.46s)]
*  It's not a question again of going back to Stone Age, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7048.5s)]
*  but it's a question of recognizing what we've lost. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7051.78s)]
*  In a certain sense, we've put ourselves into a zoo [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7054.58s)]
*  and we're studying ourselves totally out of our elements. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7058.419999999999s)]
*  And then we're wondering, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7062.94s)]
*  how come things are going so badly? [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7063.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7065.54s)]
*  It's almost, and I hate to even laugh at it, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7068.22s)]
*  but you're saying it's absurd. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7070.3s)]
*  It's absurd. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7072.06s)]
*  We're literally living in a theater of the absurd. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7072.900000000001s)]
*  In your book, you also talk about the history of humanity. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7077.38s)]
*  That what we call civilization is less than 5% [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7079.9400000000005s)]
*  of our existence as a species. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7083.9800000000005s)]
*  That for the entire span of the human genus, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7086.5s)]
*  that it represents less than 1% of that time. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7089.46s)]
*  Like our civilization. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7093.86s)]
*  Like our civilization. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7095.7s)]
*  We're such a small piece of how long humans have been alive. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7097.3s)]
*  And we have learned that such groups a long time ago [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7101.66s)]
*  held values emphasizing hospitality, sharing, generosity, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7105.3s)]
*  and reciprocal exchange for the purpose [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7108.860000000001s)]
*  not of personal enrichment, but of connection. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7110.820000000001s)]
*  These values were intelligent, time-tested guidelines [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7114.1s)]
*  for mutual survival. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7116.7s)]
*  Yes, there was violence and bad behavior and all the rest. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7119.74s)]
*  We have never been perfect. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7122.34s)]
*  But we knew something about setting the collective context [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7125.54s)]
*  for our humanist to flourish fruitfully. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7128.42s)]
*  That it was a group effort. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7131.22s)]
*  It was a group thing and people never saw themselves [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7132.7s)]
*  as separate from the environment or from animals [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7134.900000000001s)]
*  or from other human beings. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7138.18s)]
*  And in British Columbia, excuse me where I live, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7139.820000000001s)]
*  the indigenous people used to have a ceremony [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7145.900000000001s)]
*  called a potlatch. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7149.5s)]
*  And the potlatch is they would invite all these people, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7151.26s)]
*  neighbors and other tribes and so on. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7153.46s)]
*  And they'd give things to each other. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7157.06s)]
*  So it wasn't about getting, it was about giving. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7160.26s)]
*  When the British Colonialists arrived, you know what they did? [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7164.3s)]
*  They outlawed the potlatch. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7167.54s)]
*  Because they wanted to kill that spirit of communality [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7170.3s)]
*  that the indigenous people thrived on. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7174.62s)]
*  So they knew how to do it. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7177.1s)]
*  So they forbade a lot of the practices [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7178.14s)]
*  that gave the indigenous people meaning, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7181.78s)]
*  including the giving. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7184.0199999999995s)]
*  And until very recently, decades ago, it was outlawed. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7186.34s)]
*  So people had to do stuff in secret. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7191.62s)]
*  They outlawed the chanting. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7194.66s)]
*  They had to chant in secret. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7197.82s)]
*  Because they knew the healing power of the chants. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7203.26s)]
*  And the chants really connected indigenous people [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7208.179999999999s)]
*  to their traditions. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7210.22s)]
*  Now the Colonies did this everywhere. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7212.38s)]
*  They did this in the United States, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7214.58s)]
*  they did it in Australia and New Zealand. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7216.5s)]
*  They did it in Canada, of course, parts of Africa. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7219.38s)]
*  And so that a real effort was made to divorce people [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7224.42s)]
*  from their essential communal drives. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7228.7s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what it feels like. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7233.34s)]
*  That's what it feels like inside. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7235.62s)]
*  Like we're not supposed to be doing this. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7238.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7241.42s)]
*  You know? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7242.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7243.1s)]
*  One woman that you mentioned, Darcia Narvaez. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7243.94s)]
*  Yeah, Darcia Narvaez. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7246.9s)]
*  Darcia Narvaez. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7248.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7249.46s)]
*  Said that we have become species atypical. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7250.3s)]
*  A sobering idea when you think about it. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7253.94s)]
*  No other species has ever had the ability [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7255.66s)]
*  to be untrue to itself. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7258.1s)]
*  To forsake its own needs and never mind to convince itself [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7259.82s)]
*  that such is the way things ought to be. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7263.099999999999s)]
*  Or to destroy its own environment. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7265.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7267.3s)]
*  You know? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7268.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I still wonder if Mother Nature's mad about [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7268.98s)]
*  if some of the diseases we have now are because of [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7270.78s)]
*  what happened to the indigenous cultures. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7273.3s)]
*  If some of that just like, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7275.42s)]
*  is like, you know, because Mother Nature remembers. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7277.099999999999s)]
*  And so it's like, are we still just suffering the sins [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7280.54s)]
*  of what's happened a long time ago? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7284.0199999999995s)]
*  We are. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7286.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7287.26s)]
*  And the problem is, we haven't learned from it yet. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7288.1s)]
*  Like actually, I work a lot with indigenous people [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7292.1s)]
*  in Canada. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7295.14s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7295.9800000000005s)]
*  They often invite me to talk about addiction [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7296.82s)]
*  and stress and trauma and so on. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7298.58s)]
*  Well, some of them, we did a show in Vancouver, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7300.5s)]
*  some of them came out to the show. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7302.42s)]
*  Did they? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7304.02s)]
*  And they gave me some gifts. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7304.86s)]
*  Oh, fantastic. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7305.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, really beautiful. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7306.74s)]
*  Beautiful, isn't it? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7308.02s)]
*  Yeah, it was awesome, man. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7308.86s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7310.46s)]
*  It was really, really, really, really, really, really, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7311.3s)]
*  really, really, really, really, really, really, really, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7313.5s)]
*  really nice of them. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7316.34s)]
*  But, but, so I do a lot of that work, [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7317.38s)]
*  but I get so much from it, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7325.02s)]
*  because they have such deep wisdom. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7327.42s)]
*  Like even with all their trauma and all the dysfunction, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7329.18s)]
*  all the addiction and mental illness amongst them, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7332.9400000000005s)]
*  which is strictly a result of colonial trauma, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7336.700000000001s)]
*  but there's still such gentle wisdom, [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7340.620000000001s)]
*  there's still such connection. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7343.18s)]
*  I remember doing a ceremony with them, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7345.14s)]
*  some indigenous friends, two years ago, out in nature, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7348.620000000001s)]
*  they talked to every plant. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7354.26s)]
*  They're so connected, such deep wisdom. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7356.58s)]
*  And I actually believe that when this society [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7359.740000000001s)]
*  starts getting its head screwed on right, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7365.02s)]
*  we'll be very humbly willing to learn [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7368.06s)]
*  from the indigenous people. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7369.660000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7370.900000000001s)]
*  Like, yes, civilization has brought many amazing things, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7372.06s)]
*  not to forget that, but what if we could meld [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7377.26s)]
*  our technological know-how and scientific brilliance [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7382.700000000001s)]
*  with indigenous wisdom? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7387.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7388.740000000001s)]
*  What a world we could actually create. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7389.580000000001s)]
*  And maybe that is where we're headed, right? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7390.740000000001s)]
*  I think that has to be the hope. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7392.46s)]
*  Well, that's, I believe that's certainly a possibility. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7394.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think that has to be the hope that we take away. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7399.1s)]
*  Yeah, because if I were ever a leader, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7402.9800000000005s)]
*  I think we would get back to some of the things [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7404.820000000001s)]
*  that were important, you know? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7407.34s)]
*  You know, one of my favorite times when I was a kid, [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7408.700000000001s)]
*  the power would go out sometimes. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7410.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7412.18s)]
*  And so we'd all have to, like, mom would put [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7413.02s)]
*  a couple candles out, and so we'd all have [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7414.42s)]
*  to be right there. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7415.820000000001s)]
*  Together. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7416.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it was just like, I don't know, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7417.5s)]
*  all that mattered was just like, like you could joke, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7420.34s)]
*  but it was like, I don't know, like, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7424.06s)]
*  we just all needed each other, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7428.5s)]
*  you need to know where everybody was, everybody here. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7429.700000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's the hope, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7432.98s)]
*  is that we all need to be successful about that. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7434.459999999999s)]
*  Well, you can see it even now, [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7436.94s)]
*  when there's disasters, people really come together. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7438.82s)]
*  They tend to come together to support each other. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7443.379999999999s)]
*  They'll go out of their way to give and to support. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7446.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, for sure, you see it with the flooding [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7451.0199999999995s)]
*  and stuff in the southeast right now. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7452.74s)]
*  Many places all over the world. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7454.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7455.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's so much to learn from our natives, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7456.7s)]
*  from the indigenous people of the land, you know? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7458.98s)]
*  Darsha Narva, the scientist, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7462.9s)]
*  or the psychologist that you mentioned, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7465.0199999999995s)]
*  she's written a book called The Evolved Nest, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7467.0199999999995s)]
*  and she's talking about our commonality with other animals [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7470.259999999999s)]
*  and how they rear their young [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7474.7s)]
*  and what we could learn from them. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7477.299999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7478.58s)]
*  That's an amazing little book. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7480.299999999999s)]
*  I wrote the foreword for it. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7482.179999999999s)]
*  Darsha's done some amazing work [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7485.74s)]
*  on the actual needs of human beings. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7487.379999999999s)]
*  Really, she's a pretty fascinating woman? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7490.0599999999995s)]
*  Which is very interesting, very interesting. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7492.22s)]
*  If you ever want to talk to her, I'm happy to connect you. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7494.62s)]
*  That would be really cool. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7496.42s)]
*  You Canadians are dang interesting, man. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7497.38s)]
*  Well, Darsha is American. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7499.3s)]
*  Oh, she is? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7500.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7501.42s)]
*  All right, we'll take it. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7502.26s)]
*  No, no, she's a retired professor [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7503.08s)]
*  at the University of Notre Dame. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7506.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7508.22s)]
*  And she's still very active. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7509.0599999999995s)]
*  And this book is called The Evolved Nest. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7510.66s)]
*  It's just a slim little volume. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7513.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7514.3s)]
*  But you should learn about how penguins [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7515.14s)]
*  bring up their kids or wolves. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7516.86s)]
*  When a mother dies, then wolves [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7522.58s)]
*  who haven't even been pregnant start lactating [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7525.98s)]
*  to feed the young ones. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7530.18s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7531.42s)]
*  You know, and how? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7532.42s)]
*  When the baby elephant is born, you know what happens? [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7533.82s)]
*  All the other mothers. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7536.7s)]
*  All the elephants put their trunks on it. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7537.54s)]
*  Yeah, all the other mothers, you know, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7539.38s)]
*  they stand around, they touch the baby. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7540.74s)]
*  They know the need for touch. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7543.22s)]
*  I mean, there's incredible wisdom in animals as well. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7545.14s)]
*  And Dasha and her writing partner, Gay Bracho, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7548.86s)]
*  they really show us the lessons we could actually derive [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7553.86s)]
*  just from watching our animals bring up their young. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7558.34s)]
*  We still have a lot to learn. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7561.82s)]
*  Is that the best message to take away from your book, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7562.98s)]
*  do you think? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7565.1s)]
*  We still have a lot to learn and we need to be humble. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7566.38s)]
*  We need to realize that for all our achievements [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7569.7s)]
*  and our intellectual brilliance, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7573.0199999999995s)]
*  we've come disconnected from our hearts, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7575.26s)]
*  from our gut feelings, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7577.54s)]
*  and that we need to really be curious about what our hearts [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7579.26s)]
*  and our guts are telling us, not just our intellects. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7583.18s)]
*  Amen. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7586.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7587.42s)]
*  We need an emotional revolution. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7588.34s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7592.5s)]
*  Before you go, and thank you so much for your time. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7595.26s)]
*  My pleasure. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7598.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7599.06s)]
*  There's a part, Rafi, there's a guy in the book, Rafi. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7600.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, Rafi. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7604.22s)]
*  Rafi. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7605.06s)]
*  No, Rafi's a children's singer. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7605.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, that guy. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7608.3s)]
*  That's him. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7609.26s)]
*  I'd like to be him under the sea. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7610.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7613.1s)]
*  Is that him? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7613.9400000000005s)]
*  No, that's Ringo Starr. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7614.78s)]
*  Oh. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7615.9s)]
*  You're singing Octopus's Garden. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7616.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7618.14s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7618.9800000000005s)]
*  But Rafi used to sing Baby, Beluga. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7619.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7621.82s)]
*  You know? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7622.66s)]
*  Apple, Zamba, no, no. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7623.5s)]
*  Is that song? [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7624.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7625.78s)]
*  Banana phone. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7626.62s)]
*  But he says we discover who we are from the inside. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7627.46s)]
*  You wrote that on your book. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7630.42s)]
*  And Rafi actually played in the White House [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7631.5s)]
*  at the Clinton inauguration. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7635.66s)]
*  Oh, sweet. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7638.9400000000005s)]
*  And he's like the children's troubadour of the world. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7639.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, when I was a child, we listened to, yes, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7642.1s)]
*  they had all of it. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7644.54s)]
*  So Rafi's a friend of mine. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7646.34s)]
*  Oh, excellent. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7647.7s)]
*  And at some point, some years ago, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7648.54s)]
*  he wakes up in the middle of the night, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7652.34s)]
*  and the world, child honoring comes into his head. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7655.9800000000005s)]
*  And he says, what would the world look like [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7659.7s)]
*  if we honored children and the needs of children? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7661.9400000000005s)]
*  So he started this child honoring institute. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7665.74s)]
*  Now the thing about his singing for children [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7669.58s)]
*  is it's not condescending. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7673.06s)]
*  He really plays with kids and really gets them. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7675.54s)]
*  And his heart is really so childlike. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7679.34s)]
*  So he says, whatever the quote was, that we... [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7684.74s)]
*  We discover who we are from the inside. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7691.3s)]
*  We discover who we are from the inside. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7693.14s)]
*  And he's actually talking about how human beings develop, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7694.78s)]
*  which is through our feelings first. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7697.7s)]
*  And those feelings begin in the uterus. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7699.86s)]
*  So already when a mother is stressed, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7703.099999999999s)]
*  the child already feels that in the uterus. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7705.38s)]
*  And that stresses the child, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7708.0599999999995s)]
*  and that interferes with the child's brain development. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7709.98s)]
*  So that actually we develop our sense [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7712.42s)]
*  from our feelings first. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7716.78s)]
*  And as I said earlier, then the intellect comes in. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7718.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7722.26s)]
*  But if the emotional circuits are out of balance [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7723.42s)]
*  because of early stress, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7728.46s)]
*  then it's hard for us to even think straight. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7730.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7732.42s)]
*  And our society we have is women. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7733.34s)]
*  So many mothers have to work. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7735.82s)]
*  It's like we've just, yeah, we're a little misconstrued. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7737.46s)]
*  Well, the United States, 25% of women [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7741.9800000000005s)]
*  have to go back to work within two weeks of giving birth. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7745.9400000000005s)]
*  And what nature would prefer scientifically [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7749.26s)]
*  and physiologically is for the baby with the mother [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7753.66s)]
*  for at least nine months. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7756.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7758.46s)]
*  But actually for years. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7759.3s)]
*  No. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7760.5s)]
*  Or if not the mother, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7762.9400000000005s)]
*  but at least with the mother for at least nine months, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7766.900000000001s)]
*  but ideally well beyond that, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7768.900000000001s)]
*  but with other nurturing adults. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7772.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7774.58s)]
*  So it's not just caregivers who give you food and. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7775.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7779.3s)]
*  It's the mother, the grandmother, the aunt, the neighbor, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7780.139999999999s)]
*  the sense of community, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7781.54s)]
*  your whole genes being right there. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7782.38s)]
*  Like. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7784.259999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7785.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7785.94s)]
*  How did we get off on such a different tangent then? [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7786.78s)]
*  If we were supposed to be in these tribes, these groups, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7789.54s)]
*  these, it's just evolution [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7794.86s)]
*  and there's nothing we can do about it? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7796.46s)]
*  Well, that's, you know, that's civilization. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7798.3s)]
*  Right, civilization. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7802.94s)]
*  Which has obviously brought all kinds of benefits, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7804.0599999999995s)]
*  but also look at all that we've lost. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7807.26s)]
*  So again, it's for me, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7810.22s)]
*  can we value our achievements and our knowledge [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7814.14s)]
*  and try to remember what we've lost [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7820.5s)]
*  and try and reconnect with those parts of ourselves [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7823.5s)]
*  that we've kind of got divorced from. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7826.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7829.14s)]
*  Yeah, and when you, yeah, and your children, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7831.38s)]
*  just look into them, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7833.06s)]
*  pour into them what you want out of them, you know? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7833.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7836.42s)]
*  And you can talk to them as much as you can. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7838.24s)]
*  And yes, some, some, you, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7840.08s)]
*  kids don't know how to feel sometimes, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7842.5199999999995s)]
*  so you have to also talk to them about their feelings. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7844.0s)]
*  No, you don't. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7846.599999999999s)]
*  They know exactly how to feel. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7848.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't have the words for, so you, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7850.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7852.8s)]
*  They know how to feel. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7853.639999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7854.48s)]
*  It's our job to give them words for their feelings. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7855.32s)]
*  Right, it's our job to give them words for their feelings. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7857.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7860.12s)]
*  So yeah, if you're a child, if you're not doing that, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7860.96s)]
*  it's not a judgment, and I don't have any children, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7863.0s)]
*  but when I was young, it was like, how do you feel? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7865.88s)]
*  Let me help you with this. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7868.56s)]
*  Oh, not even how you feel. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7870.0s)]
*  You're really angry with daddy right now, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7872.0s)]
*  because you wanted a cookie before dinner, [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7873.68s)]
*  and daddy said, no cookie. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7875.4800000000005s)]
*  So now you're really angry, aren't you? [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7876.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7878.28s)]
*  You know, so it's not even, [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7879.12s)]
*  we don't have to tell them how to feel. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7881.32s)]
*  They're feeling creatures. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7882.6s)]
*  We have to accept their feelings. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7884.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7885.8s)]
*  That doesn't mean we give them the cookie. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7886.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7887.96s)]
*  But it means that we do understand why. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7889.360000000001s)]
*  Hey, I understand you want that cookie. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7891.96s)]
*  Yeah, right now you're really mad at daddy. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7893.8s)]
*  Okay, I get it. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7896.84s)]
*  I get it. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7898.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know, that's all. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7899.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7900.400000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean you're allowed to hate your brother, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7901.400000000001s)]
*  but I get that you're angry. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7906.64s)]
*  So we're not talking about permissive parenting. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7907.92s)]
*  We're talking about authoritative parenting, [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7913.2s)]
*  not authoritarian, authoritative, [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7915.64s)]
*  where the child is understood and held and guided, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7918.320000000001s)]
*  and we give them words for their feelings, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7921.68s)]
*  but we don't ask them to suppress themselves. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7924.16s)]
*  We may not accept certain behaviors or put limits. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7927.4800000000005s)]
*  We'll be in the order to do that. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7931.04s)]
*  If the child trusts you and is looking to you, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7932.200000000001s)]
*  like natives, the indigenous people, [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7935.4400000000005s)]
*  like we said earlier, never hit their kids, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7937.88s)]
*  because the kids trusted the adults for guidance. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7941.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7943.360000000001s)]
*  So, which all comes from connection. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7945.6s)]
*  100%. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7948.16s)]
*  And now we're learning so many things. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7949.360000000001s)]
*  We learn them like, you know, through a YouTube video [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7950.92s)]
*  or through, we learn, I mean, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7954.36s)]
*  now most people learn about sex through pornography. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7956.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just like, yeah. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7958.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we need each other to, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7961.76s)]
*  yeah, we need each other. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7967.08s)]
*  And we're creating more and more that we don't. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7969.0s)]
*  That's right. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7972.6s)]
*  And we're creating more and more [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7973.4400000000005s)]
*  that if you have needs, there's something wrong with you. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7976.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7978.96s)]
*  If you have emotional needs, you're weakling, you know. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7979.8s)]
*  Oh, one day our feelings will be in a museum. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7983.76s)]
*  You'll go visit them there. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7985.6s)]
*  Like, hey, remember this? [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7986.56s)]
*  They used to have that. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7988.2s)]
*  Dr. Monte, thank you just for putting all this together. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7991.0s)]
*  It's really fascinating. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7994.400000000001s)]
*  You, I mean, you have so many [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=7995.24s)]
*  other like therapists and scientists and philosophers [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8000.28s)]
*  and doctors and everything that you've quoted in here [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8005.28s)]
*  to really put together a beautiful piece of work here. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8008.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8011.04s)]
*  It's really fascinating. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8011.88s)]
*  And it's not all like Debbie Downer stuff either. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8012.72s)]
*  And I don't mean to be, [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8015.4800000000005s)]
*  and I don't think we were that much in this conversation. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8016.64s)]
*  It's just looking at things and saying, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8018.400000000001s)]
*  hey, well, let's take a look at where we are possibly. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8020.64s)]
*  How did we get here? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8023.92s)]
*  Well, that's my intention. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8024.96s)]
*  And my intention is to promote healing, actually. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8026.0s)]
*  It's not just to spread doom and gloom. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8028.6s)]
*  And actually the healing part of the book [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8030.16s)]
*  is the longest part of the book. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8032.64s)]
*  I'm not there yet. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8034.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but yeah, yeah. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8034.88s)]
*  I hope you get there someday. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8036.4800000000005s)]
*  I think I will. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8039.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8040.16s)]
*  I've been reading it, a good clip. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8041.0s)]
*  I'm enjoying it. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8041.84s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to hear that. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8042.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8043.52s)]
*  It was, if I can boast, can I boast? [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8044.360000000001s)]
*  Sure, I would love for you to. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8046.360000000001s)]
*  It was 19 weeks on the New York Times bestseller's list. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8047.68s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8050.52s)]
*  For a year and a half, it was a Canadian bestseller. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8051.360000000001s)]
*  It's been published in 41 languages now internationally. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8053.16s)]
*  And it's been a bestseller in a whole lot of countries. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8056.8s)]
*  So I think there's value in this book. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8058.92s)]
*  Well, I think also that it's good to know [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8060.72s)]
*  that enough people are starting to, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8062.52s)]
*  are recognizing some of the same thought, you know? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8065.28s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8068.12s)]
*  Because that in itself, those numbers itself, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8068.96s)]
*  and that prolificness is a source of hope, I think. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8070.84s)]
*  I think what's happening actually is that [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8075.5599999999995s)]
*  as society in some ways goes more into crisis, [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8077.88s)]
*  also more and more people are waking up. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8082.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8084.12s)]
*  And they're still not asking questions. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8084.96s)]
*  And I see that as a good thing. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8086.12s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8087.4s)]
*  Thank you for letting me ask you questions today. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8089.04s)]
*  Thank you for, yeah, just for your time. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8091.88s)]
*  So many of my friends love you and look up to you. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8095.08s)]
*  I had my own therapist was like, he's asking, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8097.56s)]
*  I'm like, well, you're my therapist. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8101.400000000001s)]
*  But he was excited that I was getting this now with you. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8104.0s)]
*  So, yeah, thank you so much for your commitment [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8105.88s)]
*  to curiosity. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8109.240000000001s)]
*  And thanks for your time. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8110.8s)]
*  Now I'm just floating on the breeze [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8112.56s)]
*  and I feel I'm falling like these leaves. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8115.160000000001s)]
*  I must be cornerstone. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8118.08s)]
*  Ooh. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8121.56s)]
*  But when I reach that ground, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8124.16s)]
*  I'll share this piece of mind I found. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8126.04s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8128.839999999999s)]
*  But it's gonna take. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlepoi1TNE&t=8133.5199999999995s)]
