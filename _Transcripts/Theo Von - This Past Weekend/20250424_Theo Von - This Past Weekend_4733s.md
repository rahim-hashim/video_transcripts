*  It's hard to tell cuz that you know you see some people like [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=51.96s)]
*  doing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=55.2s)]
*  Crazy looking things and you think like that looks crazy. Why are you trying to look 18 years old? You know what I mean? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=56.28s)]
*  Oh, like I was on a celebrity big brother right now. Who's that guy? He kind of looks like Jack Sparrow [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=61.24s)]
*  I don't know you talking about but I can imagine a lot [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=66.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? You kind of can look like a loo [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=69.68s)]
*  I think you can go one of two ways like if you see yourself all the time and especially if like the way you make [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=72.38s)]
*  A living is by kind of impart the way you look or whatever it feels like you know people can get like obsessed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=79.04s)]
*  With it you know what I mean? Yeah, that's kind of what I think I'm Mickey Rourke. I think yeah [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=86.16s)]

*  Conundrum with yourself because you have to get old to you you would constantly be feeling [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=100.12s)]
*  Like afraid to get older. I guess or you'd be in like in a yeah [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=105.17999999999999s)]

*  Nobody wants to get older right because what it means is like you're gonna die and nobody wants to really face [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=110.75999999999999s)]

*  You know so you start to get a little bit that that can kind of affect you and I think if you I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=135.26s)]
*  Think part of it's you got to just get comfortable with the fact that you know and I guess I'm lucky cuz I'm I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=140.06s)]

*  I'm alright with that and also kind of what I what I like what I'm interested in more and more is stuff that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=151.42s)]
*  Doesn't necessarily involve like how I look like that pressure. I think like for women [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  I from it for anybody who's sees himself all the time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=162.38s)]
*  It's like I think that can turn into like a vicious cycle of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=166.04s)]
*  Trying to look at shit and fix it or look younger or something [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=171.36s)]
*  Whereas like you don't have to look any kind of way to direct movies. You know what I mean or have a business [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=175.0s)]
*  You know so I guess I'm lucky. I love me. Do you it's hard to know if you it would seem like you seem like a guy who? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=179.72s)]

*  There's always like a lot of this like so we were like you don't like being in a crowd [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=257.14s)]

*  And then we'll get off this I want to talk [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=279.26000000000005s)]
*  I know you I want to talk to you about directing and acting but [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=281.3s)]
*  Because yeah, I was just I was like this bit [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=284.3s)]
*  It's so because they always get pictures you where you seem like you're like the the dwarf that like is kind of like the backup dwarf [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=286.1s)]
*  You know like you're on the side. You're smoky like what is that guy? I didn't I don't know that character [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=292.26000000000005s)]

*  I shouldn't say anything, but it was like um [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't know they all and it's like they only put this chronology out of you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  And that makes you seem like you're kind of bummed well. Here's the thing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  If the only time like when somebody's taking a picture of me. Yeah, I'm bummed because usually I'm with my kids [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=316.34s)]
*  I'm trying to go somewhere, and then there's four guys. We're like [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=323.18s)]
*  And I'm like hey man every time can you give me some time? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=325.7s)]
*  I'm trying to be with my kids. I'm she do you mind [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=328.38s)]
*  Can you you know what I mean? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=330.3s)]
*  So the look on your face is kind of like and then they go away not taking the picture you go inside and you're having [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=331.26s)]
*  A good time, but it's this selective experience of like take a picture of somebody every time. They're feeling irritated [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=335.94s)]
*  They're gonna look irritated [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=341.54s)]
*  Especially if you're the one irritating them yeah [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  It's like I'll come piss you off and then take your bigger than put and then be like look up [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=345.98s)]
*  Right that's exactly what that's exactly what that whole system is really right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=350.7s)]
*  But and it's like useful because that's why like you know [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=355.3s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen on all the stuff like the you know [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  It's kind of the idea is like fall somebody around antagonize them right and hopefully [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=359.86s)]
*  They'll have like a nervous breakdown and go crazy on you and then your video be worth more money [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  You know yes, it's such a it's that whole thing gets really black mirrorish man. You know it really gets kind of like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  Like I can remember a long time ago. You know [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  Years years ago like I really had a lot of empathy for Britney Spears because I remember that it seemed like [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=380.54s)]
*  That's not somebody that I I knew or hung out with but I just like everybody else you see all this shit that comes [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=386.3s)]
*  Through and I but having had my own experiences myself [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=392.06s)]
*  I knew like these are people are following her around in a time where she may or may not have been having difficulty [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=395.04s)]
*  I don't know because I don't know her [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=402.5s)]
*  But I do know [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=403.78s)]
*  That the the cycle of having people harangue and yell at you and hassle you and follow you it kind of seemed like that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=405.1s)]
*  Itself was kind of whipping up the whole thing into a tizzy, so it's it's like they're not helping [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=411.38s)]
*  Well, yeah, and they're kind of poking a stick and go look look at it [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=416.86s)]
*  You look and you it's a it that's where it felt kind of like that's the first time [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=420.98s)]
*  I thought this is kind of a weird kind of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=424.74s)]
*  unintentional I think culturally but kind of collective cruelty where [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=428.94s)]
*  What's taken out of the image that you see are the people around right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=433.1s)]
*  You know waving the stick at the tiger or poking on it or whatever [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  And you all you see is the the growling animal whatever it is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  But like that a part of that is because somebody come around and you know hitting on or whatever to make it get active [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's where you think okay. Well, this isn't really news. It's not even real. It's not what would be happening if this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  Effect wasn't taking place. Yeah, and and that's where I thought okay [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  You know the sort of wise thing to do is to just sort of like maintain one's perspective and try to remove yourself a little [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Bit it doesn't which is what I would like to do [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=469.88000000000005s)]
*  I think there's this sense that like that like if you see someone's picture all time [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  They must want you to be seeing right right which is not the case at all for me. I'm self-conscious [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=476.86s)]
*  I don't really want you to be seeing that I don't see any reason for it as an actor [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  It's no good for you because I don't really want people if they watch a movie to be like that's not him because I saw him [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=486.26s)]
*  Yesterday lunch, and I know he's who he really is it gets in the way of you being able to create like the illusion [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  It's really hard work to create the illusion that this person like the character in the accountant to for example is a real person [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=498.94s)]
*  in a real circumstance in order to get the audience to care about it to laugh to find it exciting and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=506.58s)]
*  Empathize the character they have to suspend disbelief. That's harder if you're constantly being shown something else [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=512.06s)]
*  So I think it it gets in the way it makes it harder to be an actor [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=518.54s)]
*  And it's also just it's also not good for you people start to resent you if they see you too much no matter [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=522.0s)]
*  Whether or not you're trying to be so you know I don't want to do this and nonetheless like I remember [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=528.5799999999999s)]
*  20 years ago going through an experience was like it feels to the world like I'm trying to shove myself in their face and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=534.1s)]
*  Nobody likes that right nobody wants to be the like you the the camera hog the guy was trying to get a bunch of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=540.98s)]
*  Ben Affleck shoes or whatever [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=546.86s)]
*  Me alone, and I'd be I would be much happier so in a way it also [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=549.22s)]
*  Can damage your career although? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=553.98s)]
*  I think it's I don't pretend to understand the nuances and the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=555.82s)]
*  Social media and how to manage that as celebrities why don't do it some people do it really well [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=560.34s)]
*  but and I think there is a difference now because like [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=565.34s)]
*  It's like if you have a hundred million followers, that's actually [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=568.54s)]
*  Valuable and meaningful in a different way. I still I'm kind of old school. I guess in a way of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=572.5s)]
*  Medium school I think I'm middle school yes, I am a seventh grader [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=578.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=583.02s)]
*  Dude, yeah, I don't think I don't know if I graduated that when someone they let you skip [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=584.26s)]
*  I guess if you're you know depending on what county you're in but they hold you back [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  Oh [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=591.92s)]
*  Bro the scariest thing was when like the dumb bully kid got held back [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  And you're like you had to stick around in your grade and you like bro [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  I remember we got word six ten and in like sixth grade [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=601.4s)]
*  Dude, we got word that Damien had gotten held back and people were like oh [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  Hell no, dude. We cannot do Damien [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=611.68s)]
*  Me back to we cannot do Damien again like Damien has to go out to pasture wherever they put these kids that leave sixth grade [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=615.24s)]
*  And they're like Damien's coming finish their education [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=622.44s)]
*  Shut him down dude tase him or something [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  You know put a tire spike when he's leaving out of his driveway in the morning, but Damien cannot come back [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=630.48s)]
*  But yeah, it is interesting and it is kind of a sickness [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=637.32s)]
*  I think a lot of people see that stuff as a sickness these days [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=639.6s)]
*  But I do think it's fascinating about the suspension of disbelief and that that was something that used to be amazing about [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=642.16s)]
*  Celebrities is like you never got to see them, right? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=648.72s)]
*  And so you only got to see them and actors and you only get to see them on screen in this way [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=650.68s)]
*  And so you really envision them that way [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=655.76s)]
*  I mean you would almost be shocked if you saw a celebrity in person or an actor in person [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=658.04s)]
*  Who didn't like like Indiana Jones if he didn't have his hair was gonna say that is that when I was a kid? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=663.28s)]
*  I kind of thought Harrison Ford was that guy you know what I mean like it that's Harrison Ford [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=668.56s)]
*  I think he's probably the biggest you know movie star of my childhood and whether it was like you know [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  Indiana Jones or Star Wars like he was the guy and I kind of thought he was that guy and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=677.88s)]
*  So it's a little weird to see that guy just like you know in his sneakers and his kind of raincoat walking around Brentwood [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  It's sort of like of course it's disappointing or it's disillusioning or something because you you have this thing in your mind [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  That's people went to a you know Steven Spielberg and George Lucas went to a whole you know use all their talent went to a bunch [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=696.12s)]
*  of work to make this dude look like Indiana Jones and Han Solo and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=701.84s)]
*  I think what I've seen now is like I actually don't even want to see like the actors that I really like I don't want [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=706.28s)]
*  To go on your social because I don't want to know what you had for lunch because it just makes it harder for me [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=712.28s)]
*  To get into like what you know what you're doing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=716.6s)]
*  I love that and that's I think that is a real directorial way to think I think I mean [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=719.36s)]
*  I can see that in your brain. I mean, I'm just a judge. I'm just a guy judging you [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=724.52s)]
*  they just met in a room somewhere, but [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  But I never thought about that that that's how it is that yeah, you don't want you want them kind of you want to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=731.68s)]
*  Hollywood has almost bitten its own tail in that way because there's this underlying like [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=740.4s)]
*  Valueless current really that's kind of like a very cheap currency. It's Hollywood. It's it's Hollywood sort of adjacent [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=746.48s)]
*  Out of media that's what culture that that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=752.64s)]
*  profits from and circles and there's a symbiotic relationship between Hollywood and obviously like here [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=756.76s)]
*  I am promote my movie and running around and now I don't want to go on like a [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=761.16s)]
*  tabloid and do that or with it whatever it is [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=765.36s)]
*  But that that becomes part of that culture too [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=767.4s)]
*  And and then you have like any interview show or all these and you're right in a sense [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=770.14s)]
*  It is Hollywood because if you do a movie at Universal, you know, you'll see that person's doing all NBC [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=773.92s)]
*  Comcast owned, you know talk shows and appearances right like it's not a coincidence because when they do their [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  Presentation in the boardroom for Comcast to their shareholders. They go look we make these movies [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=786.64s)]
*  We spend a lot of money and then we get the stars and we plug them into all of our other shows that we also own [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=791.6199999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of synergy so on so forth. The the idea though is like, okay, there's [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=796.1199999999999s)]
*  That's a kind of a tax that you end up sort of paying on [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  Your sort of life and the one and on this thing that you're trying to build which is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=805.52s)]
*  something that connects with people and moves them and that they want to go out to a fucking movie theater and pay good money to [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  See and it makes it a little bit harder than to have to kind of go around and do all that other stuff and be like [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=816.6s)]
*  Okay. Well, that's not who I really am and that's and and and to try to sort of be interesting and relevant [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=822.8s)]
*  right some other way that isn't really what you kind of even wanted to do and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=828.92s)]
*  So so you're right [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=834.2399999999999s)]
*  It's sort of part Hollywood and also kind of Hollywood adjacent eating [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=835.68s)]
*  It's it does eat its tail in a way because it's because the acting in the creation [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=839.52s)]
*  It's like a watch looking at the beauty of a lake, right? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=843.92s)]
*  It's like this is picturesque and this is like how they meant the waves to look and there's a current here and there's an inflow [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=846.28s)]
*  And outflow and something landed in the water over here and left a ripple and something else is this is the B story [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=852.28s)]
*  And there's a ripple but then it's this under it's this all this stuff under it and it's almost starting to like kind of drain [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  Its own lake in a way good metaphor [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=862.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=864.22s)]
*  like the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=864.4200000000001s)]
*  Jesus the movie as the kind of lake and the underneath of what's both what goes into it what happens behind the scenes and also [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=864.9000000000001s)]
*  What's and it's what it's a thing and it does kind of like it's interesting like yeah [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=870.46s)]
*  Is it if you over tax it it lowers the lake and all of a sudden it doesn't look like a beautiful lake [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=874.62s)]
*  It starts to look like it's like the low country marsh and it pulls down you start to see all black mud around the edges [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=880.0600000000001s)]
*  And the muck and and that's um, yeah, I don't know how to kind of balance that but as a director [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=886.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, you're right. Like I would say that's the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=891.54s)]
*  Way the principal way I've always kind of looked at this stuff [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=894.7s)]
*  so it used to be that you [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=898.02s)]
*  you had an actor and you had people knew less about them and now a part of even casting for me is [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=900.46s)]
*  What do people think or of and expect this person to do and or be and how can I both? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=907.9s)]
*  I have to rely on that and use that but I also [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=914.1s)]
*  Have the opportunity to kind of subvert that in a way and and so you have to be mindful [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=916.86s)]
*  Not just of the story you're telling [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=922.3s)]
*  but what does the audience bring into the theater with them or or when they turn on television, you know, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=924.8199999999999s)]
*  Expect that dude. That's yeah, I think that's advanced thinking to be honest with you. I really do [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=931.42s)]
*  but just [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=937.26s)]
*  Learned by lived experience most you know find out like I even [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=938.78s)]
*  often make mistakes, you know, like if I [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=943.18s)]
*  sometimes have found if I sort of I did a movie where I had like a very blonde wig that was like a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=946.46s)]
*  Medieval we were in flair or something. I wish I was Rick flair. That would be spectacular. I'd love to play [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=952.7s)]
*  It was actually a good movie. I really liked it was called The Last Tool the point [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=958.0600000000001s)]
*  What and it's great director Ridley Scott and he had this idea for oh, yeah, really Scott and yeah [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  There's the thing there you see and and I liked the if that if no one I think had ever [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=965.0600000000001s)]
*  Seen me or whatever. I thought that was really yeah interesting [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=969.66s)]
*  Problem is that I think what I did was Erin Carter created noise around, you know [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=972.94s)]
*  Look at this hair is this different and we know it's a way and so now you look at it and you go [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=977.94s)]
*  But I know he doesn't look like that and so it causes you to kind of think it's false [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=982.0600000000001s)]
*  That's an example of kind of pride not being able to go that far away from myself and still have [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=986.5s)]
*  People go. Okay, I can sit aside what I know and just watch this story and and like it and believe in it [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=993.94s)]
*  That's fast that's insider baseball man knock it it makes total sense [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=999.26s)]
*  It makes total sense that that that would start to affect how we see things [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1003.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, there's something that's happening where it's hard to get people to believe in some of these movies [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1007.26s)]
*  You know and people's attention spans have changed. It's gotten interesting [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1012.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1016.26s)]
*  a bunch of things the but the fact that like even even the online world for example [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1016.46s)]
*  You see now that like shorter and shorter shorter like clips are what even my son who's? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1022.02s)]

*  Yeah, he's fabulous kid and he's and he's he now when I watch him like scroll [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1034.18s)]
*  It's like he didn't even get through the six seconds, right? You know what I mean? He's like that [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1040.78s)]
*  You know and he'll like a long period time for him is four or five seconds and it's and then I'm like hey, man [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1044.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, let's watch this show or watch this movie and it's like he gets bored fast [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1049.94s)]
*  He's got to really love something to sit through it and then he you know binges like all the episodes like we just sat through [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1053.96s)]
*  Like and watch, you know in invincible this animated show, you know, and then it's like let's keep going [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  It's so it's this weird dichotomy up on the one hand. It's like no no no no [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1065.5600000000002s)]
*  Okay, then plug in and like main line this one thing and eat it all up till it's gone [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1069.24s)]
*  And yeah, so it's all it has really changed [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1074.04s)]
*  You didn't used to be able to to like pause and select or even have that much to choose from [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1076.64s)]
*  Like though that many choices is overwhelming to the to the mind like we weren't made I don't believe [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1082.56s)]
*  evolutionarily and and and as human beings to like [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, we're supposed to be living in like a village and see about a hundred people in our lifetimes [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1093.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. That's the the vast majority of human history. That's how we did it and I still feel like in a way [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1097.52s)]
*  That's how we're socialized [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1102.9s)]
*  It's why for example if you're feel left out of a group [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1104.52s)]
*  It's very painful because like in you know thousands of years ago if you got left out of the the the village the group [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1108.56s)]
*  Whatever and then take you to hunt you died [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1116.04s)]
*  Those people to live and so it hits something really limbic inside like even social media [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1118.72s)]
*  For example, you're looking at stuff, you know, damn [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1124.36s)]
*  Why is everybody else's life so good and I'm that seeing the life you're advertising looks so fucking cool [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1125.84s)]
*  And in my inside life feels like shit [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  That also is like a like a basic primal thing and I think that's what and you know [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1132.96s)]
*  This stuff kind of touches but but the amount of information now that comes in because really now everybody's a celebrity, right? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1138.56s)]
*  Everybody is a celebrity. Everybody is followed. Everybody's out there and newborns [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1145.48s)]
*  There's four months old and 1100 followers and it's really if I like 1100 followers is kind of it's just a it's not any different [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1150.44s)]
*  From celebrities just a matter of degree, but this is a formal [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1158.44s)]
*  He can't even open it both of his eyes at the same time and it's like yeah exactly [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1161.24s)]
*  And and that's kind of become the that as the currency of man that looks great [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1165.2s)]
*  You know that like the currency of like fame in and of itself as a desirable thing like people go man [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  I want to be rich and famous like [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1176.44s)]
*  Take rich. Yeah, you know what I mean, you know famous is not they're not gonna make you happy [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1178.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it will cuz it's like oh [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1183.68s)]
*  People like me know my name and kind of know who I am and I feel like I've done something [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1186.1200000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of times what happens if it doesn't come with a real sense of like achievement or accomplishment [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1189.68s)]
*  Yeah, actually feels hollow and empty and like bullshit and like and undeserved [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1194.72s)]
*  Do you think you wanted to start directing because it gave you even more of a sense of accomplishment? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1198.88s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to add a weird question, but does that make any sense? No, it does make sense [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1204.2s)]
*  I wanted to I really I didn't I wanted to fail on my own term [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1207.88s)]
*  So that had gone through some movies that where I was like, I don't like this [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1211.16s)]
*  I don't agree with this but you know, you got to do how it's like being a playing football team [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1213.8s)]
*  Whatever you got to run the plays that the coach sets up [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1218.48s)]
*  You know what? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1220.92s)]
*  They're gonna you know run a draw play, you know get the ball and you know turn around and run a sweep right because they're not blocking that way [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1221.44s)]
*  You know what? I mean, it's just that's not gonna work. Right? So you that's how [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1227.56s)]
*  that that whole art form is sort of structured by and large and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1231.92s)]
*  What I found was, you know [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1237.12s)]
*  I had a real strong sense of the way I wanted to do it and when it when it didn't work [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1238.96s)]
*  When it worked I didn't feel great because it wasn't me that had that feel [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1244.56s)]
*  You know, I didn't feel like I didn't feel proud of it and when it didn't work I felt pissed off like fuck [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1248.96s)]
*  I didn't want to fucking do it. Right? God damn. I didn't want to you know, I said I knew and that's a terrible feeling [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1252.76s)]
*  so I'd rather fail on my own terms or succeed on my own terms and I and that's where I kind of got into to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1259.28s)]
*  Directing and I always I wanted to do it even when I was younger [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1266.1200000000001s)]
*  I liked I didn't have the confidence and the certain point [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1269.2s)]
*  I kind of had nothing to lose and that was really what kind of gave me the courage to take that leap [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1271.6200000000001s)]
*  In the directing you mean yeah, because my like as an actor [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1276.7199999999998s)]
*  I sort of I got real cold and like had a couple of movies that didn't work and then [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1280.12s)]
*  You know all of a sudden it can be kind of over for you. That's why it's a tough really business. Fuck [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1285.32s)]
*  Yeah, man, like there's no like [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1290.28s)]
*  Seniority there's no tenure. There's no [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1293.6s)]
*  You know retirement no gold watch if your show doesn't work or even doesn't work and nobody wants to hire you like they're just gonna [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1295.9599999999998s)]
*  hire someone else, you know, it's there's a [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  Hundred and thirty thousand people in SAG and there's only thirty thousand people that work every year, right? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1304.72s)]
*  And then there's a even smaller amount of those roles where you know, you have more than two lines [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1310.16s)]
*  So it's a very it's very tough, right? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1315.76s)]
*  And so if you're not people aren't watching not coming or it's not interesting see later and now it's different because I think the movie [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1318.8000000000002s)]
*  Theater, you know, it's like it's a new attack. I think it takes novel thinking these days [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1325.16s)]

*  I [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1334.6s)]
*  Think it's they're gonna have to find some new unless it is like [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1336.28s)]
*  Great or new or so novel they're gonna have to find some new ways to either present it or edit it [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1341.36s)]
*  I'm not sure what it is [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1348.72s)]
*  but to me just as a viewer it feels like we're in this shift because [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1349.6399999999999s)]
*  So quickly have people gotten into these quick moments and it's not even that their attention span is short their commitment [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1353.44s)]

*  You had to wait, you know a year for it to come out on like VHS or DVD or whatever [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1372.1399999999999s)]

*  I've got to be really good. Like you can't just you should be like, okay [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1574.6200000000001s)]
*  It was good three movies in the theater every weekend people are gonna go to one of them now you gotta have a reason to [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1578.9s)]
*  Want to go out and see it well, and I'm lucky because you know [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1584.26s)]
*  The reason why I'm really confident about this movie that you count to is actually plays great. It's a really good movie people love it [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1587.38s)]
*  I've been you know, but I was one where I was like, let's make let's test this movie [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1593.86s)]
*  Let's take it out there and I'm like, okay [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1596.98s)]
*  This movie belongs out there theatrically and there's still it's still more difficult in old days [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1598.18s)]
*  This movie would in a home run easy. I'm like the movie's great. It works great. It's a big smash hit [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1603.58s)]
*  Now you have to like okay work hard to get it out there because you because ahead of time you screen it for people [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1608.5s)]
*  They say and the reactions pretty consistent in try me [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1613.08s)]
*  So but now it's like, you know, I think your point about [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1616.0s)]
*  What you have to do like the minecraft movie or Barbie or you know [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1619.6s)]
*  It almost has to become like a cultural event like where people are going acting the scenes that like there's a whole reason to go [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1623.1999999999998s)]
*  Do it kind of you know, we're all really really good and that's really what I really believe in this this movies [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1627.9199999999998s)]
*  Listen, I've you know, absolutely would you come out and say it was good if it wasn't not like that [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1633.84s)]
*  I would talk or talk around it or talk about well, there's some things I like about it [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1638.84s)]
*  but now I wouldn't even want a movie to go out theatrically I think it's gonna work actually because it's [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1643.48s)]
*  You know, I think most it you know [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1648.76s)]
*  there's people that watch this on streaming because I do think the bar is lower and I think that different kinds of movies work on streaming and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1650.8s)]
*  You know great movies work on streaming too, but I would say I would choose to do that [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1656.56s)]
*  This was one that was supposed to be I wasn't you know, it wasn't like we're gonna go out the actually was when the movie [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1660.56s)]
*  Came together and worked as well as it did, you know, we thought this is definitely a theatrical movie and it's it's I think it's really good [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1665.7s)]
*  I'm really proud of it. I love it. John Bernthal's great. It's funny [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1672.94s)]
*  Your brother yeah, that's the to me and it's we're like a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1679.1000000000001s)]
*  Y'all are brothers in the movie. He's not my real brother. Yeah [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1683.9s)]
*  He's and he's fucking amazing in the movie and he plays here. So wait, so who is the accountant? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1687.5s)]
*  No, it's me right I'm this guy's accountant who's got who's are you a CPA? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1693.8600000000001s)]
*  We're out of CPA but it's sort of one of these things where it's just sound a little bit [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1698.02s)]
*  Far-fetched when I tell you but it's actually very plug which is we grew up to obviously together as we're brothers and we had [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1702.18s)]
*  This father that was very tough on us like heavy military guy [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1708.5800000000002s)]
*  This is in the first movie, right and we were kids you see flashbacks and he kind of was, you know, train this movie [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1711.7s)]
*  You've seen the first movie, right? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1719.14s)]
*  This is the second you saw the first one me and John came out like eight years ago. Yeah [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1721.02s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the second one the sequel. Oh, yeah. I didn't sorry man. I put it together and it but I think this this actually [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1724.22s)]
*  You know which is rare and I definitely wouldn't say this for weren't true is it's better than the first movie. It's funny [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1731.82s)]
*  It's got more kind of heart. It's it's more broadly accessible actions better and I really like the first movie [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1737.22s)]
*  So and you directed this one too? No, I acted it got him Gavin O'Connor directed this movie [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  He was a really good director who directed the first one and how do you? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1746.9s)]
*  Decide who is a good director because you're a good director yourself [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1754.36s)]
*  But I guess the way you decide that honestly is by watching their movies [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1755.6s)]
*  Okay, you look at it and you go kind of you know [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1759.4199999999998s)]
*  And and and if it's something that you do you sort of watch it and you can tell even movies where there's [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1762.32s)]
*  Instances where it's like might not be my kind of movie or it might you know my my taste but you can still say [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1767.52s)]
*  Okay. Well this somebody who really understands this is like a master. This is somebody who's very competent [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1773.08s)]
*  Or it really isn't to you to my taste and I'm like this is amazing [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1777.72s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, it's hard to get good at so, you know [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1781.36s)]
*  There aren't very many great directors and that's that's one of the really tricky things about about making movies [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1785.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm really like this is the third time I've worked with this director Gavin and I really like the guy he did miracle [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  He didn't movie warrior [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1795.76s)]
*  Warrior is with the boxer and and [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1798.52s)]

*  There's and he did miracle which is about the Olympic hockey team. Oh, yeah against Canada America verse Canada [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1812.04s)]
*  Thank her so much Russia. All right. Yeah, Russia the original. Oh, no Russia's like shirty Canada [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1817.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like and that's yeah, no offense. He's Russian, but also, you know it [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1824.28s)]
*  So it's not like we're keeping secrets from [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1829.12s)]
*  Oh advertising that so is it would you go work on it? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1831.96s)]
*  So if you and John Bernt all you guys are buddies you get along well, I love the guy [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1835.0s)]
*  Yeah, I knew him. I liked him. So that may came really close with them on this movie [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1838.68s)]
*  Yeah, we just hit it off really well and it's like I'm sure you experienced this like in your line of work [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1842.24s)]
*  Like some people you kind of just hit it off with the works. It's a great like oh my god [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1847.68s)]
*  You don't even know kind of how it happens. Sometimes the chemistry is just not there [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1851.44s)]
*  You know, they're Dylan. Have you ever met seen Tim Dillon? No, what about oh, you just gotta watch him, dude [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1855.16s)]
*  He's so funny. He's just one of the funniest guys they ever made. He just made me think like he's somebody that's really funny [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1859.9199999999998s)]
*  Shane Gillis Shane goes is funny [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1866.12s)]
*  But I mean so but I'm saying like for you personally right like you might find that like you sitting down talking to somebody works [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1868.44s)]
*  Even if somebody's great they might come in and you guys just don't hit it off [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1874.8s)]
*  Or they might be great together in this case [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1878.0s)]
*  I really felt like with John like we got really lucky and we both kind of it's like a two-hander [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1880.12s)]
*  It's like a kind of odd couple sort of brother because I'm very reserved very straight [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1885.8s)]
*  He's very tough and ballsy and so like it, you know what I mean? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1889.84s)]
*  And so we're kind of opposites, but we love each other but we're kind of brothers [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1892.6s)]
*  So we drive each other crazy and we're frustrated with each other and there's kind of [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1896.84s)]
*  Those things really those kind of relationships dynamics and stories really depend on the chemistry you have and and John's a just amazing actor [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1900.36s)]
*  But also it was great to work with and I love the guy I respect him. He's a good man. He's a great father [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1906.46s)]
*  He works hard. He's just everything I [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1910.84s)]
*  You know, I've heard a lot of I've heard a lot of neat things about him because he podcasts as well [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1913.76s)]
*  You know, I think he has you have to take breaks from it if he's acting a lot [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1917.76s)]
*  How long does like selling you shooting something like that? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1921.76s)]
*  and then are there phases during a movie shoot where it's like [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1924.12s)]
*  It starts off, you know, it's like and you just kind of get burnt [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1928.12s)]
*  I like her is there a way to kind of yeah because the way they set it up is like, you know [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1931.24s)]
*  And I don't think this is like optimal [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1935.26s)]
*  So necessarily but because of it how you got it get everybody together and you know build the sets and do all the shit [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1937.12s)]
*  And all at once, you know, it gets you end up working like, you know 14 16 hour days. Yeah, and you know, there is you know [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1942.32s)]
*  It's a function of just some inefficiencies into eight works and sometimes just what you have to do [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1950.2s)]
*  So you you're constantly working on sort of all you're thinking about morning moon night and you go home go to sleep [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1954.62s)]
*  Wake up go back to work [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1959.3799999999999s)]
*  So you can get burnt out on it, but you can also like with account too [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1960.8s)]
*  It was like it started just work better and better than I thought and so every day I was thrilled to go to work [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1964.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1970.04s)]
*  I'm like I want to work with people that I really like [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1972.04s)]
*  Yeah that make cuz like so much your life is spent at work that becomes kind of what like obviously, you know [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1974.08s)]

*  Then I want to be working with people that I really like and respect and enjoy being around [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=1996.8s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not easy to choose that not everybody can you get lucky? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2000.48s)]
*  Well, you know and so I was but this was really lucky. I love John [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2004.68s)]
*  Do have you ever made? Yeah, cuz David Spade and I wrote a movie that we just shot a couple months ago [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2008.04s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, so it was fascinating. I've just kind of learned about how to do it [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2012.96s)]
*  Like we've been friends for long. How long did you shoot for four years? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2016.28s)]
*  We shot for 23 days and we got pretty quick. It was it was quick [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2018.98s)]
*  We got pushed by the fire so everything kind of got messed up and we kind of not everything got messed up [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2023.0s)]
*  But we got like sandwiched in a moment. It was like everybody's here. The winds are 40 miles an hour today [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2027.4s)]
*  We have to there's no we paid for ourselves [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2033.3200000000002s)]
*  So it was like we have to do you find out when people leave your own money on something all of a sudden things like, okay [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2036.5600000000002s)]
*  We're gonna do this like people have a whole different attitude. That's something I've found. You know, like oh, we need a Dalmatian [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2041.52s)]
*  I'm like we don't have a Dalmatian will fucking shave that sheep and [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2046.16s)]
*  Fucking staples some like a tattoo some spots on this [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2050.0800000000004s)]
*  Shoot and with removable glue glue some Oreos to it and get that bastard out there, you know [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2054.32s)]

*  Um, have you ever made a movie that you that you didn't put out or that wasn't put out? Oh, yeah [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  early on I made a bunch of movies that were like [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2071.76s)]
*  Independent movies that you know, they didn't have like distribution that I'm like a studio that said [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2074.8s)]
*  Okay, we're paying for this and when it's finished [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2078.9s)]
*  we're gonna put a bunch of money in advertising because you got to spend a bunch more money to advertise a movie after you make it right and [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2081.02s)]
*  Or at least you know and that that's gonna be that's changing now people are like, okay [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2087.5800000000004s)]
*  How can we do this in a more intelligent way because all that money spent on television commercials just a wasted now [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2091.46s)]
*  That's that's why I'm here like this is a way to do it. You know what I mean? Yeah, dude, it seems exciting [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2096.5800000000004s)]
*  I well, here's the thing. I think when you tell me that it's good [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2102.1800000000003s)]
*  I honestly think that I believe you that it's gonna be good. Yeah, I'm telling truth. The movie is really good [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2105.54s)]
*  I wouldn't be like if you had a movie that wasn't good [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2109.8599999999997s)]
*  You just you kind of do a few the basic things and because look this gonna turn out like, you know [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  You're gonna it's gonna be a bell curve one way or the other the better [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2117.62s)]
*  You are you're gonna move your bell curve a little bit further down and have a better chunk of movies [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2120.18s)]
*  But I got about like 12 movies that I really love and I'm proud of and about [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2124.8399999999997s)]
*  25 that are like I like this. I didn't like that [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2129.62s)]
*  You know and about 10 or 12 whatever that are like that's fucking terrible. I hate this [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2132.14s)]
*  I can't watch it and was awful and when I did independent movies you they would sometimes they just didn't get distribution like no one [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2137.2999999999997s)]
*  Wanted to put it out or I went to a film festival [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2142.7799999999997s)]
*  I haven't had movies that were so like just something so terrible happened when the studio already was [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2144.42s)]
*  Making it that it wasn't put out but you know, you have like they change their plan [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2151.02s)]
*  You can kind of see oh now we're gonna shift to this or that now you can put something on streaming and you don't [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2154.3399999999997s)]
*  Used to be like you were gonna go out theatrical so you kind of were like naked you just had your you know [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2159.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean and if it didn't work everybody knew because they're say look this movie made ten cents this yeah [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2164.02s)]
*  And and you know, you'd want them to take the fucking billboard down. I passed the billboard like [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2167.9s)]
*  The bomb the movies about you know, you're up there at night in your batman costume just painting over it [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2172.94s)]
*  Paint preachers do you ever see Family Man? Did you see that movie? Yeah, I love that [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2179.8199999999997s)]
*  That's like that oh, yeah Family Man I liked really a lot Dunkirk I liked [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  I thought was cool. Chris Nolan's a brilliant brilliant guy. Um [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2191.5s)]
*  Tell me about your movie with Dave's big. What who do you play? Like what is it's comedy? Yeah, it's just bus boys [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2195.34s)]
*  it's like he's like a um [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2199.94s)]
*  Guy he's just like we're just two kind of dumb guys or whatever. We just got the first edit through [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2201.78s)]
*  So it's like I'm watching it right now [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2206.86s)]
*  Let me tell you like that first cut of the movie like when I see the first cut of my own [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2208.26s)]
*  Really like you should not go crazy seeing the first cut and not like it [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2212.98s)]
*  I almost have never like now I have a company and we make a bunch of movies and you know [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2216.82s)]
*  The first cut it's this is one of the only movies where the first cut came in [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2222.1800000000003s)]
*  I was like, it's great really 90% of time. You're like, okay, we got a long way to go [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2225.42s)]
*  It's a very iterative process. They get better and a more work is done after you finish shooting to make it good [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2229.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm doing. So I'm meeting with an editor next week down [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2235.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2238.5800000000004s)]
*  Like this is what's supposed to be funny about this scene like and explain it to them what you think is funny and is good [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2238.98s)]
*  Because they it may seem obvious to you and it probably doesn't to that person like you can lose track [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2245.54s)]
*  We go look the reason it's funny is because you think we're gonna do this [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2250.9s)]
*  We we know this about us from the first, you know, whatever scene and we come in [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2254.26s)]
*  It's that take where I like yell that they got that should be a surprise like you'd be surprised how often it's hard to put [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2258.42s)]
*  Go in and tell tough because I've been spending my nights like watch and now I'm gonna feel shitty too to put your [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2264.54s)]
*  All that work into it and look at it go. What the fuck is this? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2270.2200000000003s)]
*  Right is the worst feeling the world it feels fucking horrible because it's like I'm very particular about like what I create like you [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2272.3s)]
*  Said in the beginning. It's like I like to make things. I know what I want [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2278.46s)]
*  You know, it's like I know my intuition and if I fail on my intuition [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2281.42s)]
*  Then that's exactly where I want to fail because that's pure to me, right? Like that's okay [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2284.86s)]
*  Yeah, and like that's what you want to great, right? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2288.78s)]
*  But it's a very tricky thing for other people to know that you yes and to know you know what I mean? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2290.7s)]
*  Your sense of humor your life view is all obvious to you, right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2296.06s)]
*  But it's just not to people so a lot of times you have to spend like more time than you would have thought [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2299.5s)]
*  Literally going here's what should be funny [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2304.2999999999997s)]
*  If you can explain the joke like you're a super funny guy funny comedian [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2307.1s)]
*  You understand comedy very well [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2311.42s)]
*  So you can sit and break it down to him and go like you got to know this about it [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2312.94s)]
*  What's funny is that you know, we didn't expect me to do this right? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2316.62s)]
*  That's a callback to this other moment or the the whole thing that when I did it [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2319.66s)]
*  What I thought was funny is this take where I did that like because on the set [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2323.02s)]
*  I'm sure you know, you're if you're doing a comedy and you shot it you had moments where you were like, that's funny, right? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2327.02s)]
*  That I think that's funny. I think that's good. Yeah, you sometimes it's literally about going back into the dailies and saying like [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2332.7s)]
*  Okay, go find the close-up or find this two shot [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2337.98s)]
*  The thing where I said to david and david looked at me like this and that was the one where I left and thought [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2340.38s)]
*  That works like there's no mystery or magic to why they're doing it a different way. They [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2345.5s)]
*  Oftentimes just need feedback. It's it is this is not like sculpting or writing a novel. It's not a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2349.9s)]
*  Single person, you know, it's collaborative. It has to be collaborative, right? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2356.7000000000003s)]
*  If i'm directing a movie with you in it and it obviously is going to have your comic sensibility like [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2359.82s)]
*  I got to know and get what's funny to you or i'm not the guy [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2364.86s)]
*  Right, um and and i'm gonna need help along the way any director is going like so how come [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2368.94s)]
*  What what do you imagine about this or what do you think? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2373.74s)]
*  you know what I mean, like [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2375.9s)]
*  That's why you have to explain it and sort of talk about it because that person's got to understand [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2377.18s)]
*  All those things that made you be funny in the first place and start going. Oh people laugh when I say [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2381.18s)]
*  Oh, this is funny. You know what I mean? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2386.38s)]
*  And yeah, and you've put it together and professionalized it [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2387.3399999999997s)]
*  But like you got to share that with them [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2389.2599999999998s)]
*  Otherwise really and then this is also where people sometimes get into fights of course because people's ego gets in the way [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2391.74s)]
*  Ego will kill you you have to be able to hear [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2397.18s)]
*  I don't care what you do. You have to be able to hear like this doesn't work [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2399.4199999999996s)]
*  This is dog shit because the audience will tell you you know what I mean? That's the thing and it's like i'm so particular [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2401.66s)]
*  I'm not particular, but I just know what kind of has worked, you know, that's valuable because not everybody does [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2405.8999999999996s)]
*  So what you have right is that awareness you don't think about it. You don't have you feel it, right? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2410.3799999999997s)]
*  You're like this feels funny or when you see something you're like this feels wrong like makes you uncomfortable, right? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2414.7799999999997s)]
*  You see so that is a thing that's unique to you, right? So you need to [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2419.3399999999997s)]
*  Like give them access to that and get it and when you you know [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2425.5s)]
*  And if somebody's gonna like take it personally, it's it's not personal like it's your you know [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2427.98s)]
*  And what david thought was funny like okay, like you have to be connected in that way and you have to understand that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not about like okay. Fuck you guys now. I'm gonna go make my vision of this thing. That's a disaster [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2438.62s)]
*  No, no, no, I just think like yeah [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2443.98s)]
*  Like this is why this was written this way and this is why it's funny [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2445.74s)]
*  And so this is the first time that we're like more hands-on with it [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2449.02s)]
*  Well, then you should definitely be hands-on because by the way, no one's gonna do it for you, right? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2451.98s)]
*  Oh, I agree with that on its own man [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2455.18s)]
*  It's gonna get better if you get in and work on it [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2456.94s)]
*  And by the way, you're gonna see it again and you have to go. Okay closer now. Let's try this. Let's try that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2458.86s)]
*  And then again the way movies like get better [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2463.58s)]
*  Really is iterative. It's like it's like it's like coats of paint. You know what I mean? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2466.54s)]
*  You got to keep on go. It's like a good paint job on a car as like 12 coats of paint [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2470.22s)]
*  That's why it looks good. Yeah, you know what I mean? That's it [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2474.06s)]
*  Do movies take a long time to edit sometimes? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2476.94s)]
*  Yeah, 26 weeks is the post-production schedule for most movies right that includes uh music [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2479.1s)]
*  Yeah, and and it's it's longer than the production you're trying to grab everything you can during production [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2485.02s)]
*  It's more expensive every day to shoot editing is you rent the editing room. Yeah [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2489.58s)]
*  We needed an hour one day. We had an hour, right this bitch [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2493.9s)]
*  It was 1100 dollars an hour for now. Yeah, it was like a semi endangered [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2497.1s)]
*  I don't want to say in danger or whatever, but it was like [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2501.5s)]
*  Do they charge more if it's like, you know what I mean? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2503.98s)]
*  Like if you can get a chicken they're not in danger you can kill that shit just cut his head off [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2506.7000000000003s)]
*  That's ten dollars for the owl. You can get a tall chicken [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2509.98s)]
*  No one's gonna know the difference. You can take the chicken break his neck and he's turned around [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2513.98s)]
*  You can get a tall curious chicken [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2517.98s)]
*  We'll give you that [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2520.46s)]
*  I think maybe it's just like one of those things where it's like what's the rate for owls? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2521.9s)]
*  You just get to make it up if you sell owls. It's just so it's like god you get into there and there's just all this animal entrapment [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2525.42s)]
*  I um [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2532.2200000000003s)]
*  What else was I thinking about would you let your children well, let's i'm going to talk to you a little bit more about directing so [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2533.82s)]
*  Um because orgo you directed right and did you care about the middle east so much really like a middle east guy [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2539.98s)]
*  I knew I read some of that really I did I did study the middle east in school and so I understood [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2545.9s)]
*  uh [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2551.7400000000002s)]
*  About it. I wouldn't make a movie that I didn't it'd be like [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2552.7000000000003s)]
*  Making a movie with you and not getting your humor, right? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2556.6200000000003s)]
*  Like it would just be crazy like you as the director you got to care more be more interested in that movie [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2559.1800000000003s)]
*  Than everybody else everyone else is gonna be bored of it, right? You gotta love it the whole time through [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2564.06s)]
*  So the big key is like this is gonna be interesting to me [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2568.38s)]
*  There was a lot of things that were interesting to me about that movie one was a real story the cia agent who had done it [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2570.46s)]
*  the the the people that I met and talked to at the cia the actual nature of like [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2574.78s)]
*  intelligence work versus you know what you have seen with a like, you know [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2579.88s)]
*  You know like super spy shit. That's not really realistic and and this story was really interesting to me [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2584.54s)]
*  And also I thought it was like the fact that they had this like bizarre connection to hollywood and this hollywood makeup artist [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2589.58s)]
*  and that we're trying to bridge those two worlds was was really interesting to me, but it was a [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2596.06s)]
*  Scary challenging movie because the director's main job is tone, right? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2601.58s)]
*  Like that's the main dress what the director is going to really create is like what's the tone of this? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2605.1s)]
*  Like what's the vibe? What's our is this serious? What are we interested in? Like what do we consider funny? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2609.1s)]
*  All those things that that you know go into all the choices we make in life from the car you get the closure by all that [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2614.7799999999997s)]
*  What kind of what is your taste and not everyone's gonna like it, right? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2620.62s)]
*  Some people it's just not gonna be their taste. You got to at least make it as good as you can [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2624.54s)]
*  To your own taste to like you said your own instincts [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2628.62s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta find that tone that matches because people want to believe they they're gonna expect a certain tone from you as well [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2630.94s)]
*  I think you know, and when you don't when that tone doesn't work. You're like this is kind of crass. Jesus fucking [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2636.46s)]
*  You know, I'm corny. It's like it's it seems silly or whatever [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2641.18s)]
*  And it's like because you're asking someone to take something seriously that they can't take seriously or or think it's funny that they don't [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2644.06s)]
*  think is funny and and that's where it's a it's a [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2650.14s)]
*  tricky kind of nebulous job, but that that's the most interesting to me important thing about it and that's [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2654.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2661.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, do you would you let your children act? Do you think? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2663.02s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't let them act professionally while they were children no, but I would let you know [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2666.38s)]
*  They want to do plays and shit and make their own kind of stuff with their friends with that's fine with me [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2672.54s)]
*  I I don't I don't think it would be I don't know judgment against people that do it [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2676.54s)]
*  I've done playing movies with you know child actors and stuff. Oh, yeah, and that's fine [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2681.74s)]
*  from my experience [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2685.74s)]
*  Acting as a kid and what I and what I want for my children is not [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2687.5s)]
*  Uh is is not that but also you ought to understand that they you know, I got a 19 year old [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2692.22s)]
*  I got 16 at once 13. Oh wow, they make their own choices. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's true [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2696.2999999999997s)]
*  Right as a dad you just like that is that is that gotta be tough for when you're a dad? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2700.94s)]
*  like you kind of have already lived some life, so you were like [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2706.22s)]
*  ah [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2709.98s)]
*  And not even about acting just about anything and then your kid is kind of like making it like is that and you don't want to [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2710.7799999999997s)]
*  Like probably push them to my like because then you're pressure some dude [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2715.74s)]
*  That's got to be a real like walking a police line or something. Yeah, I mean that's the whole [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2719.02s)]
*  Job of life. It's like for me before I had kids, you know [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2723.74s)]
*  I didn't really realize what my life was about and then this becomes the central challenge of your life and and if you have a [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2726.78s)]
*  Everybody has complications and tricky shit in their life [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2733.42s)]
*  And that's part of being a parent is managing that with what kind of life am I bringing my kids into making a good life [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2735.74s)]
*  For my children. How do you know? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2740.22s)]
*  And that's part of that is my kids are growing up out here in la. I didn't grow up in la [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2742.86s)]
*  I didn't I never met a famous person or actor or anything [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2747.02s)]
*  That shit just seemed like a million miles away to me and totally sure if you're in the rest of the world [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2750.3s)]
*  It feels so far away and then you forget after you hear for a while how far away it seems [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2754.14s)]
*  To other people like if you meet and you know, like just anybody who was in and it just like that's like it was a [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2759.98s)]
*  I remember I was 12 years old in boston and I saw [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2766.7s)]
*  Christopher Lloyd who played the dude on back to the future, you know, yeah, and I saw him walking down the street [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2770.54s)]
*  I think he's doing a play. Yeah, exactly. I followed the guy for like six blocks like now [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2776.14s)]
*  I'd be like this is fucking told your kid following me, right? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2781.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I stopped him like I couldn't believe it that it was the guy from back to the future [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2783.5s)]
*  I lost my mind. Yeah, um, it was the only you know celebrity famous whatever person I'd ever seen or no [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2788.2999999999997s)]
*  And and so my kids are now they're seeing different stuff [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2794.3799999999997s)]
*  some of it's useful for them because it disabuses them of some illusions that I think are worth being disabused of and also [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2797.66s)]
*  But i'm also like I don't look they're gonna if you if you their kids are gonna kind of be and do what [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2803.5s)]
*  Who they are what they want to do [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2808.94s)]
*  Which your job is to let them know that they're loved that they're keep them safe, you know [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2810.22s)]
*  Provide them opportunities and also not you know [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2815.5s)]
*  you got to resist the temptation to to try to get everything out of the way for them because you're gonna learn anything or develop any [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2817.98s)]
*  grid or or [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2824.46s)]
*  Resilience if shit's just easy. Yeah, that's crazy. I didn't even thought about that [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2826.14s)]
*  It's like you're watching them walk and there's something kind of in their path [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2829.42s)]
*  And if you take it away completely then they're not going to learn how to deal with an obstacle [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2833.1s)]
*  But if you leave it there, then you're gonna have to watch them go through an obstacle. That's got to be crazy [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2837.66s)]
*  It's hard watching your kids though, like even trying to climb over something you are instinct is pick them up take them over [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2842.3s)]
*  But you have to like yes, you don't want them put their finger in a socket [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2847.58s)]
*  You know what I mean or drive a cliff and but that doesn't mean [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2850.2200000000003s)]
*  Life has to be hard. Yeah, it has to be difficult in some ways. It doesn't have to be should be traumatic [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2854.14s)]
*  shouldn't be you know, awful or painful, but [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2859.18s)]
*  Things have to be hard for you to learn to do hard things [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2862.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2866.06s)]
*  And this world like it or not is going to demand that you do hard shit if you want to have anything [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2866.2999999999997s)]

*  Or you know or the woman over here is going to do it better and you're going to lose out [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2880.62s)]
*  and also, you know, I don't want my kids to [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2883.8199999999997s)]
*  Have that first big [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2887.6600000000003s)]
*  Tough experience in life and like kind of fall apart, you know [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2889.58s)]
*  You got it like some of the best lessons I ever learned in life [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2892.46s)]
*  Were from failure. In fact for sure I didn't learn much from success. I learned a lot from failure [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2896.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? But the most important thing you learn is that you can survive it you can be okay [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2900.46s)]
*  Yeah, they can knock you the fuck down [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2905.02s)]
*  And you you know you it's like getting like when I was a kid where I grew up that [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2907.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2911.5s)]
*  We used to get fights all the time. Oh, yeah [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2912.46s)]
*  You found out that you get punched in the face and get your ass kicked and that's not and you'd be like [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2915.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2919.98s)]

*  And you know, I mean, it's kind of like tough day. That first day was so tough [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2924.38s)]
*  Yeah, like damn randy. I know it's worse that you have to hear about it [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2929.34s)]
*  Then like just getting hit five times is like, yeah, you kind of get your belt wrong [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2933.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? And but it's the like that's kind of going back to that thing about like [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2937.58s)]
*  Embarrassment like kids will suffer more from being humiliated than physically hurt for example [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2942.12s)]
*  Like that's the shit that really is painful [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2947.8199999999997s)]
*  But no, I don't I don't wish to be clear that on my kid like you don't need to be fighting [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2950.62s)]
*  It should all time [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2955.58s)]
*  but it's [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2956.54s)]
*  You know [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2958.38s)]
*  It is valuable to know that you can fail or have something difficult happen really painful or get your heart broken have some girl be like [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2959.02s)]

*  You're gonna be okay these things are not gonna kill you [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2969.02s)]
*  In fact, they actually do make you stronger if you kind of go like, okay [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2971.74s)]
*  That was if I didn't have some of the resilience that I picked up by [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2975.98s)]
*  You know my early life trying to you know, see see that I would have just kind of given up or collapsed or had [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2980.9399999999996s)]
*  People say bad shit. I'd be like, oh, you know and I fall down and never get up again [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2988.14s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have no experience and you also it sharpens your intuition. You start it all learns [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2991.8999999999996s)]
*  It's all it is if you can see yourself as a tool sometimes [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2995.9s)]
*  It's definitely harder when you're younger because some of those feelings are new and it hurts so much, you know [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=2998.7000000000003s)]
*  Um, here's the thing getting better at anything really never feels good. Like if you're building resilience, it's not a time that you're liking [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=3003.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? It doesn't feel good like so that's okay. I don't like this [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=3010.94s)]

*  But I mean we had like a million dollars to make the movie and everybody like a million dollars like that's like nothing [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4006.0s)]
*  And now it's almost setting people up [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4011.2799999999997s)]
*  it would kind of just be like [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4013.52s)]
*  then you just be doing a show about people getting in arguments and smashing things and having a breakdown because [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4015.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't really even do it for a million dollars like times of change unions and wages and all that stuff like you're you know [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4019.6s)]
*  so but I I really liked that idea of that show and and what we were able because to me it was about like [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4025.44s)]
*  Also creating opportunities for people that are outside hollywood [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4032.2400000000002s)]
*  You know who could come in and be like look I know what i'm doing. I want to do something and then you got to [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4035.92s)]
*  Like, okay. Well, let's see what you can do what um [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4039.76s)]
*  Do you think tom brady's good as an announcer? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4043.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think tom's good as an announcer. I think he's [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4046.56s)]
*  Look me too, dude. I think he's really smart obviously about football. I think that like it's a it's a um [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4049.92s)]
*  People kind of you and you're the like the greatest quarterback who ever lived they think okay now [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4057.68s)]
*  He's gonna come in and change broadcasting for good and and like just being a normal human being it seems kind of like [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4062.0s)]
*  I I mean who do you want to listen to analyze something like if I want to like [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4067.92s)]
*  Somebody tell me about like a you know a concert like I want to hear from you know, some great musician [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4073.76s)]
*  You know if i'm if you're you figure well nobody's gonna have better or wiser analysis analysis than tom [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4078.64s)]
*  Maybe not about like telling jokes or whatever. That's something different. Yeah, but yeah, I think so [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4085.12s)]
*  Um, but he's a surgeon [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4089.92s)]
*  He seemed like a surgeon when he's talking about it and the way he breaks down certain moments and how long it takes to do [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4091.44s)]
*  Certain things he's like well they got about this many yards [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4096.08s)]
*  They're gonna have to move about this many this many yards a second like he's definitely you start to see who he really is [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4098.639999999999s)]
*  Like how much analysis went into that I still think one of his like real [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  Like one of the things that really separated him because you know everybody knows about how like, you know [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4109.36s)]
*  He you know, he was like drafted late and all this stuff like and there's you know [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4113.36s)]
*  It was his like combine numbers weren't like, you know, so people weren't just like this guy's gonna be amazing [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4117.2s)]
*  I feel like one of the things that he has that people don't really talk about is like [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4122.08s)]
*  And this is so fucking important is like I feel like he he has this thing where he doesn't get tight [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4126.88s)]
*  He just doesn't get nervous [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4132.08s)]
*  Like I think that the there is a huge advantage imagine like you're in super [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4133.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and it's like, you know fourth and eight and you got you know, seven seconds [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4138.64s)]
*  And you win you're good. Everyone else's heart rate is banging their adrenals [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4142.88s)]
*  I think it's what makes actors good too good actors at certain moments [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4147.52s)]
*  Getting relaxed the ability to relax in tense situations where other people get tense because tension and stress locks you up [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4150.96s)]
*  You know you panic. It's like everything it's all bad. Oh, it's horrible [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4157.6s)]
*  That's when yeah, dude, it's definitely there's moments the first time i'd ever audition [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4160.72s)]

*  I remember I was it kept blacking out and then I had to like do some scene that I didn't even care about [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4168.64s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4173.04s)]
*  Why are we doing that? I'm sorry. That was not a plan [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4174.96s)]

*  Um, what's something else that you want to direct man? Where is there something? What about you directing timothy chalamet? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4294.96s)]
*  That'd be so dope. He's terrific actor, man [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4300.64s)]
*  He's great [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4303.04s)]
*  you know and I think and that that's really what you kind of like no matter what you do a big part of it is [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4303.6s)]
*  You know 90 percent of it is is they say is like picking the the right actors because you there's really nothing you can do [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4309.12s)]
*  You're you're you're kind of like, okay now go ahead and you can you know get about 10 calibration [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4314.72s)]
*  But the right people for the right role is is is so much a part of [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4319.46s)]
*  What goes into directing is what I was talking about like kind of understanding what people sort of think about or assumptions [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4324.26s)]
*  They have about actors that they are going to watch there's a lot of um [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4329.38s)]
*  Actors that I would love to work with the high market that I'm lucky to have worked some great ones so far [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4333.62s)]
*  And I have I have a movie that i've just finished shooting [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4338.1s)]
*  Called animals. That's uh, make your own movie out on netflix that I directed [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4341.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I got and I I may even direct another movie [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4345.780000000001s)]
*  uh [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4349.22s)]
*  Next year, which is actually pretty quick, but it's not all set up yet [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4350.1s)]
*  but it's something that I really love doing and i'm I will do it like especially like [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4354.34s)]
*  As I got one kid that's you know in college now and the other two like by the time of my son who's who's 13? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4359.62s)]
*  Goes cause then I plan on kind of just directing all the time [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4366.02s)]
*  But like I said it takes so much focus and energy that one of the regrets I have even about [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4368.660000000001s)]
*  movies that I really like and i'm proud of is like [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4374.02s)]
*  What periods of time that I miss with my kids because that that that just doesn't come back [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4376.820000000001s)]
*  You know, it's almost if they're playing head like, okay [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4380.66s)]
*  Maybe they're going to be on a semester abroad or this is going to be going on like i'm doing in la [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4382.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? So i'm not traveling. I'm can be home for dinner and come you know and just make that a [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4386.5s)]
*  Make that the priority but it's it's it's a part of what why I slow down [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4390.34s)]
*  a bunch from directing because it just [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4394.5s)]
*  In order to do it in a way that I understood that it required like it just requires almost total commitment and concentration [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4396.58s)]
*  Yeah, man, because we yeah, we gotta keep telling good stories because it's important [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4403.56s)]
*  That's how people learn things and that's how you remember things and they become part of like, you know history [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4406.76s)]
*  They really kind of tell history a lot of times [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4411.08s)]
*  um [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4413.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely interesting about [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4414.52s)]
*  Oh, you said something about oh, yeah the shooting in hollywood has become so tough, huh? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4418.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's supposed to it's supposed to be getting easier [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4422.76s)]
*  Well, you know, it's tricky because what happened one of the things that's happened is that like first of all movies [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4424.84s)]
*  Used to be made here like, you know country music was made everywhere like that's how it was [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4430.36s)]
*  and then you had other states and countries that started kind of offering incentives because they felt like [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4434.679999999999s)]
*  You know if we bring this business here and like it stimulates all our other businesses because there's this huge [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4442.679999999999s)]
*  uh kind of trickle down effect of from the restaurants the dry cleaners the [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4447.5599999999995s)]
*  You know drivers to blah blah blah all this money into the economy and you know, la or california didn't really [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4452.2s)]
*  I think [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4458.92s)]
*  Whatever. I'm not sure what happened respond or try to compete [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4460.12s)]
*  They have a small incentive now and they've actually broadened it some and I think they're aware of it [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4463.0s)]
*  But but it's it's tricky whereas other states and they're kind of controversial [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4468.12s)]
*  Some states have have felt like they worked out for them and they're happy georgia's got a huge incentive program [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4471.64s)]
*  They get all I mean, you know marvel moves shoot down there. I got a place in georgia [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4475.96s)]
*  And I you know, that's that's I filmed in georgia [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4479.72s)]
*  It's it's in fact the count was we filmed in georgia and that's why right they start offering these incentives obviously been successful [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4481.88s)]
*  Yes, like california's ego about it in some weird way it's hard to figure out [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4487.4s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4490.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not I don't really know enough about the politics of it to know [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4491.0s)]

*  But it doesn't seem as preserved like when you get here you almost think I know it would seem like more of a museum [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4586.76s)]
*  In itself the city at the time. I think people just didn't think about it or somebody's house there in there whatever it was [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4591.96s)]

*  And it is better seen in the theater. So and uh, it's one that I'm we want to leverage my kind of personal word and credibility [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj3ND_S6geU&t=4675.96s)]
