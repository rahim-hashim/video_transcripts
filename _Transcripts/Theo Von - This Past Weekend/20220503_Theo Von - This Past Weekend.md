*  So you you know, you kind of get used to that stuff and you think it's important [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MXRAuYXWGA&t=1893.9s)]
*  Yeah, you know and it keeps people associated with one another. It's like you can relate to other [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MXRAuYXWGA&t=1897.3s)]
