*  I'm going to step over. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=54.0s)]
*  Looking alive. Is that a Nirvana shirt? What's that? Is that a Nirvana shirt? No, I think it's a Basquiat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=65.36s)]
*  Basquiat? Yeah, yeah. Basquiat. What is it? Basquiat. Basquiat. Basquiat. Basquiat. Basquiat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=72.48s)]
*  The artist he overdosed. Oh, no, I didn't know that. All the good ones do heroin, you know? Yeah. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=79.76s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that he had a big collab-o with Warhol, two heroin addicts going at it. They made [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=86.72s)]
*  some cool f*** together. I mean, it looks like drug addicts did it, but they were. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=92.4s)]
*  I've never seen a lot of that Warhol stuff. Trying to think of a good artist that I knew growing up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=97.12s)]
*  I don't know if we had any art per se in our area, really. Yeah. Yeah, no, I didn't. I mean. I don't think we had it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=102.88s)]
*  I was exposed to a little bit of it, I feel like, as a kid. And then I had an uncle who was really into it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=109.68s)]
*  I think I like it more as I get older. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I do like going into a place, like, whether it's someone's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=114.08s)]
*  home or a business, like people that have art colors popping, you're like, oh yeah, this is better than, like, when [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=120.16s)]
*  you're young and everything's just like, you have your apartment, it's just white walls, you're like, this is actually, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=127.28s)]
*  like, oh, that's why I was depressed. Oh, yeah. This shit is sad as f***. This is a sad place to be. And I remember [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=132.56s)]
*  girls coming over to apartments when I was in my early 20s and them being like, this is a f***ing serial killer [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=139.52s)]
*  lives here, huh? And you're like, yeah, it's cool, right? You don't even think about it? Yeah. You're like, oh, you like that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=145.76s)]
*  You like that dateliny vibe? Yeah, it is kind of, when you look back, oh, when I look back on some of the things that I [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=151.6s)]
*  considered, I guess were art or whatever that I would hang on my wall. Oh, dude. I remember I got a jump rope one time [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=157.68s)]
*  and I was so f***ing excited and I, like, hung that bitch all along the wall. Yeah. And you're like, this is my shit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=163.51999999999998s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could do something to help out. Yeah. I think I always, I've never, one of my friends came in my home the other day [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=202.96s)]
*  and he's like, dude, everything that's in here is stuff that was in here when you bought this house. Like, you just kept this. Oh, there's nothing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=210.96s)]
*  Yeah. And he's like, dude, your house, it doesn't even seem like you live here. Like you have to start doing something to make this your home. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=216.96s)]
*  Can I tell you, I don't, I, some things in life, you just realize that you have to, you know, you have to be able to do something [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  that you have to spend the money to do. And like I had to, I accepted that I am not a fucking interior designer, but I don't want the place to look as sad as those early apartments. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=232.88s)]
*  Yeah. It is the thing. You have to call somebody. You just call them. Yeah. You just call them. And what you do is they go, here's pictures of things. And you go, I like this and I like this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=245.84s)]
*  And then they go like, what do you think of this idea? And you're like, yeah. And then they just do it. Wow. And you go, yeah, that's worth it. And it was worth it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=256.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's worth it because it's your home. So you're going to walk in there every time and be like, oh, this feels, this feels awesome. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=262.8s)]
*  And it feels like you because you want it to be things that you pick, but you realize that you're never going to do that on your own. Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=268.8s)]
*  And I mean, you specifically just said that there's shit in there that was there like from when you bought it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=275.8s)]

*  What you got to do is when you have somebody help you, you know, design the place, but in court, like have a few of those like photos or something that are still from when you got it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=335.68s)]

*  Yeah. Cause it's a, but I, yeah, there'll be night where I'm groggy and I'm like, holy shit. I'm the first black, like, you know, commissioner of sure, you know, when I'm kind of just wandering around. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=364.64s)]
*  Good to see you, man. Good to see you too, man. Yeah. Thank you for the, for coming in and hanging out. Absolutely. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=377.64s)]
*  Yeah. I was trying to think about, um, what was I looking at earlier that I was thinking about? I don't know. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Just how it is sometimes. Yeah. It's hot. Yeah. It's getting hot on. Yeah. It just makes you want to not think. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  Do you think there's something nice about like, I've lived in places where I never had air conditioning, right? Yeah. And it's tough, but there's also something that's kind of like primitive. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  And real about like, I feel like the dreams I had at night were a little more like, like I would be sweating in my sheets. Does that make any sense to you? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  A thousand percent, a thousand percent. And it's, you know, the thing is too, is that it's pretty easy to snap your head back into the hottest, physically hottest, most uncomfortable times in my life. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  Like I can actually, you say that and I immediately, I go to this Florida keys trip I took when I was 14 and we were down in the keys and it was hot. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=437.56s)]
*  It was like May, June. It was hot as fuck. And they had no AC and you just, you just, I mean, I just literally remember that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=447.56s)]
*  I remember doing, I worked construction for my friend's family and we were, the dad had bought an apartment complex and he wanted to, he had to redo the apartments. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=455.52s)]
*  So they stripped them down and then we laid tile and grout in apartments in the summer in Florida. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=469.52s)]
*  I mean, we're talking like, you know, it's a hundred degrees with a hundred percent humidity and you're on your knees just like, and you, but there's, and there's no, there's not even wind. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. But like. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  And you need children for that labor. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  You definitely do. You can't have actual adults. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So that was, but like, as soon as you say that, like you just, I just immediately remember those moments. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  And then there's something about like physically, like, cause you hate it. I mean, in the moment you're like, I hate this, but you do kind of feel like you're, I don't know, you're in a different place. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=500.44s)]
*  Like you're, you really feel like you're working. You really feel like your dreams are just about air blowing on you. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=511.44s)]
*  That's like the simplest type of dream you have. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=519.44s)]
*  Or how, like how amazing in those moments is a cold Gatorade? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=521.44s)]
*  Like the, you know what I mean? When, when you're like, you're like, you feel, and then somebody goes, they pull it out of a cooler. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=528.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  It was strong as I could be. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=535.4000000000001s)]
*  And there's nothing sweeter in the world. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=537.4000000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's so good. And you can even taste the flavor. If you're comfortable, you have a game, I don't even know you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like what flavor do you like? Any of them? I don't know. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  Who cares? Yeah. It's like ice. Yeah. Like floral ice or something. Gay bash. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  You're like, that's a flavor. That's insane. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=553.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's always now it's like polar plunge and you're like, just give it, I don't care. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=556.36s)]
*  Yeah. Missing bitches. And you're like, this tastes. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=560.36s)]
*  This tastes actually pretty amazing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=563.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is good. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=565.36s)]
*  I didn't realize I wanted a gay bash, but I do now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=567.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I'll take it on ice, brother. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=569.36s)]
*  Yeah. That's yeah. Those, yeah. You could think of like the fucking most uncomfortable you've ever been. Hot and cold, I guess. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=571.36s)]
*  Yeah. Cold. I never really, I don't think I had too much real coldness in my life. Thank God. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=579.36s)]
*  There's people that are just not, it's funny. Like my trainer, he's, you know, he's like, he's one of those dudes that is like, he just, they get after it. They're disciplined. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=586.36s)]
*  Yes. And like he eats right. He works out hard. Like, come on, like this push, like go. You know, it's another one. Like that's what, that's who they are. They're coaches, you know. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=598.36s)]
*  And the heat, he's like, I like, I like to be outside when it's a hundred and run and people are like, you're going to fucking pass. Like he likes it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=607.32s)]
*  Yeah. He wanted, they, some people want to go there. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=615.32s)]
*  They want to go there, but the dude has no tolerance for cold, which I find hilarious. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=617.32s)]
*  You know, he like, he doesn't like cold weather. He doesn't like the cold plunge shit and like, I don't know. It's kind of fun to like. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=621.32s)]
*  Catch him on the other side. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=629.32s)]
*  Yeah. Catch him on the other side. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=631.32s)]
*  He's just like, man, I want to get to a warmer place. You see his whole personality change. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  I love it, dude. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes. I guess the cold really, I remember at one time it snowed in our town and people had never seen it and people were yelling shit at the sky and just yelling like racial slurs at clouds and shit. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. People were, you know, like just like these ice inwards, you know, just people yelling shit outside and some kid went outside and got hit by an icicle. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  It was like the first icicle that probably ever fell in our area. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=661.24s)]
*  And that bitch fucking hit him right in the cheek and his mom tried to sue the city for like eight years, dude. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=664.24s)]
*  It was this huge thing and she's like, Ricky would have been different. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=671.24s)]
*  And everybody's like, Ricky fucking was never different. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=675.24s)]

*  Going to be Ricky. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=680.24s)]
*  Ricky was never, Ricky never had a chance, you know. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=682.24s)]
*  You think Ricky was going to be a senator or something like that? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=686.24s)]
*  Yeah, Ricky was not. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=688.24s)]
*  He was always going to be cleaning gutters. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=690.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=692.2s)]
*  Ricky was at best going to be a drunk driver. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=694.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=696.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=700.2s)]
*  Like that's how he got his name in the paper. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=702.2s)]
*  But, dude, what was that? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=704.2s)]
*  They used to have those cool things. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=706.2s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=708.2s)]

*  Look at the tires. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=750.12s)]

*  Dude, you got to let this guy die. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=756.12s)]
*  Can you imagine just telling somebody about your accomplishment? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=758.12s)]
*  Like who are you? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=762.12s)]
*  Like I fucking jumped over 20 motorcycles in a school bus. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=764.12s)]

*  Oh, and he hit that ramp, dude. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=773.12s)]
*  There's so much kickback from that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=775.08s)]
*  When the front nose hit the ramp, I think it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=777.08s)]
*  I mean, that's fucking cool, dude. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=781.08s)]

*  Oh yeah, he got busted for what? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=813.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was a racial thing, right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=815.08s)]
*  It was 70s or 80s. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=817.08s)]
*  Yeah, racial comments and dismissal, 1988. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=819.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, oh he said that people were bred to be in better shape. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=823.08s)]
*  Superior athletes, yeah. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=827.08s)]
*  The black is not a good way to start a sentence. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=829.08s)]
*  The black is a better athlete to begin with. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=832.08s)]
*  Yeah, this guy's out of his mind. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=834.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's on point. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=836.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's definitely right, but you don't say it like that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta pretend like you don't think that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=840.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=842.0400000000001s)]
*  Or you just don't say it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=844.0400000000001s)]
*  But what about you see guys like... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=846.0400000000001s)]
*  But isn't it so great to picture him driving that bus? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=848.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=850.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, you're like, that actually looks like a bus driver. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=852.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=854.0400000000001s)]
*  Bro, we had a guy in our neighborhood named Milford, right? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  And this dude never had a shirt or he couldn't be in a shirt. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=858.0400000000001s)]
*  Something was wrong with him. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=860.0400000000001s)]
*  And he would drive us fucking with no shirt sometimes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=862.0s)]
*  And sometimes he wouldn't even take us to school and the police would all come pick us up off the bus. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=866.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=870.0s)]
*  And take us in their cars, yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=872.0s)]
*  That reminds me of Ariel Castro. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=874.0s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=876.0s)]
*  That's the guy that kidnapped those three girls and kept them in a basement in Cleveland. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=878.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=880.0s)]
*  There was a huge national story. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=882.0s)]
*  He was a bus driver in Cleveland. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=884.0s)]
*  And one time, before he got caught obviously, before this whole thing exploded, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=886.0s)]
*  he just got mad and left the kids on the bus and just abandoned the bus. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=889.96s)]
*  And he was suspended. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=895.96s)]
*  That was it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=897.96s)]
*  He was suspended for a year. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=899.96s)]
*  But this dude was a... [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=901.96s)]
*  This guy was driving kids to school for a living. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=903.96s)]
*  Probably just picking out the best ones, interviewing them for years at a time. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=907.96s)]
*  Yeah, he was... [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=911.96s)]
*  Like, all right, come back. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=913.96s)]
*  We'll talk again next week. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=915.96s)]
*  Real fucking psycho. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=917.96s)]
*  I don't think he was kidnapped in my house, I don't think. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=919.96s)]
*  Especially three people. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=922.96s)]
*  Well, at least if you have... [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=924.96s)]
*  You know, they say if you have goats, you shouldn't have just one. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=926.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=928.96s)]
*  That is a good point. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=930.96s)]
*  Yeah, my mother was going to... [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=932.96s)]
*  We were going to get my mother a goat and then when she found out she had to have two goats, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=934.96s)]
*  she's like, I don't want two goats. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=938.96s)]
*  I want one. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=940.96s)]
*  Yeah, but one will they get so sad that they can't stand themselves. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=942.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=944.96s)]
*  I don't think Ariel was thinking like that, but he was... [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=946.96s)]
*  He was a real shit bag of a human being for sure. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=948.9200000000001s)]
*  It was crazy to watch him. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  I remember when the story... [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=952.9200000000001s)]
*  It was such an unbelievable story because he had them for years. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=954.9200000000001s)]
*  And he was such a psycho that he would join the search parties. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  Like when they would have annual... [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=962.9200000000001s)]
*  He would go to those and then he would go back and tell the girls, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=964.9200000000001s)]
*  people are still looking for you and laugh and stuff. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=968.9200000000001s)]
*  I wonder if when they were walking down the street he was like, you're getting warm. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  That would be crazy, right? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=974.88s)]
*  Insane. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=976.88s)]
*  And I would think they start to walk up to his place. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=978.88s)]
*  He's like, I would take a left. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=980.88s)]
*  Nope, just check this place out. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=984.88s)]
*  He's just fucking doing stuff like that. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=986.88s)]
*  And he had... [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=988.88s)]
*  The funny thing is the way that the human mind works is that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=990.88s)]
*  the one that he trusted, there's the three, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=992.88s)]
*  the one that he trusted and he had a baby with when she was there. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=996.88s)]
*  And so he so trusted how fearful he was. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=999.88s)]
*  How fearful they were that he would leave her unchained and free. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1004.88s)]
*  She was so brainwashed and scared that she would just stay until the day that she didn't. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1008.88s)]
*  But she never... [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1013.88s)]
*  It was pretty wild, man. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1015.88s)]

*  Yeah, that's exactly what it is. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1019.88s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1021.88s)]
*  I feel like he would stay in there. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1023.88s)]
*  He will never leave. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1025.8799999999999s)]
*  That roast beef is like a girl in his basement. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  The roast beef and him are one. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1030.8400000000001s)]

*  Who has that? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1042.8400000000001s)]
*  That type of squeal. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1044.8400000000001s)]
*  I think you can only make that sound if you enjoy yourself that much. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1046.8400000000001s)]
*  He's so pleased with himself. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1050.8400000000001s)]
*  I've never met somebody who is so enamored with themselves. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  He'll be like, I understand that people get exhausted of me. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1057.8s)]
*  He goes, unless you like me, then you can't get enough. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1063.8s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1067.8s)]
*  Which one are you? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1069.8s)]
*  He's like, I definitely can't get enough of me. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1071.8s)]
*  I'm like, God. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1073.8s)]
*  How do you have this much love for yourself? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1075.8s)]
*  He's got to enjoy it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1077.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1079.8s)]
*  He probably wakes up every day and he's like, yes, I'm Burt again. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1081.8s)]
*  It's funny because everybody usually struggles with the other side of that. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1083.8s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1086.76s)]
*  He doesn't, huh? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1088.76s)]
*  I don't think, well, maybe, but it's so morphed into this other thing. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1090.76s)]
*  Or with bodies, everybody who goes, I wish I didn't have this belly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1095.76s)]
*  Then he's just like, I look fucking great. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1102.76s)]
*  You're like, wait, what? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1105.76s)]
*  You're focusing on the wrong thing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1107.76s)]
*  Which is what a psychologist would tell you. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1109.76s)]
*  Look at your great shoulders. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1112.76s)]
*  Then he'd be like, oh, okay. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1114.72s)]
*  Then he's just like, yeah, I automatically do that. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1116.72s)]
*  I look fucking great. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1119.72s)]

*  You do have nice delts. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1127.72s)]
*  You have legs like a snowman. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1129.72s)]
*  These little pencil legs. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1131.72s)]
*  I guess I was looking pretty crazily. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1133.72s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1135.72s)]
*  That is interesting, man. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1137.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think he has an infallible, and I don't know what that means, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1139.68s)]
*  but he has this ability to, he has a fucking undefeated, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1144.68s)]
*  there's something about him that's un-fucking-defeated. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1149.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1152.68s)]
*  It seems like it anyway. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1154.68s)]
*  You know him so well. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1156.68s)]
*  You're right. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1158.68s)]
*  It's that ultimately he really buys into I'm going to bet on myself in every aspect. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1160.68s)]
*  I believe in myself. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1165.68s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1172.64s)]

*  He's going, going, going. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1180.64s)]
*  I think almost to his own detriment where you need to go, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1182.64s)]
*  hold back, pull back a little bit. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1184.64s)]
*  Be present in this. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1187.64s)]

*  Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1191.64s)]
*  He's still running, and they're like, this is over right now. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1193.64s)]
*  Then yeah, he just goes and goes and goes. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1199.6000000000001s)]
*  He gets like, it's funny because people just see like a shirtless, morbidly obese lunatic. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  This guy gambles. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1213.6000000000001s)]

*  But he's actually, I would say he's actually a lot smarter than he gets credit for. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1219.6000000000001s)]
*  Because it's easy to go, this guy's just a dope and he's drunk. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1224.56s)]
*  But he's actually, I mean, I'm honest, seriously, he, as far as ideas too, creatively. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1228.56s)]
*  He's an idea man? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1236.56s)]

*  You don't even see people's other, you don't get a chance maybe other things overshadow them. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1439.28s)]
*  You know, you don't get to know them in other regards. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1445.24s)]
*  I think that a lot about a lot of the UFC fighters, some of them are so cool and other shit are so funny or whatever. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1448.24s)]
*  You never even get to know because they're just seen as like this warrior. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1454.24s)]
*  Well, because it's easy. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1458.24s)]
*  All of us want to go, that's who this is. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1460.24s)]
*  And it's easy to define people as one dimensional. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1463.24s)]
*  You know, like Theo's a southern guy and he's a comedian. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1466.24s)]
*  And like, I don't, that's all you are. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1470.24s)]
*  And you should like, I want to be able to describe him in this way. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1472.2s)]
*  If you told me he likes sailing and skeet shooting, it doesn't add up. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1476.2s)]
*  They don't want to hear it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1482.2s)]
*  They just want to hear, this is who he is. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1484.2s)]
*  And make it simple. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1487.2s)]
*  And it's like when somebody goes, somebody says they like guns, they go, oh, so you're like a conservative right wing, second amendment champion. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1489.2s)]
*  And someone's like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1499.2s)]
*  You're like, I'm just a tech nine fan or something. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1501.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But so many people go, well, if you like this, then you are this type of person. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1505.16s)]
*  And the truth is that a UFC fighter can like the ballet. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1511.16s)]
*  But a lot of people just don't want to think outside of what is comfortable. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1515.16s)]
*  Because then it might shatter everything that they believe. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1522.16s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1525.16s)]
*  Yeah, man, because they don't want to think that somebody. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1527.1200000000001s)]
*  That a redneck guy could have a black buddy that he's not afraid to do sleepovers with. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  Because it would fucking ruin their whole ball of wax. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. And then they don't get to be lazy thinkers. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  Because essentially it's being lazy to go, I want to easily define everybody with like, oh, he's from here. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  He's this type of guy. Got it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1551.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what he is. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1553.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting, man. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1555.08s)]
*  I got to keep tabs on my brain sometimes when I try to do that. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1557.08s)]
*  We all do. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1560.08s)]
*  But then sometimes it's also funny if you're joking around, it's a stereotype. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1562.08s)]
*  You have to be able to do it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1566.08s)]
*  Of course. I mean, I think of like these comics like Brian Simpson. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1568.08s)]
*  He's so funny. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1572.08s)]
*  And what I love is that he challenges what people will think. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1574.08s)]
*  Because they want to define him. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1580.08s)]
*  They go like, oh, he's black. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1582.08s)]
*  Yeah, he seems like maybe like a bus driver's son or whatever. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1584.04s)]
*  But they go like, oh, he served in the military. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1587.04s)]
*  So then somebody will be like, well, he's my guy. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1589.04s)]
*  And then you go and you talk to him and then you realize, no, but he also, he has left leaning thoughts and ideas. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1593.04s)]
*  He's a blood donor. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1600.04s)]
*  He's a blood donor. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1602.04s)]
*  Even bone marrow, he'll go that far. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1604.04s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1606.04s)]
*  But the thing is like, you can't easily just define the guy. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1608.04s)]
*  Because the guy is an original thinker. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1611.04s)]
*  He has, you know, he has moderate thoughts. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1613.0s)]
*  He has left because he's like everybody. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1616.0s)]
*  He's a multi-layered complex individual. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1618.0s)]
*  And as like from an audience standpoint, when you watch a guy like that, that's fun because you go, well, he if he was ex-military, he must be like this. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1621.0s)]
*  It's like, no. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1630.0s)]
*  And his ideas are just original, you know, and I love that he challenges people's idea of what he's supposed to be. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1637.0s)]
*  Do you think, yeah, Brian is a really unique dude. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1639.0s)]
*  He's interesting to hear. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1640.96s)]
*  I like how he's kind of a little bit patient with it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1642.96s)]
*  You know, it's like he's kind of that silent killer. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1644.96s)]
*  He's like emphysema. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1646.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He is exactly emphysema. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1648.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1650.96s)]
*  And that takes like real skill and years of smoking. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1652.96s)]
*  You don't just get there. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1656.96s)]
*  Like that's confidence. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1658.96s)]
*  And you got to be good, honestly, to take your time. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1660.96s)]
*  People who take their time are the most fun to watch, I think. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1662.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1667.96s)]
*  That's a good statement. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1669.92s)]
*  Ron White had this great, I think he was, he told Christina this. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1671.92s)]
*  He goes, no, he's like, just remember if you're, if you're doing bad up there, slow down. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1673.92s)]
*  If you're doing good up there, slow down. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1682.92s)]
*  Like across the board. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1686.92s)]
*  Drop it down a notch, right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1689.92s)]
*  Because everybody's instinct a lot of times is like speed up, speed like faster more. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1691.92s)]
*  And then you get it on both sides because you're like, you're like, yeah, if I'm dying up there, I want to get like, let's just go. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1695.88s)]
*  Maybe I can run through this and I won't suffer as badly. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1701.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1703.88s)]
*  And if you're killing, it's almost like this level of excitement. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1705.88s)]
*  You want to keep the gas going. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1707.88s)]
*  And it's like, just slow down. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1709.88s)]
*  Did you ever get in moments where I found like even looking back on some shows where it's like, man, I was in such a pattern of doing my material that that becomes almost a, not a problem, but it becomes something I have to contend with each show. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1711.88s)]
*  Like how do I make this feel original to my face, to my everything? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1725.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1731.88s)]
*  I mean, I call it press play performing when you get into the pattern so much that it's like you press play on the, you know, on your remote. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1733.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1741.88s)]
*  You're like, right here and right now I'm supposed to be right here. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1743.88s)]
*  Here's the show. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1745.88s)]
*  And you just do the show. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1747.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1749.88s)]
*  The great thing is that you, you have the ability to recognize that it's happening. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1750.88s)]
*  And the first I think is that you're out there doing show after show after show. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1753.8400000000001s)]
*  You go, what is going on? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1755.8400000000001s)]
*  And then you realize, oh, I'm like, I'm stale. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1757.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm bored. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1760.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'm doing the same fucking show beat by beat. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1762.8400000000001s)]
*  And even like, like you said, facial, like I turn my face here and I do this and I gesture like this and it's hitting the mark and it's, it's bad. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1765.8400000000001s)]
*  It's bad for you. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1771.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1773.8400000000001s)]
*  And so you start the, the first thing I try to do is go, I'm going to, I have to open that, the next show differently. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  Whether it's a joke from the act that I moved to the front or I'm going to riff at the front or I'm going to, I'm going to write a new, like I have to start differently. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1779.8s)]
*  Because sometimes if you start the show like completely differently, it gives you this, this energy for the rest of the show. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1789.8s)]
*  Like this whole, this something inside you changes. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1797.8s)]
*  I really think the key to all of it is that when you're in that zone of doing the same shit, you have to challenge yourself to do it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1799.8s)]
*  And you have to create something new. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1809.8s)]
*  Because there's no juice like that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1811.8s)]
*  There's nothing that feels better than a new thing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1813.8s)]
*  But it's also work that you don't have to do. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1815.8s)]
*  So that's why it's a challenge because you're like, I have the show works. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1818.8s)]
*  Right. It'll be fine. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1822.8s)]
*  It'll be fine without me doing that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1824.8s)]
*  But it's the only way to get through that feeling of like, this sucks right now. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1826.8s)]
*  I'm not having fun. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1829.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1831.8s)]
*  And there's a little other element that happens with some other magic in the room whenever the, if you can get that freshness somehow. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1833.8s)]
*  It's like, it's, the right word for it is magic. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1837.76s)]
*  Because there's no other way to like, you can only say it to other people who have done it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1840.76s)]
*  But I just remember that like when I was touring Europe, I was, I'd just written some new stuff. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1844.76s)]
*  And then I opened the show and like you start with such a pop of, but it's a fresh pop because you're like, this is my new toy. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1852.76s)]
*  That I was performing the rest of the show with such a level of like excitement. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1860.72s)]
*  And then I would get off and the people that like the tour crew would be like, they're like, man, you're having like so much fun out there. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1867.72s)]
*  And you're like, yeah. And you know why? Because of the first five minutes of the show. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1873.72s)]
*  That carried me through the hour. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1877.72s)]
*  And then there's like, you realize in those moments you're like, well, anytime I feel stale, what I need to do is that. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1879.72s)]
*  I need to like try something new. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1887.72s)]
*  That's what it is, you know? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1889.68s)]
*  And like it kind of applies to life too, right? People who get like, oh, I'm bored. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1891.68s)]
*  Like you gotta try something. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1895.68s)]
*  That's true. Yeah. If you're bored, if you're with your spouse in the bedroom, if you're bored with your buddy and you're just sitting somewhere. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1897.68s)]
*  You gotta order a toy. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1903.68s)]
*  Yeah. You gotta turn on the thing that like it goes around under, like it, it's like cinches the top of your ball bag. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1905.68s)]
*  And then there's the other part on your, on your dick. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1913.68s)]
*  And so you got two clamps going down. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1916.68s)]
*  I mean, that'll change you and your friends. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1918.64s)]
*  Like relationship for sure. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1920.64s)]
*  You and that black guy that are doing the sleepover. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1922.64s)]
*  You're gonna have the best night. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1926.64s)]
*  Dude, I remember one of the first times I realized that black and white people were different. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1928.64s)]
*  We were riding in a truck in the back of a truck somewhere. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1932.64s)]
*  And our basketball coach was taking us somewhere to probably do work for him for free because he was kind of like that. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1934.64s)]
*  And he, we got to a stop sign. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1940.64s)]
*  And then one time he'd been going like 50 miles an hour and my black buddy, this kid Mike, he goes, what's it like to have your hair blowing the wind? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1945.6000000000001s)]
*  That's what he asked me. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1955.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's a good one. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1957.6000000000001s)]
*  I was like, wow, that's interesting. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1959.6000000000001s)]
*  It takes you a second, right? You're like, what? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1961.6000000000001s)]
*  And then you're like, oh yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1963.6000000000001s)]
*  You're just kind of moves altogether. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. We just said, yeah. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  You got a dent in your shit right now. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1969.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  Dude, yeah. You have like a fucking twig stuck in your shit. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1973.56s)]
*  You need to go see someone to reset everything. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1977.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1979.56s)]
*  Yeah. I'm trying to think of what else has been interesting going on. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1981.56s)]
*  Did you guys, you got into fitness a lot recently, huh? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1985.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, on this, on the last tour, you know what happened was that like I always like do it somewhat. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1988.56s)]
*  Right. Because you guys have done that so Brocktober for a while. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=1997.56s)]
*  But even like before that, it was always like, I mean, that would be another time, but I would get like to a certain point and then I would have the mentality of like, oh, I got there. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2000.52s)]
*  Like, it's almost like the race is over. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2012.52s)]
*  Like I'm done. Like now I'm good. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2014.52s)]
*  Like 10 times or more. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2016.52s)]
*  And so then what happens is you, when you go like, I'm done, you just kind of retreat back to old habits and you get out of shape. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2019.52s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're like, oh fuck, how'd this happen again? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2027.48s)]
*  And then you go, I'm going to do it again. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2030.48s)]
*  And then you go, all right, I'm going to work out and eat clean. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2032.48s)]
*  And then you lose weight and you start to get, and then you go, oh, I did, I got to this number again. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2036.48s)]
*  Or I feel, and then you just kind of pull back. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2040.48s)]
*  And so it really was that I got frustrated by that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2042.48s)]
*  And I had this, I had, I had gotten, I was, I was on tour and we were working out on tour, but not really like, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2046.48s)]
*  dialed in on food. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2056.44s)]
*  And the tour was like aggressive, like nonstop. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2058.44s)]
*  And I remember that I got to, back to LA to shoot this thing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2061.44s)]
*  I was shooting this pilot I had written and I was, I was covering the whole production. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2065.44s)]
*  And I went, I remember I was in the, the wardrobe fitting for it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2071.44s)]
*  And I was like, shit, this is like, I feel like I'm going back. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2075.44s)]
*  Like in the fitting, the clothes, I was like, oh, this sucks. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2079.44s)]
*  And then I left there, like after that week. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2083.4s)]
*  And I was like, I have to take this more seriously. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2086.4s)]
*  But the difference is, is that I no longer go, if I see a number that I like on a scale, that means I'm good. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2090.4s)]
*  It's just, I realized that you have to do it, like that there is no end. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2099.4s)]
*  It's just continuous. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2105.4s)]
*  It's like, it's something that you just, if it's about goals, you just have to set new goals. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2107.4s)]
*  You know, like if you, you can't go like, oh, if I see this number, I'm at the weight I like. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2112.36s)]
*  You have to set new fitness goals. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2117.36s)]
*  Like you have to go, well, this month is about, you know, like cardio stuff. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2119.36s)]
*  Or this month I want to see if I can do 200 pushups a day. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2124.36s)]
*  Like you have to set goals. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2127.36s)]
*  That's what I, I mean, that's what. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2129.36s)]
*  So that's what happened for you. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2130.36s)]
*  Had you been doing that before in your life setting, like, I mean, I know we have sometimes subconsciously we set goals we don't realize. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2131.36s)]
*  And we have some of that going on in our general life. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2137.36s)]
*  But have you ever done it that specifically before we were like, I'm a set a goal? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2139.32s)]
*  I kind of loosely, I would say, you know, like, hey, this month, let's go, let's go after this type of thing. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2143.32s)]
*  And things like, like in sober October. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2149.32s)]
*  But this was also the time where I was like, you know, this really as like cliche as it sounds can be like a lifestyle change. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2152.32s)]
*  And now I realized how much I am affected, not just physically, mentally, emotionally by, and in a good way. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2160.32s)]
*  By my like working out a lot and like waking up, getting my, my stuff together, going to the gym right away. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2169.32s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm just having a better day. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2178.32s)]
*  I'm just happier. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2180.32s)]
*  I'm moving around better. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2182.32s)]
*  I look better. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2184.32s)]
*  I feel like I have better creative days. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2186.32s)]
*  You know, like it's all kind of tied together. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2189.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's tied together. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2191.32s)]
*  So I just made it like part of what I do. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2193.32s)]
*  It's like, you know, I just, I know that I want to eat certain types of food that are good for me. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2197.28s)]
*  And by the way, I'm not saying this, like I am the most strict dude and don't ever, but I'm just like, there's just so much more clean eating. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2203.28s)]
*  And, and I like, I like the workouts. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2213.28s)]
*  I like it, you know, I like being active and I just feel like I'm very fortunate in that I have a full time trainer. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2216.28s)]
*  So I know I'm not. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2223.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2225.28s)]
*  I totally understand that. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2227.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a huge advantage. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2229.2400000000002s)]
*  So sometimes people will be like, yeah, of course you can do that if you, I'm like, yeah, that's, I'm, I'm very lucky that I can do it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2231.2400000000002s)]
*  But you also just have to want that in your life. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2235.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2238.2400000000002s)]

*  That used to be one of the funnest times when I was young, dude, we would go and we used to do steroids back in the day. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2242.2400000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2247.2400000000002s)]
*  What kind of steroids would you do? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2249.2400000000002s)]

*  Oh God. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2345.08s)]
*  I found myself running to the edge of the fence if the mail guy would drive off. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2347.08s)]
*  I had a guy, a friend of mine that was in college that was juicing and the way that he would snap after a while, I was like, yo, like this guy is about to fuck and rip somebody's arm out of his side. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2349.08s)]

*  Oh, there was nothing like juicing back in the day, dude. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2373.08s)]
*  My buddy and I met this fellow who's a homosexual and he was a prize fighter, right? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2376.08s)]
*  And nobody knew he was. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2381.08s)]
*  He was just like, he'd grown up fighting and then so then people would just think he was gay and around and he'd beat the shit out of somebody. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2383.08s)]
*  That's a fucking perfect combo. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2389.08s)]
*  It was an insane combo, right? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2391.08s)]
*  And I was like, I'm ready for it. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2393.04s)]
*  Like you're saying like people want to put you in one box. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2395.04s)]
*  Sure, if you're a fighter, you can't be gay. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2397.04s)]
*  Never had seen it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2399.04s)]
*  So we became buddies. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2401.04s)]
*  We're both bus boys and we became buddies and we started shooting up and we'd pull over on the side of the interstate and stuff like that and just douse each other up and we're just driving around. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2403.04s)]
*  It was right around when Princess Diana had died too and it was just a fucking lot. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2414.04s)]
*  And I remember the first day I was in class where I guess the teacher had given me like every quarter she had this stack of papers and she would turn them all back to the students. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2420.0s)]
*  She gave me the stack and I'd had this stack before and it was usually kind of heavy in my hands. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2430.0s)]
*  And now I just remember like she gave me the stack and I was like. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2435.0s)]
*  Oh isn't that funny? You remember the weight of it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2441.0s)]

*  This is light work, baby. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2443.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2444.0s)]
*  This is light work, dude. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2445.0s)]
*  So I remember walking around with this stack and I was like oh I'm a fucking different guy. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2446.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2449.96s)]

*  He'd be like a thousand percent Tom. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2931.36s)]
*  Because the bet's gonna take probably be at least a semi decent amount of time. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2933.36s)]
*  Yeah that's true he's too old for that bet I think. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2937.36s)]
*  I don't know it'd be interesting. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=2939.36s)]

*  Do you remember the first tit you ever saw as a child and how it went out? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3218.96s)]
*  First tit I ever saw. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3224.96s)]
*  No. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3227.96s)]
*  You know what I do remember is, and this is really, it's sad that I feel like this generation just can't really experience this unless they make a concerted effort, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3229.92s)]
*  is that there used to be just such an excitement around a woman in a bikini. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3242.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3247.92s)]
*  Or if you just saw a breast, just a nude woman, you were like wow, right? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3249.92s)]
*  And then you realize that, if you wanted obviously to see something hardcore, you really had to make a real effort. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3254.88s)]
*  And now, you pick up, people have their pornography libraries in their pocket, and so that excitement level is like, their bar for it is so elevated, which I think is kind of sad. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3262.88s)]
*  Yeah, really sad. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3279.88s)]
*  And then they don't realize that just the idea of sex, the fantasy of it would be enough for a long time. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3281.84s)]
*  And then you're exposed to things where you're like, whoa, shit. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3289.84s)]
*  And that's when it starts. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3292.84s)]
*  That's when you can really make a knock on that it's bad to have access to anything and everything. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3294.84s)]
*  I remember seeing erotic art and being like, oh, this is actually pretty cool. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3300.84s)]
*  There's these really great accounts on Instagram. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3306.84s)]
*  And you realize if you see them, you're letting your mind do things. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3310.8s)]
*  And it's actually pretty cool. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3314.8s)]
*  I think it's actually a much healthier thing to do. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3316.8s)]
*  I ruin a lot of myself with pornography. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3319.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm very careful when I say it because I never like to bash them. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3321.8s)]
*  I feel like they're, I know people in that industry. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3328.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great industry, there's a lot of great people in there. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3334.8s)]
*  But I do feel like there's like anything, everything requires some balance. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3336.76s)]
*  And you can go overboard on anything, on food, on drinking, definitely on pornography or something. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3342.76s)]
*  I just feel like it's much better for you if you're young. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3348.76s)]
*  I would be like, if you're in that age where you want to explore that. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3352.76s)]
*  When I say young, I just mean like you're getting into your sexual exploration. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3357.76s)]
*  Like man, try erotic art and see what it does for your brain. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3363.7200000000003s)]
*  Like let your brain tell you stories. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3368.7200000000003s)]
*  Because just like having this access to your search words and just seeing it play out, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3370.7200000000003s)]
*  it's like what will happen is like it's actually, it's not a theory. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3377.7200000000003s)]
*  Your brain starts to, with time, reduce the dopamine levels that you're feeling. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3381.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you get a dopamine drip from that stuff. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3389.7200000000003s)]
*  But because all you have to do is type in what you like, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3392.68s)]
*  then when you see it, you're like, oh, here's a little less. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3395.68s)]
*  And then the next search, you get a little less of it. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3399.68s)]
*  And then pretty soon, the thing that was exciting to you, it doesn't even give you a thrill. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3402.68s)]
*  That's why you hear people, they go ahead and raise the stakes. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3407.68s)]
*  And they just keep raising and getting crazier with it. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3410.68s)]
*  Because it's too, like if it's too easy to access, you're not going to feel the excitement. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3413.68s)]
*  You're not going to feel the rush. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3419.68s)]
*  I mean, when we were like coming up as like teens and stuff, I mean. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3421.64s)]
*  Oh, Pete Benthamen was popular. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3425.64s)]
*  Dude, you just like, I mean, your sister's friends would come over [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3427.64s)]
*  and just seeing them lay around like by the pool or like just hang out in that, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3432.64s)]
*  watching a television on that couch, you'd be like, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3439.64s)]
*  this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3441.64s)]
*  Oh, dude, I remember a girl asked me to hold her necklace while she swam one time. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3444.64s)]
*  And I fucking masturbated like three times. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3449.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3452.6s)]
*  Because I just had never even held something of a woman's for a while. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3454.6s)]
*  I totally understand. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3457.6s)]
*  I remember going to some girl's birthday party or something [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3459.6s)]
*  and she invited all the kids from the class or whatever. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3461.6s)]
*  And like we would all like run into her sister's room [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3464.6s)]
*  and like try to find her underpants and stuff. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3466.6s)]
*  I remember sitting. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3469.6s)]
*  I don't even know how old her sister was. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3471.6s)]
*  I might have been kind of like, we should have been here, you know? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3473.6s)]
*  But it was still like just being kids and like. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3476.6s)]
*  I remember hiding in my buddy's hamper at his house. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3479.6s)]
*  Just to smell his mother's bra. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3483.6s)]
*  And I'd hide in there for a fucking hour and just huff those cuffs. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3486.6s)]
*  I bet that smells. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3490.6s)]
*  God, it just fucking. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3492.6s)]
*  Do you still remember that smell? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3494.6s)]
*  I remember the color of the hamper. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3496.6s)]
*  It was like a green color they don't even make anymore. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3498.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3500.6s)]
*  It was like an old green, almost like the color of the Wonder Years car, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3502.6s)]
*  like the car that they had. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3504.6s)]
*  It was like an old kind of puke-ish green almost. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3506.6s)]
*  That they wouldn't even mark it anymore. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3509.6s)]
*  God. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3512.6s)]
*  And it was just God. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3514.6s)]
*  And it's just like, see those are just little moments. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3516.6s)]
*  Yeah, but now it's just like you put in something next thing you know. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3519.6s)]
*  And I think nowadays by the time you're 17 you don't even care about sex. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3522.6s)]
*  You're like seeing it all, you have no fucking desire. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3525.6s)]
*  That's no fun dude, that's not good for you. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3528.6s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3530.6s)]
*  What else do we got? Anything in the news? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3532.6s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking at this. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3535.6s)]
*  The world's dirtiest man died. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3537.56s)]
*  Oh, I remember this guy. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3539.56s)]
*  Yeah, this is actually. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3541.56s)]
*  And is that blackface or not? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3543.56s)]
*  It's a little bit. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3545.56s)]
*  I mean, he had not bathed with water or soap for over 60 years. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3547.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3553.56s)]
*  Yeah, read that caption. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3555.56s)]
*  I guess he would smoke a pipe filled with animal excrement [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3557.56s)]
*  and he believed that cleanliness would make him ill. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3559.56s)]
*  Dude, that's pretty interesting. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3562.56s)]
*  Because maybe cleanliness is what's killing us. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3564.52s)]
*  Too much, too much. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3568.52s)]
*  So like if you think about in the history of human beings, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3570.52s)]
*  it's only in the last, I mean not even 100 years, less than that. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3575.52s)]
*  Think about it, it's probably in the last like, I don't know, 60 or something years [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3580.52s)]
*  that human beings were like, hey, every day, maybe twice a day. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3585.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3591.52s)]
*  With autism too, they're saying, yeah, like a lot of autism [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3593.48s)]
*  could be caused by metals and different soaps and things like that. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3597.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3601.48s)]
*  Because this dude doesn't look like he has autism. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3603.48s)]
*  From this photo, I can't tell, but he, I remember seeing this dirty. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3605.48s)]
*  I mean, I wonder too, do you think there's just a level where you just stop smelling? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3610.48s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3614.48s)]
*  Like a couple of weeks in, you're like, you smell like shit, man. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3616.48s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3618.48s)]
*  But then after like, I don't know, 30 years, you're just probably like, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3620.48s)]
*  yeah, it just kind of evens out. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3622.44s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3624.44s)]
*  Like he maybe doesn't, I bet you he tastes real bad, but I bet you the smell [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3626.44s)]
*  just kind of, it hit a level that your body, it's just trying to tell you a [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3630.44s)]
*  signal, stay away from this. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3633.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3635.44s)]
*  Dude, when people can plant things on your back, that's probably a crazy time [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3637.44s)]
*  for somebody, you know? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3642.44s)]

*  That is true. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3731.36s)]
*  It's got to be a tandem thing. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3733.36s)]
*  It would be interesting. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3735.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3737.36s)]
*  It's not hard to do. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3739.32s)]
*  It's not like if you heard, you'd be like, damn, I could never do that. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3741.32s)]
*  You can do that. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3745.32s)]
*  I want you guys to meet Larry here. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3747.32s)]
*  He did all the pine needles. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3749.32s)]
*  I used to have, when I was younger, crazy flexibility with my index finger. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3751.32s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3755.32s)]
*  And I used to be able to lay it flat against my hand. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3757.32s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3759.32s)]
*  And I remember having the illusion in my mind that in some way. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3761.32s)]
*  I'm going to do something with this. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3765.32s)]
*  I could go like, lay flat. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3767.28s)]
*  That's really good. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3771.28s)]
*  I'll be that little trebuchet or I'll do something. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3773.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3775.28s)]
*  I'll work for a castle or something. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3777.28s)]
*  But I was actually, I think as little, as young boys, we were just fascinated by, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3779.28s)]
*  remember like Robert Wadd, like the tallest guy ever. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3783.28s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3785.28s)]
*  He was like 8'11". [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3787.28s)]
*  And then there was like the fattest guy. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3789.28s)]
*  He was like, I don't know, like 800 pounds. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3791.28s)]
*  Anything that was like, this is a huge person. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3793.28s)]
*  I was like, that's, yeah. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3795.28s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to do something with him right there. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3797.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3799.28s)]
*  God, he's from Illinois, I think, wasn't he? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3801.28s)]
*  Was he? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3803.28s)]
*  I'm just guessing, but he seems like they would, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3805.28s)]
*  they grow some long stuff out there. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3807.28s)]
*  They sure do. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3809.28s)]
*  I would hate that, man. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3811.28s)]
*  That's the worst. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3813.28s)]
*  You would never want to be, everybody wants to be taller. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3815.28s)]
*  You don't want to be that tall. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3817.28s)]
*  Yeah. He was from Illinois. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3819.28s)]
*  Alton. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3821.28s)]
*  Was it eight, eight something? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3823.28s)]
*  Was he like eight? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3825.28s)]
*  Do you think about that for a second? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3827.28s)]
*  That this dude is nearly two feet taller than Shaq. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3829.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3833.28s)]
*  Two feet taller than him. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3835.28s)]
*  That's so... [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3837.28s)]
*  Look at how strange it would have been. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3839.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3841.28s)]
*  To be that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3843.28s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like, I mean, they are at perfect blowjob height, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3845.28s)]
*  but it's still like, it's not what you want. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3849.28s)]
*  Now that would be interesting. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3853.28s)]
*  Right? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3855.28s)]
*  I think it would be interesting to see someone, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3857.28s)]
*  and they're standing as well. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3859.28s)]
*  I think it would feel very, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3861.28s)]
*  like, or just natural, more natural than somebody having to get down on their knees, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3863.28s)]
*  or you having to lay down, like, oh, here I am, here you are. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3867.28s)]
*  A girl told me that she dated a very well-known NBA player, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3870.28s)]
*  who was really tall. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3875.28s)]
*  And she was like, yeah, I could just blow him standing up. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3877.28s)]
*  And I was like, wow. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3881.28s)]
*  That's got to be interesting. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3883.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3885.2400000000002s)]
*  What a great memory. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3887.2400000000002s)]
*  Think about what he's done and what you've done. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3889.2400000000002s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3891.2400000000002s)]
*  He's got a couple rings, and you remember standing up to blow him. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3893.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, sake. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3897.2400000000002s)]
*  There's definitely something about it. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3899.2400000000002s)]
*  It would almost be like using a water fountain that you didn't have to bend over to use. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3901.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3905.2400000000002s)]
*  How nice would that be? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3907.2400000000002s)]
*  You just go... [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3909.2400000000002s)]
*  And it just shoots right down your mouth. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3911.2400000000002s)]
*  It'd be a lot. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3913.2400000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3915.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I saw this. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3917.2400000000002s)]
*  Garth Brooks is... [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3919.2400000000002s)]
*  He's going to have Bud Light at his bar, Tommy. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3921.2400000000002s)]
*  He's refusing to ban it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3923.2400000000002s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3925.2400000000002s)]
*  His explanation is right down here. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3927.2400000000002s)]
*  I know it sounds corny. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3929.2400000000002s)]
*  I want it to be the Chick-fil-A of honky-tonks about his new bar in Nashville. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3931.2400000000002s)]
*  I want it to be a place you feel safe in. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3936.2400000000002s)]
*  I want it to be a place where you feel like there are manners and people like one another. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3938.2400000000002s)]
*  And he added something there. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3942.2s)]
*  Go down? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3945.2s)]
*  If you go down, he says, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3947.2s)]
*  And yes, we're going to serve every brand of beer. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3949.2s)]
*  We just are. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3951.2s)]
*  It's not our decision to make. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3953.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, it is your decision to make. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3955.2s)]
*  Our thing is this. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3957.2s)]
*  If you are into this house, love one another. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3959.2s)]
*  If you're an asshole, there are plenty of other places on lower Broadway. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3961.2s)]
*  Shots fired, kind of. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3965.2s)]
*  And there it is, Dylan Mulvaney. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3967.2s)]
*  They're going to get in there. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3969.2s)]
*  Do you want to hear something that I just heard? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3971.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3973.16s)]
*  So I've talked about him quite a bit, about Garth Brooks. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3975.16s)]
*  I know you guys have had some issues. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3977.16s)]
*  And I found out, this is, dude, I found out, first I got word about a year ago from like a hundred percent reliable source. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3979.16s)]
*  Sounds, seems good. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3990.16s)]
*  That I was like, does he know? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3992.16s)]
*  And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, he knows. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3994.16s)]
*  And I was like, is he upset? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3996.16s)]
*  And they're like, he's just like, doesn't get it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=3998.16s)]
*  Like doesn't know why you're talking about him. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4000.12s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4002.12s)]
*  And then recently, I guess, so he just blocked me on Instagram. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4004.12s)]
*  Oh. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4008.12s)]
*  And I was like, oh, it's finally, finally blocked me, you know. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4010.12s)]
*  And then the person, another person told me, they go, yeah, I heard, this person said to me that they heard from a reliable source that when my name comes up to him, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4014.12s)]
*  that he on his phone shows the video of me playing basketball and falling. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4026.08s)]
*  And he goes, karma. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4032.08s)]
*  No. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4034.08s)]
*  Karma, yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4035.08s)]
*  And I was like, that's fucking pretty amazing. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4037.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4040.08s)]
*  That a serial killer is finding it in their heart to say karma for the other person. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4041.08s)]
*  Like this man has, I mean, people are saying this man is responsible for hundreds of missing people. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4047.08s)]
*  And he's going to say that it's karma. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4055.04s)]
*  Well, yes, somebody matched up. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4059.04s)]
*  I saw something where they matched up like his tour dates with missing people. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4060.04s)]
*  That's the whole idea. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4064.04s)]
*  That's the premise of this idea. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4066.04s)]
*  People are like saying that I'm, you know, like trolling the guy. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4068.04s)]
*  All I'm doing is repeating what I've heard that allegedly his tour schedule aligns with like dozens of missing persons. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4070.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4078.04s)]
*  And so, I mean, it's just something that like, at least you would bring up and talk. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4080.04s)]
*  Like, why do people talk about UFOs? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4084.0s)]
*  Why have the conversation about something in the, like, well, because people are saying that that could be a visitor from another planet. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4087.0s)]
*  Are we not going to have even a conversation about it? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4096.0s)]
*  If 75 people are missing and they're all in cities that like he had just been in, I mean, it's logical to say, well, okay. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4099.0s)]
*  And look at him there. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4111.0s)]
*  He's telling me, I'm not saying he's done anything. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4112.96s)]
*  But that's the smile and the stare of a guy who has never done anything illegal. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4114.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4122.96s)]
*  And how much land he has too. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4123.96s)]
*  So much land. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4125.96s)]
*  You wouldn't even know if somebody was missing or if you'd put somebody somewhere or not. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4127.96s)]
*  So much land. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4131.96s)]
*  He's the Easter bunny of bodies kind of. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4133.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4135.96s)]
*  And he's so, here's the thing, it's the perfect, you're so beloved that like, you know, imagine the authorities taking you in. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4137.96s)]
*  You imagine the authorities too, they'd be like, I'm sorry. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4141.92s)]
*  We were, this is crazy, but we actually had a dog that can smell, you know, the corpse and it was on your property and it just went crazy. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4143.92s)]
*  And then he'd be like, I don't, I'm Garth Brooks. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4155.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4158.92s)]
*  You're right. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4159.92s)]
*  You're right. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4160.92s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4161.92s)]
*  We're going to head on out. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4162.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4163.92s)]
*  We're thinking, we signed this for my son. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4164.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4166.92s)]
*  Never had a smell like that in its life. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4168.88s)]
*  My son actually went missing on your property. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4171.88s)]
*  In case he comes back, we sign this for him. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4174.88s)]
*  We sign this guitar. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4176.88s)]
*  Appreciate you, G. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4178.88s)]
*  That's it, man. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4180.88s)]
*  Yeah, do you think, has there been something, has there been like a really interesting guest that came out? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4184.88s)]
*  I know Brad Pitt came out to one of your shows, which had to have been really insane. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4190.88s)]
*  That was really insane. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4193.88s)]
*  Is it almost, is it almost a, is it a bummer meeting people that like, because once you meet them, you kind of have met them. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4195.84s)]
*  Is there something about that? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4203.84s)]
*  I think that probably can happen, but then there's people where you're like, that was awesome. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4205.84s)]
*  And they're either as cool or cooler than your brain imagines. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4211.84s)]
*  He was like that. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4217.84s)]
*  He was rad. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4219.84s)]
*  He was really cool. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4220.84s)]
*  I think that's the excitement when, when, because they go, he's coming. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4222.8s)]
*  And then like security came to like check out the place. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4226.8s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4229.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4231.8s)]
*  Just like, not a big team, but just like, you know, it's not, I mean, honestly somebody in his position should have that. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4233.8s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4235.8s)]
*  Because basically I asked, I was like, so what do you do? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4237.8s)]
*  Like, he's like, well, if I see that like a place is a problem, I'll just be like, I don't think you should come here. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4239.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4245.8s)]
*  You know, like a club or like a restaurant or like, it's not good area. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4247.8s)]
*  And he's like, you know, he's just like seeing where, where things are. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4250.76s)]
*  And he's like, so I just, I'm like his advanced guy. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4253.76s)]
*  It was like, it was pretty low key, honestly. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4255.76s)]
*  But then they were like, yo, Brad just parked. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4257.76s)]
*  Everybody was like that. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4260.76s)]
*  And then he came and he couldn't have been, he just couldn't have been nicer and like, you know, talk to introduce those. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4262.76s)]
*  The funniest was when a very famous person was like, hey, I'm Brad. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4268.76s)]
*  And everyone was like, yeah, I know. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4270.76s)]
*  You know, like, but he was just super nice. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4272.76s)]
*  And I thought a lot of times I've had other notable people and what they do is they, they, they, they leave during something, you know, like famous people go, like they just kind of disappear. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4274.72s)]
*  He stayed the whole show, came back after the show. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4287.72s)]
*  He was enjoying it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4290.72s)]
*  He enjoyed it. And then that was, it was a lot of fun. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4292.72s)]
*  Then I ran into, well, I ended up befriending Jason Momoa, Aquaman. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4295.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4301.72s)]
*  And then we went to New Zealand. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4303.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4305.68s)]
*  And that was really fun. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4307.68s)]
*  And I hung out with him for another day. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4309.68s)]
*  Did you all swim or anything? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4311.68s)]
*  No, we, we went to a bar and we hung out with like, I don't know, a group for like 10 hours. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4313.68s)]
*  Dang. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4317.68s)]
*  But he couldn't have been like, he's a real down to earth guy. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4319.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4321.68s)]

*  No, that's cool. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4325.68s)]
*  He was like, I'll crouch down and make you look taller. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4327.68s)]
*  I was like, cool, man. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4329.68s)]

*  I'm going to do a lot of battle for a living in this most recent tour. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4363.68s)]
*  And I just, I just enjoy the guy's energy, you know, just being around him. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4365.68s)]

*  A lot of these fighters are like that. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4379.68s)]
*  There's something about a lot of them, whether they win or lose, because you just value so much that they even could do it. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4381.68s)]
*  Because they're actually really putting, it's, you know what it is like inherently human beings, we respect stakes. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4383.68s)]
*  And if you're a fighter, the stakes are very clear. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4389.64s)]
*  Like you're, you're putting your, your physical body on the line. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4393.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4397.64s)]
*  To, to win or lose. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4399.64s)]
*  And so everybody, we just respect the fact that like, you're going to like punch and kick and like, you know, to your fucking face. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4401.64s)]
*  And like this, this could have like real lasting effect. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4407.64s)]
*  So we just respect it so much. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4409.64s)]

*  Not an exaggeration. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4501.52s)]
*  150 pounds. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4503.52s)]
*  He's like, oh, I'm free of Joey. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4505.52s)]

*  Yeah, Joey. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4523.52s)]
*  You're not doing well enough, Lee. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4525.52s)]
*  You need another couple of 2000 milligrams. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4527.52s)]
*  Lee's over there wearing floaties. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4529.52s)]

*  He forget to click. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4539.52s)]
*  He was just sitting there snoring, sitting down, like snoring in his seat. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4541.52s)]
*  And then Joey's like, look at this fucking idiot. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4547.52s)]
*  He's like, you know what he does all day? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4549.52s)]
*  He watches Sports Center. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4551.52s)]

*  Get your fucking shit together, Lee. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4555.52s)]
*  You are crippling this man. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4557.52s)]
*  Sports Center is all he can handle. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4559.52s)]
*  He's working at Enterprise rental now, dude. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4561.52s)]
*  He's fucking doing good. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4563.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow, yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4565.4800000000005s)]
*  There should be a documentary one day made on Joey and Lee and like a coming back together. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4567.4800000000005s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4573.4800000000005s)]
*  Is this them recently? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4575.4800000000005s)]
*  That might be an old picture. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4577.4800000000005s)]
*  There was nothing like those two. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4579.4800000000005s)]
*  They were like, who was a better name? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4581.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what this is like though? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4583.4800000000005s)]
*  This is like the guy on the left, Lee, gets locked up in prison with the veteran. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4585.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, the guy that's been locked up. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4591.44s)]
*  That's what the relationship was like. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4593.44s)]
*  He's what you're going to do. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4595.44s)]
*  You stay away from the blacks, you mind your business. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4597.44s)]
*  You shower when I shower. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4599.44s)]
*  And then you eat this shit. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4601.44s)]
*  It's just like in another dimension. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4603.44s)]
*  Yeah, brother, he's 84 ounces of Alfredo. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4605.44s)]
*  Dude, he would melt his brain. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4609.44s)]
*  Unreal. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4611.44s)]
*  He would melt his brain. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4613.44s)]
*  Dude, what was the time? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4615.44s)]
*  One of my favorite times ever when I got there, there was, look at that fucking pillow somebody made. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4617.44s)]
*  Have you seen the one where Lee falls asleep alone on the show? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4619.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's working it and then he comes to it and he's like, fuck. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4630.4s)]
*  I've watched it. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4634.4s)]
*  He's so fucking high that he falls asleep and wakes himself up and he's like, I don't even know what's happening. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4636.4s)]
*  I don't know if he's streaming or something on Twitch. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4643.4s)]
*  But it's on YouTube and it's so amazing. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4647.36s)]
*  It's like Lee. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4651.36s)]
*  One time I went in and there was a squeal in the headphones when I went in. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4653.36s)]
*  I was like, Lee, there's some feedback or something. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4656.36s)]
*  By the end, two and a half hours later, Lee was like this. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4658.36s)]
*  He was the squeal. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4662.36s)]
*  And we had gone full fucking circle. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4664.36s)]
*  Kick that mule, Lee. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4667.36s)]
*  Look, listen to the audio. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4669.36s)]
*  He's broadcasting right now. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4673.32s)]
*  Oh damn dude. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4676.32s)]
*  He's fucking out of his mind, dude. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4683.32s)]
*  That's a good place. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4687.32s)]
*  And that's just, if Joey is really close to you, this happens to you. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4689.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4694.32s)]
*  When he drugged me, he fucking tricked me. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4695.32s)]
*  He's not even going to get a shot. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4700.32s)]
*  He's done it a couple of times, but the worst one was when I was in Miami. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4702.28s)]
*  And he told me I was taking a 10. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4706.28s)]
*  And it just fucking ruined two days of my life. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4710.28s)]
*  Like two days of my life. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4714.28s)]
*  I was crying and shit. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4722.28s)]
*  I was on a flight with him. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4724.28s)]
*  And he's like, oh you need a baby Xanax right now. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4727.28s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think this is the fucking formula. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4731.24s)]
*  Get a chewable son. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4733.24s)]
*  And I go, dude, when I finally recovered, I called him and I was like, what the fuck, dude. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4735.24s)]
*  He goes, you needed it. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4741.24s)]
*  I go, I needed what? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4742.24s)]
*  You needed a reset. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4743.24s)]
*  And I go, why did I need one? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4744.24s)]
*  He's like, it's good for you. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4745.24s)]
*  I saw what was happening. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4747.24s)]
*  Like this kind of bang. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4749.24s)]
*  What was happening? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4750.24s)]
*  He's like, nah, you were getting a little, it's good now. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15oVrS4mnYY&t=4752.24s)]
