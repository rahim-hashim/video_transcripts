*  Like and he give him his props. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=208.08s)]
*  Nowadays people don't give props. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=209.56s)]
*  Like actually I watch your show and they're like damn it's some more shit that you made [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=211.28s)]
*  me inspire me to do more stand up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=215.20000000000002s)]

*  Oh wow man thanks dude. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=219.24s)]
*  Yeah you don't give a fuck when you're on stage. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=220.24s)]
*  Well I just want to be I want to be able to be who I want to be able to say whatever I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  want to say you know and I feel like you can't sometimes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  And the whole reason I got into this business because I just felt like the only thing I [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=232.12s)]
*  had was my voice you know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  It's like I didn't have anything else growing up so it was like all I had was my voice so [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=237.36s)]
*  I wanted to be able to say whatever I wanted to say. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=241.28000000000003s)]
*  But then you start to run the risk of people getting upset or you know but I want to run [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=244.12s)]
*  that risk you know. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=248.96s)]
*  It's like you want to be able to you want to be able to have some risk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=250.36s)]
*  A favorite comedian said this is not therapy this is a place where you come and laugh. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  If you want to be put your feelings and shit go to fucking therapy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=257.32s)]
*  Don't come you go to a comedy club to fucking laugh. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=260.8s)]
*  Not to be like why he say that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=263.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=265.16s)]
*  At the end of the day is this funny or you can relate to it or not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=266.16s)]
*  That is what it is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  My thing is it's gonna hit for people that can relate to it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Funny and it's not funny. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  But when you try to pick at what I say now you're going too fucking far. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  Right right right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=277.48s)]
*  It's like your closet. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=278.48s)]
*  This is somebody coming to your closet and telling you why the fuck you got this shirt. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=279.6s)]
*  This is what the fuck shirt I got. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=282.8s)]
*  I want this shirt. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=283.92s)]
*  If you don't like it don't fucking like it but don't come in here and try to pick at [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=284.92s)]
*  what the fuck is in my closet. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  So comedy is in your closet and people step into your room. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=290.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=293.16s)]
*  And it's like either you like what's in my closet or you don't. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=294.16s)]
*  Yeah I think the tricky part gets is like well I'll notice two things. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  For one I notice sometimes I'll do the same thing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=300.88s)]
*  I start falling into the same trap where I will be sensitive about shit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=305.88s)]
*  So I got to watch it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=310.08s)]
*  I'll notice it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=311.08s)]
*  You know it's like because some of that is a trap that's kind of been created out there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=312.08s)]
*  I think social media Twitter did it a lot. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=315.52s)]
*  You know with everybody seeing everything and then realizing no you can just say whatever [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  you want to things and you should be sensitive about stuff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  So I noticed that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah I hate that shit. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=326.76s)]
*  And then also sometimes I've got to be careful because I almost if my mood isn't good I'll [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=327.88s)]
*  let myself lean in there a little bit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=332.4s)]
*  You know. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=334.32s)]
*  Dude you're fucking retarded bro. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=335.32s)]
*  Honestly bro that is so good. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=338.04s)]
*  You got T.D.? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=340.84s)]
*  Dude do I have what? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=341.84s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=342.84s)]
*  Let me think about it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=343.84s)]
*  Oh when you bro when you're asking those people if they had too many plates. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=348.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=353.6s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=354.6s)]
*  At the Gorda Corral. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=355.6s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=356.6s)]
*  It's like you're a traffic guard for fucking bullshit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=357.6s)]
*  Okay so basically the manager had noticed that you've been in here you've been eating [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=362.28s)]
*  too many plates. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=366.2s)]

*  Okay so how many plates have you ate? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=368.2s)]
*  And people fall for it and that's why I tell people it's like a mindset thing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=370.71999999999997s)]

*  And I say it was like I got to get him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=384.12s)]
*  For some reason he had a gun on him too. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=387.28s)]
*  Yeah he patted like that whole time. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  He was like tell him to come holla at me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  Oh damn bro. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  I was like yeah that was the last dude. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  I was like let's get the fuck out of here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=396.24s)]
*  Come to come and talk to me. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  We'll be good. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=399.12s)]
*  I'll be sitting right over here. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=400.12s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=401.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=402.12s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=403.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=404.12s)]
*  So it was definitely funny and it's about energy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=405.12s)]
*  I knew he wasn't taking no shit. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=408.16s)]
*  Ah so you can. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  So yeah that is a big thing reading people's energy and that kind of stuff. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  So sometimes you have to bail out of them because you know the energy is weird. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  I bailed out after he kind of like because I didn't want him sitting and think like or [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=415.6s)]
*  catch on. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=419.8s)]
*  It was a prank and then sometimes he tells me it's a prank and make him even more madder. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=420.8s)]
*  So I never tell nobody it's a prank because now that you embarrassed me on camera and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=423.52s)]
*  you recorded it now I'm pissed off. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=427.12s)]
*  So sometimes you just have to walk away and just let it be that and let them find out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=428.8s)]
*  You know what's funny what I think about is when they go home and tell the story and they [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=433.04s)]
*  don't know it's going to be viral. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  It's like yeah some fucking punk came up to me and I had to slap him and he lied and then [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=437.24s)]
*  comes out on camera and be like bro this is what the fuck happened. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=442.16s)]
*  You're like damn. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=444.96s)]
*  Yeah that dude gets home and he's like look Belinda I got to tell you we ain't going [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=445.96s)]
*  up fucking Golden Crown anymore. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=449.36s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=450.76s)]
*  They up there they got a damn warden up there a damn fucking dinner warden and he's accusing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=451.76s)]
*  people of eating too many plates. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=457.52s)]
*  And they're like bro I had to slap the shit out of him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=459.12s)]
*  We were like all you did? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah I can't go back. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  He did the camera come out and then he never slapped him. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  That's one thing I really be like damn when people see this how do they feel? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=465.96s)]
*  And she's just rubbing his arm baby you only had two plates baby. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=470.08s)]
*  I know I fucking know it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=473.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=475.2s)]
*  Damn that's crazy bro. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=476.2s)]
*  And it's interesting because I don't think like as a white guy I wouldn't be brave enough [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=478.64s)]
*  to go do that shit. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=481.76s)]
*  I think like to a black guy I wouldn't be brave enough to go do it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=482.76s)]
*  And it's really about sometimes like it ain't even about the colors it's about the energy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=485.68s)]
*  Right right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=490.8s)]
*  At the end of the day this is the thing like sometimes we can get so caught up in the motherfucking [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=491.8s)]
*  cover of us but who are they in the inside? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=497.04s)]
*  Because at the end of the day we still got souls. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=499.16s)]
*  At the end of the day if I swat and I was in your color right now we swat I would still [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=501.56s)]
*  be me in your fucking color. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=504.92s)]
*  So sometimes this is like some people are naturally assholes no matter if you black, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=506.8s)]
*  Mexican, white or whatever the fuck you are your soul is going to be your soul. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=510.12s)]
*  So the thing is it's kind of like we are in a shell. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=513.56s)]
*  So it's really like who you are as a person. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=516.68s)]
*  That's what I said me I love myself and I know at the end of the day I'm going to love [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=518.56s)]
*  what's around me. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=522.64s)]
*  So the thing with me is like you're innocent until proven guilty. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=523.64s)]
*  So I don't give a fuck about color. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=526.12s)]
*  At the end of the day I see you as a motherfucking person and this is your image. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=527.4s)]
*  At the end of the day who are you inside the image? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  That's what fucking matters. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=533.36s)]
*  Gang. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=534.36s)]
*  Bro I've never really I've never exactly heard it put to me like heard it put like that that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=535.36s)]
*  is about the person's energy because sometimes I will when I'm talking about it about race [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=540.28s)]
*  and stuff I sometimes fall into the trap of saying of kind of I don't know if it's grouping [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=546.52s)]
*  people but you kind of generalize you stereotype. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=552.4s)]
*  I'll stereotype sometimes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=555.4s)]
*  But the truth is it really is about somebody's energy. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  Some people's energy you know just this ain't the dude. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=560.64s)]
*  But then sometimes you could get it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=563.76s)]
*  You're right because I could go and get I might be able to find the perfect black guy [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=565.56s)]
*  the perfect Mexican woman and then the other person be like if he did that to me I would [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=568.56s)]
*  have. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=573.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=574.64s)]
*  And then the same thing about a white race. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=575.64s)]
*  They say if he would have tried me I would have. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=576.64s)]
*  So you got the would have. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=578.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=579.28s)]
*  Okay fucking big deal. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=580.28s)]
*  I didn't do you. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=581.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=582.28s)]
*  And there's a reason I didn't do you because I know the energy and my energy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=583.28s)]
*  At the end of the day it's not worth losing your life doing a prank or at the end of the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=584.64s)]
*  I try people that's gonna go home I'm a cut you out I'm gonna go home to my family. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm not trying to fuck with somebody that's trying to lose it all over telling me I got [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=592.2s)]
*  too many plates. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=595.4000000000001s)]
*  Like no I don't even want to fuck with you at this point. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  Nobody should fuck with you you know. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=600.08s)]
*  So this is like you don't want to fuck with nobody that's ready. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=601.6s)]
*  It's like going to a volcano you know what I'm saying. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=603.74s)]
*  You don't need to hold on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=606.08s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=607.08s)]
*  Tell me how. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=608.08s)]
*  Because suddenly we in Hawaii bro I'm listening. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=609.08s)]
*  But suddenly me and why. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=611.08s)]
*  So how is it like going to a volcano. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=612.08s)]
*  Volcano. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=613.96s)]
*  When you know it's different ones you know when one is about to erupt. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=614.96s)]
*  I'm not about to go fuck with you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not going on that bitch that's shaking. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah even when animals at the zoo I'm not walking up to a tiger that's going crazy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=620.64s)]
*  I go to the con boy and just pray that I get the best results. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=624.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah I go to that bitch on Xanax over there. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=627.52s)]
*  Give me that kid. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=629.32s)]
*  Yeah that's the one. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=630.32s)]
*  I really feel like that's why I push this a mindset thing because it's really about [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=631.32s)]
*  your mind and that's what people have to start looking at that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it's not even about the fucking color because at the end of the day you got [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  Nikes you got Reeboks but guess what they still shoes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=641.36s)]
*  They do different shit but at the end of the day you're gonna wear them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=644.28s)]
*  We are still same fucking people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=646.4s)]
*  We do have our different images and colors but inside who the fuck are we? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=649.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=653.04s)]
*  Yeah it's interesting because I get like I think I know that right but it's hard sometimes. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=654.04s)]
*  Because nobody look at it like that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=658.84s)]
*  Right I've never heard it put like that so I've never really been able to put it kind [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=660.24s)]
*  of into that sort of context or words you know. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=664.48s)]
*  Because yeah and that just it's just like some people you kind of match up with and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  then some people you don't. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=670.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=672.04s)]
*  Especially if you're trying to run if you're trying to run a prank or somebody. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=673.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah that one the one you did because some a lot of audience may know you a lot of them [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  may not right and that's just the way that social media is right. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=683.56s)]
*  The one you did with the baby powder with that guy dog. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=688.8399999999999s)]

*  I still wouldn't go get the money. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1141.04s)]
*  It goes viral, goes on TV, it goes on, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1142.3799999999999s)]

*  like, you can have lumps in life, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1171.78s)]
*  but just understand, don't get blocked by them. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1173.46s)]
*  Like, sometimes people run into the big wrong, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1175.3s)]
*  and they don't know what's behind it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1177.8200000000002s)]
*  Sometimes you got to probably curve it, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1178.66s)]
*  or you're going to have to knock that bitch down. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1179.7s)]
*  And just know. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1182.0200000000002s)]

*  I'm just about to show her, yeah, I'm just about to show her. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1187.1000000000001s)]
*  Even if I got to do a new one, cool, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1188.6200000000001s)]
*  but she about to see it, so I still tagged the company. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1190.6200000000001s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's still free video, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1193.0800000000002s)]
*  but at the same time, it was still a promotion for me, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1194.6200000000001s)]
*  because it went big, it hit a million views, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1196.38s)]
*  and it was reposted on there, so I still benefited from it, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1198.7s)]
*  and then she ended up seeing my vision. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1201.9s)]
*  Then I started that a trend. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1203.5400000000002s)]
*  After I went up, I started doing other items like that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1205.06s)]
*  So not only that viral moment, I came up with, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1207.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, now I have a series [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1209.3799999999999s)]
*  where I can do other people product with this and this prank, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1210.94s)]
*  and I can use this cup or the item, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1213.62s)]
*  or a backwood or anything you guys need. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1215.5s)]
*  So then I'm going to Walmart, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1217.46s)]
*  asking people, do you work here? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1218.74s)]
*  This, I have this item, and you know what I'm saying? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1220.26s)]
*  It's so funny because it's like pissing them off, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1222.42s)]
*  and then it's just like, yeah, so, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1224.94s)]
*  and then that's when it came into like a tragic, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1226.46s)]
*  like you know what I'm saying? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1229.02s)]
*  But yet you didn't get paid for that first video? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1230.3799999999999s)]
*  I did, she liked it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1232.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay, she did. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1232.98s)]
*  After she realized it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1233.82s)]
*  But you ran the risk of not getting paid. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1235.0400000000002s)]
*  I see what you're saying, yeah. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1236.72s)]
*  Yeah, you have to, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  it's interesting to rely on your own instincts and vision, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1238.68s)]
*  man, like in Hollywood, I got caught for a while. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1241.0400000000002s)]
*  I felt like I was trying to fit into Hollywood, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1244.1200000000001s)]
*  trying to get on television show or do this or that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1246.5600000000002s)]
*  And then finally I said, a lot of these places [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1249.6000000000001s)]
*  that wouldn't give me any opportunity, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1252.2s)]
*  they don't put up a lot of kind of, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1254.0800000000002s)]
*  guys, I'm not even really a Southern guy, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1255.72s)]
*  but I'm from the South. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1257.4s)]
*  They don't put a lot of that on television. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1258.5200000000002s)]
*  And everybody would just kind of pigeon hole you like that. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1261.24s)]
*  And so finally I just said, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1265.04s)]
*  I'm gonna start just kind of doing my own stuff. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  And we started just podcasting and putting out clips [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1269.52s)]
*  that we thought were good. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1271.76s)]
*  And that kind of evolved in at least [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1273.12s)]
*  having our own universe. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1275.44s)]
*  But it's hard sometimes to believe that, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1277.8s)]
*  oh, this is hard. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1280.44s)]
*  It was hard, I'm not hard. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1281.52s)]
*  I'm not hard. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm not hard. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1285.48s)]
*  I mean, I take those pills a lot. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1287.3799999999999s)]
*  Is it horny in here? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1291.32s)]
*  I don't think it's, is it horny in here? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1293.04s)]
*  No, I'll be using that on some of my girls. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1295.08s)]
*  Sometimes if you just wanna say- [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, is it horny in here? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1298.28s)]
*  Yeah, just say that next time you with a girl, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1299.36s)]
*  is it horny in here? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it works. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1302.04s)]
*  Dude, I flirted with a girl last night actually. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1303.52s)]
*  Where, what's her name? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1306.24s)]
*  She was kind of this, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1307.8799999999999s)]
*  she was kind of like a mixed girl, I think. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  And she was a little bit- [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1311.1599999999999s)]
*  So what's your definition of flirt now? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1312.0s)]
*  Being close to somebody and talking to them, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1314.4799999999998s)]
*  not be like being brave enough to look right at them [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1316.8s)]
*  while you're talking. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1319.44s)]

*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1558.08s)]
*  So like I said, racism ain't even all about color sometimes. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1558.9199999999998s)]
*  Like you're racist towards something or- [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1561.32s)]
*  Oh, you can be racist towards anything. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1563.0s)]
*  Like owls. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1564.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1565.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, my buddy hates owls. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1566.84s)]
*  I'm like, damn, what they ever do to you. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1567.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1569.4399999999998s)]
*  But look, okay, so, all right. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1571.28s)]
*  So how can I say this if I was not to say white people? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1572.76s)]
*  What's the Caucasians? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1576.6799999999998s)]
*  Caucasians I think are drugs, that's drugs. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1579.16s)]
*  But I think you could say Caucasians, you could say- [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1582.3600000000001s)]
*  Caucasians. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1584.96s)]
*  You could say honkies if you want, I don't know. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1585.96s)]
*  No, that sounds terrible. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1587.44s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1588.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1589.48s)]
*  You're trying to get me canceled. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1590.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1592.32s)]
*  You could say- [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1593.16s)]
*  All you want. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1594.0s)]
*  Yeah, all you want. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1594.8400000000001s)]
*  That was a good one, yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1595.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was a good one. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1597.72s)]
*  You could do, oh, what's like a good white person [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1598.56s)]
*  that is just like a general white person? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  A group of them. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1602.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like- [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1603.8s)]
*  Cause we African Americans. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1605.0800000000002s)]
*  That would be good. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1606.56s)]
*  Right, so I would say kind of like, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1607.4s)]
*  I don't know if you just want to say white Americans. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1613.52s)]
*  White Americans, that just sounds too white. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1616.0400000000002s)]
*  You're trying to troll us. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1617.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1619.92s)]
*  So I would say just- [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1622.0s)]
*  And then what if you say people like you? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1623.6000000000001s)]
*  That's kind of going too far. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1625.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, people like you, people get offended at that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1626.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1628.44s)]
*  You can't say these people, people like you, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1629.2800000000002s)]
*  gays or whatever. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1632.2s)]
*  Yeah, what is the right term to say? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1633.3200000000002s)]
*  What do you have, Zach? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1635.3200000000002s)]
*  Do you have anything for whites? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1636.16s)]
*  Group of whites. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1639.0s)]
*  I think usually just people call them those whites [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1640.96s)]
*  over there, something along those lines. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1642.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1643.8000000000002s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1645.2s)]
*  I don't know, yeah. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1646.0400000000002s)]
*  So I'm saying what is, so- [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1647.24s)]
*  So some people, people you might know- [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1649.68s)]
*  So people of your kind. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1654.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1655.24s)]
*  That sounds a little bit, people of your kind. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1656.0800000000002s)]
*  People of your kind, that sounds good. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1657.48s)]
*  That sounds kind of cleaned up. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1658.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1660.28s)]
*  Okay, so people of your kind, how do y'all flex? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1661.1200000000001s)]
*  Like you, do you realize like sometimes you like, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1664.0400000000002s)]
*  you know who the fuck I am? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1666.84s)]
*  How do you flex on somebody when they turn you down? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1667.76s)]
*  Do y'all flex? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1670.96s)]
*  Let me think. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1672.44s)]
*  I think some guys do, if they're brave guys, right? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1673.48s)]
*  What about you? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1676.28s)]
*  Like, how you ever flex on a girl? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1677.12s)]
*  Like, you know who the fuck I am? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1678.04s)]
*  Like, in your head. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1679.8s)]
*  We're not actually saying that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1681.88s)]
*  No, one time I got out of an elevator [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1683.52s)]
*  and this guy had gotten in, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1686.16s)]
*  he was listening to my podcast when he got in [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1687.88s)]
*  and I'd been flirting with the girl in the elevator. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1689.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1691.76s)]
*  And so this kid, she was not giving me the time of day. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1692.6s)]
*  How long was this fucking elevator ride? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1694.64s)]
*  This was seven stories. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1696.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1698.16s)]
*  So it all happened pretty quick. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1699.0s)]
*  I got in, she got in. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1700.0s)]
*  We're both in there and I'd seen her before, dude, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1701.5600000000002s)]
*  and she was there, I think with her mom or something [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1704.44s)]
*  and they had a dog, she kept walking this dog [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1706.16s)]
*  outside of the elevator or outside of the hotel. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1708.0400000000002s)]
*  So I'm like, oh man, I've been praying about this [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1710.96s)]
*  and I saw her in the elevator and then this kid gets in [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1713.16s)]
*  and he's like, no way, I'm listening [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1716.88s)]
*  to your podcast right now. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1718.0400000000002s)]
*  And I had just said, hey, if you want to come [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1719.76s)]
*  to a comedy show tonight and she goes, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1723.28s)]
*  oh, I think we're busy tonight, right? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1725.44s)]
*  She kind of brushed me off and then this kid gets in [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1728.16s)]
*  and he's like, no way. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  And so then I felt her energy change a little bit [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1732.2s)]
*  and as I'm getting out, he goes, you know who that guy is? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1734.36s)]
*  And I look back and I could see something in her [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1738.08s)]
*  was like a little bit different, but it didn't matter. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1743.36s)]
*  That was it. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  The door was closed, but I did let it happen. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1747.72s)]
*  I looked back and said, I let her know, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1750.68s)]
*  I know what's going on here. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1752.76s)]
*  So I just ask me questions that I want to know [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1753.8s)]
*  you're welcome to ask me questions, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1756.52s)]
*  but how do you approach girls in public? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1757.76s)]
*  Cause I never seen, I got white friends, I got all types, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1759.64s)]
*  but I never seen a white guy like, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1763.92s)]
*  I think she's cute, I'm about to go talk to her. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1764.92s)]
*  I never see- [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1766.84s)]
*  White guys aren't as brave, I don't think. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1767.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I just, I'm like, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1768.52s)]
*  how the hell do y'all get dates? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1770.0s)]
*  Oh shit, I don't know. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1772.6000000000001s)]
*  Mostly DMs, I think, parents set you up. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1773.52s)]
*  See, there it is. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1777.3600000000001s)]
*  Stephanie, yeah, I want you to talk to Stephanie. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1779.76s)]
*  She's my best friend, daughter, you're like, fuck it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1782.04s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta do it. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1784.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1785.36s)]
*  But that's better too, cause it's word of mouth, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1786.2s)]
*  versus just meeting a stranger. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1788.12s)]
*  Cause then if shit comes back home, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1790.0s)]
*  or she ever steal from you, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1791.48s)]
*  your fucking daughter stole about $20. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1793.24s)]
*  Right, that's true. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1795.8799999999999s)]
*  I think there's danger. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, a lot of bitches steal. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1797.84s)]

*  A lot of bitches steal. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1800.68s)]
*  Why you check your pockets when I'm not here? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, I don't know, it was funny, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1803.6s)]
*  I've never done that either, bro. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1807.3999999999999s)]
*  I ain't stole nothing yet. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1809.1599999999999s)]
*  I used to steal. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1810.32s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1811.1599999999999s)]
*  Is that a part of... [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1812.96s)]
*  Sometimes people do it because they wanna try it, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1818.04s)]
*  and some people do it because they can't afford it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1820.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=1823.44s)]

*  oh, you act black or you act white [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2120.8s)]

*  and now they're in a black body. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2123.32s)]

*  Yeah, no, I mean, just, I say souls. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2144.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm not gonna say black people, but souls. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2147.0s)]
*  Well, okay, I would say this. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2148.6000000000004s)]
*  Souls have been. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2149.88s)]
*  A lot of black children that I see, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2150.96s)]

*  Very mature. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2159.04s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2159.8799999999997s)]
*  Sometimes I see black children that seem like [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2160.72s)]
*  they've been here before. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2162.16s)]
*  I get it, yeah, very advanced. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2163.08s)]
*  They're like over shit and they're fucking 11 months. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2164.3999999999996s)]
*  Advanced. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2167.3999999999996s)]
*  In this motherfucker, yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2168.24s)]
*  You already like trying to go to the senior care center. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2169.08s)]
*  It comes from like, our like mommas, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2171.24s)]
*  like cause black women got good coochie. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2172.96s)]
*  Oh damn, really? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2174.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2176.3599999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2177.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay, that's one question. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2179.2s)]
*  So what was the answer to it? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2180.4399999999996s)]
*  Being able to accept our advantages. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2183.24s)]
*  So being black like I accept mine. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2185.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2186.8399999999997s)]
*  But y'all got something too, but. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2187.68s)]
*  Right, everybody has different advantages. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2189.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2190.52s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what I think is kind of okay. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2192.2s)]
*  Sometimes it's okay to joke about certain things [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2193.16s)]
*  about people that are kind of like just normal things [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2195.6s)]
*  that everybody can kind of recognize. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2198.7599999999998s)]
*  Like I don't count that kind of stuff as racism to me. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2200.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, like if somebody's mean or really ill will, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2203.2s)]
*  then that's different, you know. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2206.3599999999997s)]
*  But I noticed that. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2209.08s)]
*  All right, what's this theory with? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2211.52s)]
*  I think black people eat more watermelon than white people. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2213.88s)]
*  I think white people eat watermelon more than black people. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2216.72s)]
*  Oh, I would think probably so. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2220.12s)]
*  Especially now, cause once black people heard that shit, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2221.72s)]
*  I think they don't even fuck with it anymore. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2224.44s)]
*  Cause that seemed like, black people always seem like [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2226.48s)]
*  they wanna be unique. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2228.92s)]
*  They wanna do their own shit. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2230.56s)]
*  That's what it seems like to me. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2232.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely saucy. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2233.56s)]
*  Like we definitely create a lot of shit. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2234.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2236.8s)]
*  And also I think, you know, America was kind of, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2237.64s)]
*  I don't know if it was like, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2239.6s)]
*  I don't know if it was like a white culture [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2241.72s)]
*  when black people first got here. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2244.16s)]
*  So it would make sense that black people would not wanna do, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2245.44s)]
*  they would wanna only do shit that seems new. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2248.16s)]
*  And we just like, we wanna start a lot of shit. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2250.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2252.96s)]
*  And just come from like, you know, being this shit [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2253.7999999999997s)]
*  and just kind of like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2255.08s)]
*  I just feel like it's really in our, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2257.48s)]
*  like just trying new shit from the way we dress, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2259.08s)]
*  the way we do music. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2261.64s)]
*  So very talented, you know. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2262.9199999999996s)]
*  And everybody talented, but we learn how to do shit [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2264.52s)]
*  and turn it into like our way. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2267.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, and just keep in mind, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2269.2799999999997s)]
*  Mexicans do the same shit. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2270.84s)]
*  They find ways and, you know what I'm saying? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2272.04s)]
*  Y'all do the same shit, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2273.88s)]
*  but you would never know until like you be around and see it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2274.8s)]
*  You know, cause I got, I grew up around, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2277.32s)]
*  my uncle had a white girlfriend. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2280.84s)]
*  So we met the, you know that side. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2282.08s)]
*  What was her name, do you remember? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2284.48s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2285.56s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2286.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2287.28s)]
*  So he got to me and that's what I said, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2288.1200000000003s)]
*  I can relate to her like. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2289.4s)]
*  Man, he brought the whitest name in too. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he did, yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2291.6000000000004s)]
*  He brought Jennifer around. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2292.92s)]
*  And then I could tell it was funny [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2294.1600000000003s)]
*  because she was so comfortable with us. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2295.36s)]
*  But when she brought us around the family, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2297.32s)]
*  it was like she broke the fucking code. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2299.16s)]
*  Like, but, and then sometimes it'd be like that for like, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2300.96s)]
*  you know, they'd be like, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  don't bring that white bitch to my house. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2305.16s)]
*  So it'd be, so some families, like you broke the code. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2306.68s)]
*  And so, and that's what I said, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2309.3599999999997s)]
*  where it leads in where certain people, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2311.16s)]
*  and some people accept it, like, oh, like, you know. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2313.44s)]
*  So it was, it's just get in where you fit in. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2315.68s)]
*  If you're uncomfortable, don't be around. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2317.68s)]
*  But she definitely broke the code bringing us over [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2319.2s)]
*  to Thanksgiving, especially in the food wasn't, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2321.56s)]
*  I didn't like the food. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2324.7599999999998s)]
*  So not only that, like the food was not. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2325.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was different. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2328.52s)]
*  Yeah, if the code. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2329.6s)]
*  But I really feel like if you do do that, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2330.44s)]
*  let the family know, talk to them, don't make it awkward. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2332.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2334.6800000000003s)]
*  Like. Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2335.52s)]
*  It's better to say, hey, I'm bringing over an Indian [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2336.52s)]
*  or a Native American. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2338.76s)]
*  I'm bringing over a Swedish guy or a woman [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2339.76s)]
*  or a black guy or a Japanese woman [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2343.44s)]
*  and see how everybody feels. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2347.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's a good call. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2348.6s)]
*  But overall, when it lead into it, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2349.44s)]
*  all the stuff we talking about, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2350.92s)]
*  it's just crazy because we still a soul. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2352.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's just talking about colors. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2354.08s)]
*  It's just a subject to talk about. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2355.2000000000003s)]
*  Because there ain't nobody talking about. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2357.32s)]
*  That's a real cool TV. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2359.2400000000002s)]
*  Nobody arguing about Samsung versus Roku. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2360.84s)]
*  It's just a fucking TV. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2363.56s)]

*  Like you know what I'm saying? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2652.32s)]
*  Because you spend so much money, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2653.1600000000003s)]
*  people quitting, coming in and coming out, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2653.98s)]
*  drug straining, you spend them a lot of shit. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2656.04s)]
*  So if you give 100... [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  Imagine if you get $100 an hour, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2659.08s)]
*  Walmart, it will be a team. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2661.48s)]

*  It's hard as hell to serve something, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2683.56s)]
*  you know they got a man out there trying to touch. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2685.0s)]
*  You know, in the little... [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2687.8399999999997s)]
*  In the play area. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2691.3599999999997s)]

*  I don't know what McDonald's you went to, but we... [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2696.7599999999998s)]
*  Covington, Louisiana, bro, we'd be in that bitch. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2699.6s)]
*  They had a dude always out there. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2701.9599999999996s)]
*  Did he have like... [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2705.12s)]
*  Let's talk about this, I have a thing. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2705.9599999999996s)]
*  So this is something that I think about sometimes. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2708.16s)]
*  Sometimes I always felt like a lot of black people [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2711.64s)]
*  thought like, oh, white people have it so good [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2713.88s)]
*  about work and stuff. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2716.8399999999997s)]
*  But then, the whole time, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2718.6s)]
*  I was fucking working for somebody for shit. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2721.64s)]
*  You know, it was like, sometimes it was felt like [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2723.48s)]
*  there was a perception that it was better. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2725.2s)]
*  And I know probably black people couldn't get hired [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  for stuff, but then there was this perception [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2730.44s)]
*  that it was fucking great. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2732.08s)]
*  But then now you realize, I think now there's more, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2733.52s)]
*  some more equality, because you see like, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2735.7999999999997s)]
*  a black dude's just like, oh, this fucking sucks. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2738.48s)]
*  This is what I've been waiting to get to, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2739.88s)]
*  and this is fucking bullshit. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2741.4s)]
*  And it shows where they kind of like, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2744.1600000000003s)]
*  some jobs don't hire people because of that, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2746.84s)]
*  in different franchises. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2748.52s)]
*  And that's what they, you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2750.28s)]
*  I get that because it has happened where some people [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2752.2000000000003s)]
*  want to go work for Delta, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2754.96s)]
*  but they only hired a certain color. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2756.36s)]
*  That's like what the coaches in the NFL, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2757.84s)]
*  where they're saying they're getting more [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2759.6800000000003s)]
*  black coaches in the NFL because they never have. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2760.84s)]
*  So, and then they get it, they might not like it. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2762.92s)]
*  So that's what we're going with, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2764.88s)]
*  like how they probably want something [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2765.88s)]
*  and then they get it, it's like, damn, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2768.4s)]
*  this is not what the fuck I wanted. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2769.24s)]
*  It's not what it seemed. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2770.08s)]
*  Well, just that it didn't like, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2771.08s)]
*  I think sometimes it felt like there was this perception [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2772.72s)]
*  that it was so great for some white folks, some jobs. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2775.16s)]
*  But then you get the job if you're not white, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2778.8399999999997s)]
*  and you realize, oh, this shit wasn't even that great. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2781.64s)]
*  I thought it was great for them, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2783.64s)]
*  but they're just up here getting- [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2785.4s)]
*  Yeah, I want better than this shit. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2786.52s)]
*  Right, I want, yeah, it's like, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2787.8399999999997s)]
*  sometimes I would feel like, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2790.04s)]
*  oh, like some people thought like it was magical being white, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2794.12s)]
*  but it wasn't, it just, but now it's just, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2798.24s)]
*  now you see everybody's on damn depression, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2800.88s)]
*  it's just the same shit. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2802.72s)]
*  I'm crying in my car outside of a damn Jimmy John. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2803.56s)]
*  This is just, it's nothing, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2806.2799999999997s)]
*  it's not really that amazing for most people. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2807.56s)]
*  Most people are still working for even a bigger, fancier- [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2810.52s)]
*  Everything they get are ain't gold. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2813.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2815.48s)]
*  So that comes with people learning theyself, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2816.48s)]
*  and that's when you're happy with yourself. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2819.56s)]
*  You're not worried about [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2821.0s)]
*  what the next motherfucker doing. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2821.84s)]
*  So white, black, Mexican, once you worry about you, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2823.1200000000003s)]
*  and you worry about what the fuck your goal is, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2825.44s)]
*  you won't, you know what I'm saying? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2827.6000000000004s)]
*  You won't have to deal with that. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's a such thing that my dead grandpa [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2830.2000000000003s)]
*  that's still alive told me, he was just like, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2833.84s)]
*  basically when you driving your car, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2836.1200000000003s)]
*  you always gotta look forward, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2838.2400000000002s)]
*  but when you look back to look at him, little motherfucker, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2839.4s)]
*  it's a chance to wreck, or you gonna swerve. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2841.92s)]
*  So at the end of the day, stay in your fucking lane, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2844.6800000000003s)]
*  and mind your fucking business, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2846.7200000000003s)]
*  and God gonna give you wherever you need to go, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2847.88s)]
*  if you believe in God. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2850.1200000000003s)]
*  Sorry, some people don't, but that's just what I gotta say. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2851.0s)]
*  But if you, God gonna take you wherever you gotta go. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2853.32s)]
*  And if you believe in yourself, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2855.72s)]
*  you gonna take you where you need to go. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2856.84s)]
*  And that's it, but you cannot drive a car [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2858.4s)]
*  and feel like you're gonna get [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2860.72s)]
*  where you need to go looking back. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2862.48s)]
*  And that's when you say where people like, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2864.2s)]
*  damn, what they doing over there? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2865.44s)]
*  I wanna go over there. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2866.52s)]
*  And then you fuck up and crash. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2867.8s)]
*  So it's being really true to yourself and manifesting. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2869.16s)]
*  So fuck all the race shit when it come to that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2873.12s)]
*  If you want that, you can get it. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2875.88s)]
*  You might get it somewhere else. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2877.24s)]
*  And you can't get a job, and I get it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2878.32s)]
*  I'm from Kansas City, Missouri. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2881.6400000000003s)]
*  They don't really hire a lot of blacks on certain jobs. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2882.48s)]
*  I come to Atlanta and I see, damn, it's a road they can do. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2884.0800000000004s)]
*  Sometimes you can just remove out of that place, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2887.1200000000003s)]
*  go to a new fucking state. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2889.4s)]

*  Oh yeah, Atlanta is fucking like, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2891.84s)]
*  February started a city and that motherfucking thing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2893.76s)]
*  And it gives you a lot of opportunities. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2896.0800000000004s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2897.6000000000004s)]
*  When you see what happens to a culture [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2898.44s)]
*  when they have a lot of money, it's pretty crazy, right? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2899.96s)]
*  Because you didn't really, they didn't have it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2902.6000000000004s)]
*  Atlanta wasn't like that like 30 years ago. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=2903.6800000000003s)]

*  I actually, I probably could see myself doing it. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3206.2799999999997s)]
*  Actually doing it and just kind of like, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3208.96s)]
*  I wear overalls with glasses and have a toothpick in my mouth. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3211.04s)]
*  And I'll be so dope. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3214.6s)]
*  I'm like, you fucking that shit up. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3215.96s)]
*  So I'll be like, there it no is me. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3217.92s)]
*  And then I'll stand out to have my own camera production. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3220.3199999999997s)]
*  But my whole goal is to stand out. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3224.4s)]
*  And then I end up getting away from porn and shooting movies. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3226.52s)]
*  And they be like, oh, you fucking that shit up. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3229.44s)]
*  And I had that scene when people see me like, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3231.12s)]
*  oh, that's the fucking this shit up dude. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3232.68s)]
*  So then I have my own fan base and I get booked for clubs [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3234.52s)]
*  and I become fucking famous. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3237.04s)]
*  So sometimes you could take the worst job [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3238.72s)]
*  and just make the best out of it. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3240.48s)]
*  Cause like I told you, I used to work at McDonald's. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3242.2s)]
*  You won't believe what I used to do. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3244.08s)]
*  Oh you did? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3244.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3245.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't know that you worked over there. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3246.6s)]
*  Yeah, I was the dude, like when people get double patties, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3247.44s)]
*  I just slay one out and just give them like, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3249.2s)]
*  you know, one single. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3251.08s)]
*  And they was like, single patty man. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3252.12s)]
*  Cause I don't think you need all that meat. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3254.52s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3255.88s)]
*  Well, I think it depends. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3257.08s)]
*  I mean, people, you know, I'm not judging or anything, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3259.0s)]
*  but I think people want they meat, you know, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3261.2s)]
*  if you drive around the building. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3262.64s)]
*  Like how much meat do you be taking? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3264.6s)]
*  I've taken, I mean, I'll be honest with you. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3268.0s)]
*  I had McDonald's last night and I had three patties. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3269.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3272.12s)]
*  I had one quarter pounder and two cheeseburger patties. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3273.4s)]
*  You know, what's the most meat you could take you think? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3277.2s)]
*  I don't really take meat. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3279.52s)]
*  You stole that steak. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3280.88s)]
*  Yeah, I tried. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3282.52s)]
*  You couldn't get it. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3284.2s)]

*  Get on the flow. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3296.04s)]
*  He was unique, wasn't he? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3297.24s)]
*  The man right here. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3298.08s)]
*  He sing, he yelled all the fucking time. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3299.24s)]
*  He did, he was angry about something. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3301.52s)]
*  How do you feel about Post Malone? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3303.56s)]
*  It was a thing and I want to get your side [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3305.64s)]
*  where they feel like, this is from Charlamagne the God. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3307.24s)]
*  He said he felt like he came over and stole [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3310.16s)]
*  like the bad culture with the right Irish. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3312.7999999999997s)]
*  And then he went over and just changed [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3314.36s)]
*  and never made nothing for that. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3316.48s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3317.64s)]
*  Like, do you agree with him or disagree? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that that's silly for Charlamagne to say. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3320.68s)]
*  I think at this point, at some point we got to realize [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3322.68s)]
*  that there's, oh, I think there's been a lot [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3327.2799999999997s)]
*  of culture vultures over the years, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3329.0s)]
*  especially early on when black people didn't have [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3330.6s)]
*  a lot of rights to their music, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3334.2s)]
*  when they didn't even know about business. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3335.6s)]
*  Like even growing up poor and white, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3337.72s)]
*  like I've had to learn, I've made a lot of poor [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3339.6s)]
*  like business choice because I don't have anybody [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3342.04s)]
*  in my family doing anything about business. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3343.56s)]
*  Because you're just poor, so you made poor decisions. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3345.04s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3346.92s)]
*  Yeah, nobody was doing any business. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3347.76s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3349.04s)]
*  When you get rich, you start making rich decisions. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3349.88s)]
*  Yeah, and then you start to know other rich people, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3351.08s)]
*  they tell you shit, you know. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3353.0s)]
*  Charlamagne, I think kind of have a, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3355.52s)]
*  he seemed like, oh, he had a [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3358.6400000000003s)]
*  A troll? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3360.12s)]
*  A little bit, he seemed like a, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3361.48s)]
*  he have a kind of a womanly look. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3363.12s)]
*  He's beautiful. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3365.04s)]

*  You think that? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3367.12s)]
*  Who? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3370.76s)]
*  Charlamagne. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3371.6s)]
*  He's beautiful, you think he's beautiful? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3372.76s)]
*  I mean, I fuck with Megan and Stygian, she cute. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3374.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3377.52s)]
*  What if it was me and Charlamagne in a room? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3378.36s)]
*  Dude, you tell me Charlamagne ain't fine, bro. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3379.6800000000003s)]

*  You think that's a sex symbol? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  I think if you put a, if he was in Japan or [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3386.48s)]
*  A Wii 8? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=3390.0s)]

*  That's what I said, people worry about the negative [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4047.96s)]
*  and you forget about the positive. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4048.8s)]

*  if I'm learning how to be honest about talking about [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4076.0800000000004s)]
*  any thoughts I have about race stuff, anything like that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4079.32s)]

*  but then also they get to know the person, you know? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4097.68s)]
*  There's a lot of artists out there that people start [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4100.0s)]
*  to love the person. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4102.04s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4103.64s)]
*  It's almost like they supersede their own talent [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4104.4800000000005s)]
*  cause people are like, oh, I'll watch them almost [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4107.320000000001s)]

*  about them that I really like. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4111.8s)]
*  And sometimes people got no one likes camera action. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4113.400000000001s)]
*  Some people just show up for cameras [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4115.48s)]
*  and they ain't even know who they are. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4117.24s)]
*  So people will try to be like, oh, this and that. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4118.36s)]
*  And he shouldn't have said that. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4121.08s)]

*  I'm not putting the energy in to pay attention to it, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4139.12s)]

*  It's a bunch of loser guys that can't get girls [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4181.48s)]
*  and they listen to two guys [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4184.12s)]
*  and they just bring girls on the show to bash them. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4185.759999999999s)]
*  But I mean, I don't know what to call it. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4188.799999999999s)]
*  Like. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4192.16s)]
*  Oh, dang, that seems, is it kind of cold? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4193.0s)]
*  Or is it funny? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4196.599999999999s)]
*  It's funny moments on there. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4197.44s)]
*  But like I said, it's just how you, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4199.8s)]
*  I'm not a sensitive person. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4200.92s)]
*  Like if you're not comfortable on the show, fucking leave. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4202.08s)]
*  If you like me, I already put up a fight. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4204.16s)]
*  If you feel like they're bad assholes, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4206.52s)]
*  be asshole with them bad. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4207.68s)]
*  Like I'm a Metro energy and I'm embarrassed. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4208.52s)]
*  You like you trying to embarrass me. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4210.16s)]
*  So where do you see, you have a lot of good [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4211.4800000000005s)]
*  like kind of theories on your own behavior [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4212.8s)]
*  and ways to like kind of navigate yourself. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4214.64s)]
*  Where does some of that come from for you? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4217.04s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4219.84s)]
*  Actually just getting lack of attention as a child [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4220.68s)]
*  and just being the one that's counted last. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4223.360000000001s)]
*  So being counted last and always been the bottom [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4225.68s)]
*  is like, what the fuck can I do to get to the top? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4227.64s)]
*  And when I get to the top, I always remember when I was last. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4230.72s)]
*  So now I'm here, keep both of those energy. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4232.12s)]
*  It keep that shit equal. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4234.64s)]
*  So that's why I was just like, don't go overboard. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4236.0s)]
*  Don't go under board because at the end of the day, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4238.12s)]
*  it's gonna be people that was in my spot. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4240.04s)]
*  I want them to know we can get up here and be okay. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4242.0s)]

*  She got four different baby daddies. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4255.16s)]
*  She's not a hoe, but it's like, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4256.88s)]
*  I mean, in a hood that technically make you a hoe. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4259.04s)]

*  Man, that's crazy. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4819.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure there's some people out there. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4819.84s)]
*  I'm just not looking into it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4820.76s)]
*  I'm too busy looking at two fucking kangaroos [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4822.0s)]
*  to see how they fuck. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4823.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4825.5199999999995s)]
*  That's why I watch on my YouTube history. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4826.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, okay. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4827.719999999999s)]
*  So I can look into that, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4828.5599999999995s)]
*  but right now I wouldn't have the answer for it, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4829.639999999999s)]
*  and I wouldn't lie. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4831.04s)]
*  Black people, a lot of black men are good at sex, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4831.88s)]
*  I feel like. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4834.36s)]
*  That's a generalization. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4835.2s)]
*  Would you say that? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4836.04s)]
*  Yeah, sex symbols. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4836.88s)]
*  Do they? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4837.72s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't know because I haven't had sex [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4838.56s)]
*  with a black guy or any type of guy. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4840.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4843.0s)]
*  But if it's general speaking from women point of view, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4844.12s)]
*  yeah, they'll say that. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4848.04s)]
*  And I heard some girls say like white dudes [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4848.88s)]
*  and put it down too. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4851.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4852.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4853.2s)]
*  Okay, so there's some white guys that can do it, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4854.02s)]
*  and there's a lot of black guys that can do it. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4855.28s)]
*  Okay, that's a- [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4856.84s)]
*  It's even. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4857.68s)]

*  You think so? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4859.36s)]
*  I feel like a lot of shit even. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4860.2s)]
*  It's just certain people don't wanna hear it. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4861.44s)]
*  It's some of the stereotypes. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4862.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4864.12s)]
*  But here's what I'm saying. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4864.96s)]
*  Do I feel like, do you ever look at animals fucking [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4866.04s)]
*  and think, oh, I could do that? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4870.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I wanna be a snapping turtle. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4872.599999999999s)]
*  I wanna see how turtles fuck. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4874.12s)]

*  That's gotta be slow. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4880.599999999999s)]
*  Before we go, I wanna say that I feel like sometimes [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4882.0s)]
*  squirrels do commit suicide [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4885.12s)]
*  because there's no way they should get hit by a car [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdBvMeOQOg&t=4886.88s)]
