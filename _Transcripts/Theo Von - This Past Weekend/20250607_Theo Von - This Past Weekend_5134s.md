# Vice President JD Vance | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #588
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw)
*  I've got some tour dates to tell you about. I'll be in Cedar Rapids, St. Paul, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota, Rapid City, South Dakota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Rochester, New York, and Detroit, Michigan, all in June and July. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tickets available now at theovon.com. Thank you so much for your support. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=16.0s)]
*  Today's guest is the Vice President of the United States of America. He was previously a Senator from the state of Ohio before winning the presidency with Donald Trump in 2024. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=23.0s)]
*  We are coming to you from Nashville, Tennessee, from the Detroit Cowboy, a new restaurant here. I'm grateful for his return to our podcast. Today's guest is Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=34.0s)]
*  I'm not, I don't care at all. Look, we believe in the First Amendment. If the Secret Service has to hit me, hit me hard, brother. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=53.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? And hit two other people. I want a class action suit. Oh, holy shit. Look, there's a there's a literal lion right there. Like a lion scan. I hadn't seen. Have you noticed that before? No, I think it's is that a lion or it's a sorry. I know we're supposed to start this. No, it's okay. No, you're good. I'm just as hand signals and stuff going on on my group. I'm just trying to get everybody to chill out so I can. Okay. Yeah, this is no my bad. Fuck. Now I ruined everything, dude. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=74.0s)]
*  We had a really good vibe going. You just totally. It's like my childhood, dude. I just something I said right out of the gate ruined it. That's what my mom said to me when I was like something you said to me right when I met you really ruined our relationship. And I'm like when I was what? Eleven months old. Your mom said that to you. Yeah, she's just kind of a she's a mid. You know, she's just a good grudge holder and she's Midwestern. She's got a good grip on it. Yeah, my mom's a good grudge holder, too. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=102.0s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think that she's ever held anything that I said in 11 months against her. That's pretty mean. That's tough, man. Your mom is the chief. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=132.0s)]
*  Oh, she wins, man. She definitely wins. Yeah, this is Kid Rock's place, dude. Yeah, it's cool. There's a line over there that I don't think people can see. There's two foxes over there. You would love this place is my kids. Oh, dude. Kid Rock is one of the frickin. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=143.0s)]
*  He is definitely a damn piss lizard. He is a beautiful guy. He's a good dude. He's definitely the kind of guy I feel like he would sing it like. I'm trying to think what would you have Kid Rock sing at? I know like a concert, but I'm trying to think of a different type of event or something. I mean, he could sing in the orchestra or not. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=159.0s)]
*  No opera. Okay, my wife now because of the vice president, she's on the board of the Kennedy Center. We could bring Kid Rock to sing in the opera. Really? Yeah. Oh, wow. That's gonna be interesting. Oh, you gotta fume. You gotta fume a gate that place after. That's all I'm saying, dude. Just because. So my cousin, her one request from the campaign is that she wanted to party with Kid Rock. And I feel kind of bad. I didn't bring her. I brought her. You remember the first time we did your podcast, and we were talking about this. And she said, I can't wait to see it. And I said, I can't wait to see it. And I said, I can't wait to see it. And she said, I can't wait to see it. And I said, I can't wait to see it. And I said, I can't wait to see it. And she said, I can't wait to see it. And I said, I [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=176.0s)]
*  guess my cousin is with me. Oh, yeah. I met her. She's blonde, right? Yeah. Yeah. She's good people. And she said, I really want to party with Kid Rock. She said she wanted to party with Kid Rock and Hunter Biden. And unfortunately, I haven't made either one of those happen yet, but we'll see. There's a lot of time left. Wow. I don't know if there's that much time left for either one of those guys, though. That's really what I would. What were we talking about? Where we started, dude? Oh, yeah. You saw that hand thing never by Huberman. I did see this. Yeah. Who was like, what's his name? Huberman, Andrew Huberman. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. He's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=206.0s)]
*  And the problem was, another doctor told me we might have had our hand backwards. There's like a millions of people in America doing like a potentially like homoerotic test on themselves based on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=236.0s)]
*  Okay. So it's your index finger is supposed to be longer than your ring finger, right? I think I'm not sure. Yes. That's how mine is. Okay. Is my mean like my pointer finger is longer than my look. I'm just saying there's a lot of guys afraid to get out of their truck at work today. Probably. You know, that's all I'm saying. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=248.0s)]
*  I mean, there are because I mean, millions of people watch your podcast. There are probably hundreds of thousands of dudes, maybe more. You stare at their hand and we're like, oh, no. Oh, I saw one guy pulled his finger out of socket just a lot of his wife again. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=264.92s)]
*  I mean, these are the steps people are going to, especially with this health care. Yeah. I mean, you got to do what you can. I'm like, dude, you're going to put that back in yourself, you know? Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=280.92s)]
*  I don't think it works like that. Right. The the causality. I think if you like jerk your finger out of the socket doesn't really change anything other than you have a broken finger. I don't look man. I'm judging. Of course, all every, you know, live and let live. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=291.84s)]
*  If you're a gay guy, I think if you can put you, you've put more than your finger back inside, you know, I'm saying you can handle that. That's all I'm saying. So that right there, I think is a good test. I think my great, great grandfather. I'm not sure if he was gay, but people thought he was gay or whatever. Just from the pictures of him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=305.76s)]
*  Your great, great, great grandfather. Yeah. Man. I don't think I know anything about my great, great, great grandfather. Well, I fought the Civil War. He did. Probably for both sides. I bet on you know what I'm talking about. Okay. So there's a database. There's actually there's a website. I think it's like an American history or Smithsonian. Somebody keeps up a database where you can go in and type your name and you can see how many people with your last name fought in the Civil War. Hell yeah. And I did that on both sides of my head. I thought I was going to end up in a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=320.68s)]
*  family. Mom and dad side. It was kind of crazy how many answer how many people with the same name at least fought in the Civil War. Oh, I'm sure. But on but on I mean like on both sides, some Confederates or some union. Yeah. Who would you have fought for you think? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=350.68s)]
*  I'm joking. We're not going to start there. I'm a big fan of Abraham Lincoln. I would have I would have fought. I would have fought for the union. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=363.88s)]
*  It's interesting, man. So the you go back in time to like even so when I grew up, right, the story that we told I grew up in southern Ohio and the story that sort of we took learned in Ohio history and American history was basically the union was the union side was right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=369.68s)]
*  But you know we're all part of the same team after the Civil War. We all came together shook hands and you know, kumbaya, and you can even like respect the other side, even if you didn't necessarily agree with what they were fighting for. Yeah. And I feel like something happened like 10 years ago where every you have to think that every single person who fought for the Confederate side was an evil person. I just think that's so stupid. Yeah. Well, I think I know there was a time when they tore down all the statues and stuff, and it's like a lot of the history. I think a lot of people would be at debate about the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=389.68s)]
*  value of erasing history, you know? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=419.68s)]
*  It's like, because it feels like it's there for a purpose [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=421.92s)]
*  and it feels like it deserves to be there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=424.44s)]
*  Even though like later on in life you might be, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=426.04s)]
*  or later on in time, people might be like ashamed of it [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=428.8s)]
*  or think of it differently, right? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=431.2s)]
*  It feels like it at least earned its place in existence. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  So did you ever see this, there's this documentary [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=436.12s)]
*  on the Civil War by Ken Burns, it was on PBS. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  It's got like the really sad violin music [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=442.08s)]
*  and I actually met the couple that composed that song [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=444.44s)]
*  from the Ken Burns documentary. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=447.92s)]
*  It's a beautiful song, honestly. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=449.92s)]
*  Yeah, but it seems sad as hell to sitting around [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=451.92s)]
*  with your wife all day listening to that shit. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=453.76s)]
*  Good God. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=455.56s)]
*  Let's just, let's sit here and listen to all five minutes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=457.32s)]
*  of it in total silence, me and you and all these producers. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=460.0s)]
*  Look, I, so my wife who, you know, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=463.8s)]
*  her family came from South India and then immigrated [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=467.6s)]
*  and then she was born in San Diego. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=471.04s)]
*  Like I watched that documentary with my wife, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=473.0s)]
*  actually I think when we were still dating, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=476.08s)]
*  weren't even married yet. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=477.44s)]
*  And it's like such a good summary of everything [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=478.8s)]
*  that happened in the Civil War. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  And you get this sense it's sad and it's heartbreaking, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=483.88s)]
*  you know, they read letters from some guy home to his family [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=486.32s)]
*  and it's just, it captures the tragedy of the Civil War. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=489.56s)]
*  And my wife made this point actually a few years ago, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=493.76s)]
*  she was like, if you showed that documentary, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=495.92s)]
*  maybe not now, but like at the height of the woke thing, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  so call it 2021, you show that documentary in 2021, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=501.44s)]
*  there are a lot of things they would try [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=504.88s)]
*  to cancel Ken Burns over. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=506.12s)]
*  Because, you know, like a Confederate soldier [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  wrote a letter home and it's sad and it's tragic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=510.56s)]
*  and you try to empathize with that person. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=513.76s)]
*  And that was, that's like, that wasn't okay in 2021. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=515.92s)]
*  And I think that's actually one of the best things [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=519.32s)]
*  that's happened in the country the last few years [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=521.2s)]
*  is people are just done filtering themselves [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=523.92s)]
*  and they're done like being canceled [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=527.04s)]
*  or being afraid to say what's on their mind. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=529.96s)]
*  Like that's a good thing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=531.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point, man. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  Dude, I'll tell you this, I heard that Frederick Douglass [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=533.76s)]
*  I heard Frederick Douglass was gay. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I swear. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=541.7199999999999s)]
*  Who told you that? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=543.0s)]
*  I've heard it from probably almost 15, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  not 15 people, I've heard it from four people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  Where do you go to find the people who tell you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=547.76s)]
*  that Frederick Douglass is gay? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  Look, I'll tell you this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=551.88s)]
*  You must hang out more interesting places than I do. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't white people that told me. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  Really? Okay. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=555.64s)]
*  So out of the gate, I have given a little bit [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  more credibility and that's why he wanted to free [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=558.12s)]
*  all those men because he was having trouble [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  meeting anybody. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=561.56s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  Because everybody was at work. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=564.56s)]

*  he compartmentalizes things very well. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=688.4s)]
*  So he just doesn't get like really stressed out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=690.84s)]
*  He's very stoic about everything, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=692.72s)]
*  Whereas I was a little bit more nervous. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=694.4s)]

*  Oh, give him a hug for me. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=727.76s)]
*  So we're watching the election returns, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=728.68s)]

*  There's a whole data apparatus [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=736.52s)]
*  that is feeding information into the central campaign. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=739.12s)]
*  So whatever the media's reporting on, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=742.24s)]
*  we're 15 minutes ahead of time. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=744.2s)]
*  And we're asking questions like, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=746.32s)]
*  oh, there's this, I'll never forget this, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=747.76s)]
*  there's this one little county in Indiana [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=749.2s)]
*  that produced election results early. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=751.92s)]
*  And we were like, oh my God, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=754.5s)]
*  we did so much better in that county [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=756.12s)]
*  than we did in 2020 or even 2016. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=758.08s)]
*  And so that's a pretty good sign. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  And what happened is, as these counties trickle in, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=763.64s)]
*  you realize we're doing way better than we did [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=765.9s)]
*  even in 2016. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=767.82s)]
*  Like, oh my God, Donald Trump's gonna be the president, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=769.34s)]
*  and I'm gonna be the vice president of the United States. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=771.5400000000001s)]
*  And that was nuts. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=773.0600000000001s)]
*  And I was there as actually with my wife. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=774.6800000000001s)]
*  What'd you do? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=779.34s)]
*  Did you put your hands in your pockets [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  or what'd you even do? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=781.0s)]
*  I don't know what I did with my hands, man. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=783.1s)]
*  I was, it was like, you know, the Talladega nights, right? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=784.46s)]
*  I'm just not sure what to do with my hands all night. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=788.58s)]
*  So we go over to the hotel [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=790.98s)]
*  where they're doing like the victory celebration. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=792.44s)]
*  And I'm there with like Don Jr. and Tucker Carlson [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=794.1800000000001s)]
*  and a few other people who's sort of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=797.9399999999999s)]
*  in the world of politics. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=798.78s)]
*  And they called Pennsylvania. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=800.22s)]
*  And I didn't realize that, like the TV called Pennsylvania. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=802.26s)]
*  And I didn't realize that I was just talking to my wife [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=806.14s)]
*  and the crowd goes wild. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=808.3s)]
*  So you hear people cheering and I'm like, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=810.1s)]
*  what the hell happened? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=811.64s)]
*  And I look over at the TV, I'm like, oh my God, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=812.48s)]
*  it's official. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=814.78s)]
*  And that was one of the craziest moments of my life. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=816.06s)]
*  God. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=818.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=819.02s)]
*  The feeling at that moment, one, it was incredible. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=820.34s)]
*  But then you have this overwhelming sense of like, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=823.46s)]
*  oh my God, we're the dog that caught the car, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=825.86s)]
*  And now you have to do a good job. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=828.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=831.62s)]
*  And it's not like some random job. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=832.46s)]
*  It's like a really important job. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=835.2600000000001s)]
*  And so I just have this kind of sense of, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=836.7s)]
*  oh my God, this is real now. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=838.1400000000001s)]

*  Because if Trump stays, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=852.22s)]
*  if the president stays in the White House, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=853.34s)]

*  You have an open invitation. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=857.9399999999999s)]
*  The president actually gives me crap about this [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=859.6999999999999s)]
*  because he says, sometimes I think you have a nicer house [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=861.66s)]
*  than I do. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=863.5s)]
*  We stay at a place we call the VPR, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=864.3399999999999s)]
*  the vice president's residence, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=865.8199999999999s)]
*  but it's in the Naval Observatory. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=867.06s)]
*  So we've got like probably 40 or so acres [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=868.98s)]
*  of completely private space. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=871.98s)]
*  In an observatory? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=873.66s)]
*  Yeah, and across the street. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=874.5s)]
*  You give me a damn peeping Tom, huh? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=877.18s)]
*  No, no. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=878.38s)]
*  Bring me in, dude. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=879.38s)]
*  Peeping Tom on stars and- [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  Dude, I got a small ladder. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=882.42s)]
*  I'll set that whole neighborhood ablaze. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=883.66s)]
*  Dude, nobody will buy a new bra in that neighborhood [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=886.18s)]
*  without me knowing it, dude. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=887.98s)]
*  I swear to God, brother. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=888.9399999999999s)]
*  The telescopes are pointed towards the stars. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=890.86s)]
*  But anyway, so we live there. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=895.54s)]
*  So we got three little kids and like I said, a dog. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=897.34s)]
*  Wow, that's so cool. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=899.5s)]
*  It's very cool. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=900.34s)]
*  So we did actually, so a couple of weeks ago, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=901.18s)]
*  the president invited me and my wife. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=904.06s)]
*  We had a, I think it was my stepmom was in town [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=905.98s)]
*  and the president invited me and my wife [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=909.62s)]
*  to stay in the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=911.06s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's like really cool. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=913.34s)]
*  Of course I wanna go stay at the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=914.98s)]
*  So apparently though, a vice president had never stayed [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=916.42s)]
*  at the White House with the president before. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=919.98s)]
*  And so the Secret Service wasn't totally sure what to do [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=922.3s)]
*  because they didn't have like the processes. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=924.42s)]
*  But yeah, we went to the White House. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=926.34s)]
*  We stayed at the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=927.5s)]
*  He don't stay up late? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=929.02s)]
*  We did actually, but because it was kind of scary, right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=930.38s)]
*  I mean, you're like laying in the room. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=933.22s)]
*  There's a desk where, you know, the president's like, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=934.46s)]
*  that's the desk where Lincoln wrote [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=936.5799999999999s)]
*  the Emancipation Proclamation. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=938.42s)]
*  Like I thought it would be cooler and more fun, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=940.22s)]
*  but you're kind of just laying in there and it's like, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=943.94s)]
*  you know, there are ghosts. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=945.5s)]
*  It feels like there's ghosts everywhere. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=946.38s)]
*  It's just a kind of a creepy feeling [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=948.26s)]
*  to be in the literal bedroom of Abraham Lincoln. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=950.94s)]
*  When you think about it, that dude went [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=953.78s)]
*  to the Ford's theater to go see a play, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=955.74s)]
*  left that room, but never came back, right? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=957.38s)]
*  That's creepy stuff. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=959.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=961.5400000000001s)]
*  Dang dude. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=962.38s)]
*  Speaking Frederick Douglass. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=963.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=964.74s)]
*  We've come full circle. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=965.58s)]
*  Look, I'll just say this. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  There's photos when he was signing that, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=968.54s)]
*  you saw Frederick in the distance, just biggest smile. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=970.5799999999999s)]
*  Biggest smile in the joint. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=974.9399999999999s)]
*  So damn, you slept, so you might be the first vice president [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=977.78s)]
*  that ever slept in the White House? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=980.2199999999999s)]
*  That's what they told us. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=981.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't want, you know, that's, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=982.0999999999999s)]
*  maybe it had happened like 30 years ago, but. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=983.18s)]
*  Did y'all stay up late with the Trumps [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=985.8199999999999s)]
*  and watch a movie or anything? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=987.0999999999999s)]
*  Like what did you got, play a game or anything? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=988.06s)]
*  So the White House is a movie theater. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=989.6999999999999s)]
*  The president was busy, but my wife and I [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=991.26s)]
*  wouldn't watch Gladiator 2 in the White House movie theater. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=993.3s)]
*  Oh! [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=995.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=996.74s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=997.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=998.4200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't as good as Gladiator 1, I think. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=999.4200000000001s)]
*  That's just one man's opinion. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1001.26s)]
*  Yeah, but it's way better [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1002.3000000000001s)]
*  when you're the vice president watching it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1003.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1004.34s)]
*  In the White House movie theater. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1005.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh dude, it's shitty, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1007.5s)]
*  but if you're the vice president watching it, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1008.98s)]
*  when you get to the end of the movie, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1011.4200000000001s)]
*  you're still the vice president. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1012.7800000000001s)]
*  You're still the vice president. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1014.1s)]
*  So that's pretty dope, dude. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1014.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1015.9000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, we stayed up late, watched the movie. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1017.46s)]
*  The food's really good. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1019.6600000000001s)]
*  So there's like a fancy chef at the White House. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1020.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's the White House. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1023.0600000000001s)]
*  And he stays up all night? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1023.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know how late he stays, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1025.06s)]
*  but if you order anything at any time of night, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1026.46s)]
*  they will just bring it to you. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1029.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1030.26s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1031.1000000000001s)]
*  I gotta get there. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1031.94s)]
*  Thankfully, at least we're at Kid Rock's bar. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1032.78s)]
*  So you know what I'm saying? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1036.9s)]

*  And he graced us by letting us have this room here [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1050.3s)]

*  also known as Kid Rock, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1055.82s)]
*  for letting us have this beautiful space. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1056.86s)]
*  He told me it had only been open for two days. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1058.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1060.74s)]
*  I didn't realize that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1061.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I was here at a fricking welcome party or something. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1063.24s)]
*  I was here last night. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1065.02s)]

*  The welcoming party, which was last night, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1071.74s)]
*  because it's only been open for two days. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1073.1s)]
*  It's good. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1074.5s)]
*  So how was the food? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1075.7s)]
*  The food, I will say this actually, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1076.78s)]
*  there's steaks that they have these little bitty mushrooms. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1078.1799999999998s)]
*  And I feel like they were, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1080.5s)]
*  I don't want to say this out loud, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1081.78s)]
*  but they were too young to be picked or whatever. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1082.82s)]
*  But it was really good. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1085.02s)]
*  It's good? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1087.06s)]
*  Really, really good. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1087.9s)]
*  I had high expectations. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1088.74s)]

*  And I thought this was going to be on Iran. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1106.02s)]
*  I haven't even seen. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1108.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1109.1399999999999s)]
*  I haven't even seen this one. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1109.98s)]
*  But he goes, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1110.8s)]
*  at real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the real reason they have not been made public. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1113.62s)]
*  Have a nice day. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1115.82s)]
*  Nice signature from a South African DJT. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1117.06s)]
*  Man. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1119.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, so just so your audience is aware, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1121.26s)]
*  when was this going to air? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1124.82s)]
*  Like tomorrow or two days from now? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1125.9799999999998s)]
*  It's airing 45 minutes now, dude. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1127.5s)]
*  No, I'm joking. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1128.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1129.7399999999998s)]
*  I'm just saying like, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1130.58s)]
*  presumably when this comes out, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1132.3s)]
*  people are going to know more about this [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1133.6599999999999s)]
*  than I do because this kind of happened on the plane [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1134.86s)]
*  when I was coming on down here. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1138.3s)]
*  I agree. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1139.34s)]
*  This is new. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1140.1799999999998s)]
*  Here's my basic reaction to like all this stuff is look. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1142.7s)]
*  First of all, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  like absolutely not. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1147.66s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1149.5800000000002s)]
*  Like there's, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1151.8200000000002s)]
*  the guy is, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1153.6200000000001s)]
*  whatever the Democrats and the media says about him, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1155.5s)]
*  that's totally BS. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1157.5800000000002s)]
*  Here's my basic, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1158.66s)]
*  my basic read on it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  First of all, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1160.94s)]
*  I'm the vice president to President Trump. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1161.94s)]
*  My loyalties are always going to be with the president. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1163.54s)]
*  And I think that Elon, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1165.9s)]
*  he's an incredible entrepreneur. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1168.22s)]
*  He's actually done a, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1169.8600000000001s)]
*  I think Doge was really good. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1170.82s)]
*  This sort of effort to root out waste, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  fraud and abuse in our country is really good. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1174.3s)]
*  And look, man, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1176.42s)]
*  I'm always going to be loyal to the president. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1178.06s)]
*  And I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1180.26s)]
*  into the fold. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1182.86s)]
*  Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1183.94s)]
*  But I hope it is, man. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1186.7s)]
*  It's feeling to hurt. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1187.54s)]
*  Why though? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1188.7s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1189.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1191.2s)]
*  so look, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1192.04s)]
*  I think number one, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1193.18s)]
*  so, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1194.74s)]
*  Elon's new to politics, right? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1197.1399999999999s)]
*  So his businesses are being attacked nonstop. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1198.76s)]
*  They're literally like firebombing some of his cars. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1202.24s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1204.24s)]
*  we're looking into a lot of the stuff. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1205.08s)]
*  I mean, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1206.0s)]
*  some of that stuff we're looking into is an act of terrorism [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1206.84s)]
*  at the department of justice, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1208.56s)]
*  because I think it is an act of terrorism. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1209.68s)]
*  So I think part of it is this guy got into politics [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1211.12s)]
*  and has suffered a lot for it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1214.36s)]
*  But I mean, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1216.72s)]
*  and I get the frustration there [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1218.2s)]
*  and I get the frustration that, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1220.12s)]
*  I mean, look, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1221.06s)]
*  Congress got the spending bill, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1221.9s)]
*  but the main purpose of the bill is not actually spending [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1224.08s)]
*  or cutting spending, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1226.44s)]
*  though it does cut a lot of spending. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1227.3200000000002s)]
*  The main purpose of the bill is to prevent [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  the biggest tax increase. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1230.56s)]
*  But I understand like it's a good bill. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1232.0s)]
*  It's not a perfect bill. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1233.44s)]
*  Like the process in DC, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1234.5800000000002s)]
*  if you're a business leader, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1236.38s)]
*  you probably get frustrated with that process [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1237.42s)]
*  because it's more bureaucratic. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1239.04s)]
*  It's more slow moving. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1240.96s)]
*  So I think there's just some frustrations there, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1242.28s)]
*  but I really, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1245.14s)]
*  man, I think it's a huge mistake for him [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1246.3400000000001s)]
*  to go after the president like that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1247.64s)]
*  And I think that if he and the president [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1248.96s)]
*  are in some blood feud, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1253.0800000000002s)]
*  most importantly, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1254.52s)]
*  it's gonna be bad for the country. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  But I think it's gonna be, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1256.88s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be good for Elon either. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1257.88s)]
*  But Elon, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1259.7s)]
*  like did those, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1260.54s)]
*  first of all, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1261.68s)]
*  my first thought was that it's a ruse, right? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1262.52s)]
*  Cause there's a lot of times where the media [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1263.76s)]
*  will put out a ruse or they'll use somebody like, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1265.4s)]
*  I think the ditty thing is a ruse. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1267.64s)]
*  Like it's like, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1269.16s)]
*  hey, like diverse community, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1270.0s)]
*  stay busy with this shit. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1271.56s)]
*  While we like move all these chess pieces, right? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1273.32s)]
*  Sometimes that's what I feel like it is. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1275.56s)]
*  And maybe I'm like a pervert or whatever, sorry. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1277.0s)]
*  Or weird guy, sorry. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1279.84s)]
*  But, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1281.66s)]
*  this has nothing to do with that, huh? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1282.72s)]
*  Maybe you're a weird guy. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1285.1599999999999s)]
*  You're not a pervert. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1286.0s)]
*  I think you're a good dude. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1286.82s)]
*  You're a good dude. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1287.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that dude. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1288.5s)]
*  But anyway, what I was saying was. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1289.32s)]
*  But that ditty thing, man, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  is it true they found like, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  sorry, not to play into this, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  but I read somewhere that they found like bottles [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1296.02s)]
*  and bottles and bottles. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1299.32s)]
*  Maybe you told me this. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1300.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1302.96s)]
*  Somebody told me, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1303.8s)]
*  bottles and bottles of like baby oil, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1304.62s)]
*  but that had like drugs in it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1305.72s)]
*  Bring that up. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1308.0s)]
*  Was they doping up their baby oil? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1308.84s)]
*  Is that real or is that just something I heard [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1309.6599999999999s)]
*  on the internet? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  Cause sometimes you hear stuff on the internet, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1311.72s)]
*  it's not true. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1312.84s)]
*  Most of it is. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1314.24s)]
*  Most of the stuff you hear on the internet. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1315.4s)]
*  What defense would you have? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1317.64s)]
*  Like babies that are addicted to dirty oil? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1318.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you don't normally have GHB in baby oil. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1321.04s)]
*  GHB oil. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1324.04s)]
*  Like I'm not a doctor, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1324.88s)]
*  but I don't think that's a normal ingredient in GHB. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1325.7s)]
*  Anyway, sorry. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1327.88s)]
*  I mean, look now. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1328.72s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1330.1200000000001s)]
*  There's some babies these days [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1330.96s)]
*  that fucking want to get to the club, homie. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1332.44s)]
*  No. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1335.98s)]
*  But no, but. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1337.44s)]
*  So do you think it was. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1338.88s)]
*  So obviously it was the bill. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1340.04s)]
*  This is where it's happened. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1341.54s)]
*  Something about the bill made him upset. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1342.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1345.56s)]
*  So yeah, that's right. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1346.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1347.24s)]
*  I mean, again, I think he looked at the bill. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1348.08s)]
*  He didn't like it. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1349.76s)]
*  And I think it's a good bill. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1351.48s)]
*  But again, there are things you can criticize about it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1353.12s)]
*  Like the president would be very open and say, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1355.52s)]
*  this is not a perfect bill. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1357.72s)]
*  But Donald Trump doesn't get to write the bills, right? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1359.4s)]
*  Congress has to write the bills. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1361.42s)]
*  And you got to work with them to try to get something [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1362.8s)]
*  that is as good as possible. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1364.52s)]
*  So here's what I'll say about the bill. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1366.12s)]
*  Number one, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1367.36s)]
*  prevents the biggest tax increase in American history. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1368.2s)]
*  It prevents it? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1370.56s)]
*  Prevents it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1371.4s)]
*  Taxes are going to go up on everybody [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1372.24s)]
*  in a really big way at the end of 2025, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1373.84s)]
*  because the old tax law expires at the end of 2025. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1376.48s)]
*  So you're going to hit a big tax increase. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1379.68s)]
*  We're trying to prevent that from happening. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1381.76s)]
*  We're also trying to do stuff. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1383.44s)]
*  Okay, so you got a lot of people working long overtime hours [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1384.52s)]
*  in this economy. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1387.4s)]
*  You know, we inherited bad inflation from Joe Biden. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  So no tax on overtime, no tax on tips, right? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1391.52s)]
*  We're in Bob Richie, we're in Kid Rock's great restaurant. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1394.8s)]
*  His servers would not have to pay taxes [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1397.8s)]
*  on the hard earned tips that they get [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1399.6s)]
*  when they're busting their ass doing a good job. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1401.6599999999999s)]
*  So when working for Kid Rock, man, that's hard work, right? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1403.26s)]
*  So I think that it's a good bill [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1407.1s)]
*  and it does a lot of good for the American people. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1409.62s)]
*  But like, look, Elon's entitled to his opinion. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1411.62s)]
*  I'm not saying he has to agree with the bill [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1413.34s)]
*  or agree with everything that I'm saying. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1415.54s)]
*  I just think it's a huge mistake [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1417.22s)]
*  for the world's wealthiest man, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1419.3s)]
*  I think one of the most transformational entrepreneurs ever, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1421.6599999999999s)]
*  that's Elon, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1424.18s)]
*  to be at this war with the world's most powerful man, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1425.1399999999999s)]
*  who I think is doing more to save the country [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1429.98s)]
*  than anybody, and I'm 40 years old, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1432.3s)]
*  anybody in my lifetime. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1434.42s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1435.5s)]
*  It's a guy who, not even a year ago, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1436.7s)]
*  nearly took a bullet in the process of campaigning, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1439.64s)]
*  went back on the horse the next day. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1442.92s)]
*  And if you look, obviously I'm biased, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1445.44s)]
*  but you look at what we've done on the border, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1447.14s)]
*  you look at what we've done with trade, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1448.8600000000001s)]
*  fighting back against a generation of theft [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1450.3s)]
*  of the American dream, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1452.9s)]
*  which is what the president's trade policies [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1454.46s)]
*  are starting to do. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1456.5s)]
*  I just think you gotta have some respect for him [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1458.0s)]
*  and say, look, yeah, we don't have to agree on every issue. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1460.32s)]
*  I'm talking about, if you're Elon Musk, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1462.36s)]
*  you don't have to agree with us on every issue, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1463.68s)]
*  but is this war actually in the interest of the country? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1465.58s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1468.86s)]
*  So hopefully, Elon figures it out, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1469.7s)]
*  comes back into the fold. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1472.44s)]
*  I know the president, for a couple days, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1473.92s)]
*  I'll tell you, I just, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1476.72s)]
*  I don't wanna reveal too many confidences, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1477.56s)]
*  but he was getting a little frustrated, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1479.2s)]
*  feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1481.12s)]
*  coming from Elon, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1483.6s)]
*  but I think it's been very restrained, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1484.88s)]
*  because the president doesn't think [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1486.88s)]
*  that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1489.64s)]
*  and I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1492.4s)]
*  everything would be fine. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1495.3200000000002s)]
*  It would help. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1496.16s)]
*  Well, Elon also tweeted that he thought that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1496.98s)]
*  in the second half of this year, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1498.8000000000002s)]
*  that there would be a, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1500.48s)]
*  the Trump tariffs will cause a recession [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1503.5200000000002s)]
*  in the second half of this year. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1505.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, who knows what could cause a recession [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1508.3600000000001s)]
*  in the second half of this year? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  It could be a buildup of our entire history of being alive, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1511.2s)]
*  but he's saying this. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  So it seems like, and this is just me guessing, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  and I don't know Mr. Musk. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1520.8000000000002s)]
*  I never met Mr. Musk. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1521.76s)]
*  One time he fed my buddy spaghetti at a party, though, dude, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1523.28s)]
*  that my buddy, they were, people were raging and shit. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1525.96s)]
*  Your buddy couldn't feed himself spaghetti? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1530.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, my buddy said, he offered my buddy some spaghetti, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1531.92s)]
*  and my buddy said, yeah, I'd like to have some, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1534.48s)]
*  and then instead- But only if you feed it to him. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1536.28s)]
*  But instead of getting him a plate of spaghetti, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1537.8400000000001s)]
*  he made himself and put it in his mouth, dude. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1540.96s)]
*  Does your buddy know Frederick Douglass? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1543.36s)]
*  My buddy, I'll say this. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1545.76s)]
*  My buddy actually is a friend of FDR. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1547.6s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1549.76s)]
*  That's a terrible- Sorry, of, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1550.76s)]
*  shit, I don't know. Frederick. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1553.9199999999998s)]
*  God, dude. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1555.0s)]
*  I'll fucking ruin this shit, dude. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1555.84s)]
*  Fuck, dude, civics, man, chill out. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1558.36s)]
*  No, but he said that he thinks he did, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1562.12s)]
*  but do you think that he just thinks that there's too many, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  that it's not a fair bill for the people? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1567.7s)]
*  Do you think Elon Musk is for the people? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1569.06s)]
*  I mean, I think that he's making a mistake [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1571.8s)]
*  and going after the president. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1574.0s)]
*  But I think his heart is in the right place, man. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1574.84s)]
*  I do. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1577.24s)]
*  I think he got into this for the right reasons. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1578.08s)]
*  I think he's frustrated. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  I think he's an emotional guy. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1581.2s)]
*  Honestly, I'm a very emotional guy. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1582.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1583.96s)]
*  It's the president, it's interesting, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1584.8s)]
*  because if you read the media reports, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1588.04s)]
*  you wouldn't necessarily see this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1590.0s)]
*  He's not quick to temper. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1591.84s)]
*  He's not one of these guys who flies off the handle. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1594.84s)]
*  That's a little bit more what I'm like, honestly. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1596.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, he's smooth. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1599.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think that's, he's smooth, man. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1600.0s)]
*  He's stoic. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1600.92s)]
*  His blood pressure's fucking 007, dude. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1601.7600000000002s)]
*  That motherfucker is. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1603.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if that's good. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1605.3200000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I get what you're saying. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  But it is where it is. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1608.48s)]
*  But I think, so yeah, I think Elon means the best, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1611.0s)]
*  but I think he's making a mistake. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1615.16s)]
*  Yeah, got it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1616.2s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1617.0400000000002s)]
*  Did any, was Doge helpful? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1618.92s)]
*  It was. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1621.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1622.18s)]
*  And I mean, look, Doge continues within the White House [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1623.0200000000002s)]
*  and within the executive of the country. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1625.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, look, there's a lot of ways in which we are wasting [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1628.68s)]
*  the American people's money. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes spending it on crazy stuff. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1633.5600000000002s)]
*  Sometimes spending it on actually counterproductive stuff. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1635.8400000000001s)]
*  I think Doge saved already at least 170, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1638.96s)]
*  maybe $200 billion. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1641.3200000000002s)]
*  Hopefully it's gonna save more. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1643.3200000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I think it was very worthwhile. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1645.44s)]
*  That's so much money. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1647.28s)]
*  That's a ton of money. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1648.1200000000001s)]
*  How do they not, how would you not even notice that? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1648.96s)]
*  If that much money. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1652.44s)]
*  There's so much I could tell you about this. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1653.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so one of the crazy things we all figured out [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1655.3200000000002s)]
*  the first week or so we're in the White House, okay, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1657.84s)]
*  is there was a payment that should be stopped [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1660.56s)]
*  because the president signed an executive order [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1664.08s)]
*  to stop a payment. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is like day one of the White House, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1667.36s)]
*  we're like, okay, how do we stop this payment? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1669.56s)]
*  Because somebody is trying to make this payment. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1671.8s)]
*  And nobody knew where like the computer was [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1673.44s)]
*  that actually wired the money [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1676.0s)]
*  from the US taxpayer to this entity. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1677.84s)]
*  God. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1680.04s)]
*  The amount of waste and the amount of just grift [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  in the federal government was off the charts. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1684.6s)]
*  It's getting better, but there's still a lot more [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1688.04s)]
*  I think we can find. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1690.12s)]
*  Who was getting it all? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1691.28s)]
*  I don't know one person that was getting something extra, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1692.12s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1695.6s)]
*  Unless everybody was slurping on it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1696.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people were slurping, man. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  You look at what, so for example, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1699.6399999999999s)]
*  there are all these humanitarian programs that we have [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1704.12s)]
*  where we send money for people for medicine, for food. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1706.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1708.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay, but like you think, I think, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1709.28s)]
*  like what I thought before I got in the government, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1712.1999999999998s)]
*  what most Americans think is okay, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1714.0s)]
*  so we send $100,000 to this group to buy food [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1716.04s)]
*  for like poor kids in Africa, okay? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1721.2s)]
*  And what actually happens is it's not $100,000 [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1723.8s)]
*  that go to the food for the poor kids in Africa. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1726.3999999999999s)]
*  That the NGO, the non-government organization [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1728.96s)]
*  that gets that money contracts it out to somebody else. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1732.12s)]
*  Right, so there's a middle man. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  And they subcontract it out to somebody else. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1736.24s)]
*  There's a middle man. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1737.08s)]
*  There's like three or four middle men. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1737.8999999999999s)]
*  And what Marco Rubio, who's the secretary of state, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1739.56s)]
*  he's a very good friend. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1741.76s)]
*  What he told me is that his best estimate [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1743.12s)]
*  after he had his team look at it [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1745.5600000000002s)]
*  is that 88 cents of every dollar [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1746.96s)]
*  was actually being collected by middlemen. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1749.2800000000002s)]
*  No way. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1751.88s)]
*  So every dollar we were spending humanitarian assistance, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1752.72s)]
*  12 cents was actually making it to people who needed it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1754.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of waste, man, a lot of crazy stuff. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1757.96s)]
*  So Elon was putting in a lot, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1759.92s)]
*  was Elon doing it for free all that time? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1761.48s)]
*  He was doing it for free. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1764.52s)]
*  Yeah, he was doing it for free. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1765.68s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't need money, right? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1767.1200000000001s)]
*  That's the one thing Elon does not need. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1768.8000000000002s)]
*  So was he, I wonder if he was expecting anything from Trump [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1771.44s)]
*  when they just couldn't figure it out? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1773.72s)]
*  I don't know, I'm just curious about it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1774.78s)]
*  I'm kind of like, you start to see how all this stuff [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1775.98s)]
*  kind of works, you know, and just like, it's like. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1778.1s)]
*  Yeah, like I hear, I really do think he's disappointed [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1779.82s)]
*  about the bill. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1783.12s)]
*  He disagrees with some of the things that were in there. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1783.96s)]
*  He's an emotional guy. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1786.82s)]
*  Look, it happens to everybody. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1788.3999999999999s)]
*  I've flown off the handle way worse [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1789.86s)]
*  than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1792.8s)]
*  But my hope is comes back says, look, made some mistakes. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1795.5s)]
*  Didn't mean to say everything. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1800.8999999999999s)]
*  Let's smooth it out and let's all be friends [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1802.2s)]
*  because again, like I care about the country [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1804.58s)]
*  and I think the country's better off [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1806.3s)]
*  if under the president's leadership, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1808.4199999999998s)]
*  Elon's helping us out as opposed to fighting [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1811.3s)]
*  the administration. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1813.7s)]
*  I don't want him to fight the administration. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1814.54s)]
*  I know the president doesn't want that, but here we are. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1815.74s)]
*  Yeah, he just tweeted a little bit ago [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1818.26s)]
*  that he felt like 80% of the, what was that? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1819.86s)]
*  About a third party or something? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1824.94s)]
*  He tweeted like 300 times. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1827.5s)]
*  Oh, sorry, nevermind. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1829.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1829.94s)]
*  That's all just a regular day for Elon. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1830.78s)]
*  So yeah, he's obviously, I mean, he's definitely, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1834.9s)]
*  he gets a bit rogue. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1837.26s)]
*  Why don't we have- [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1841.1s)]
*  Oh, this is interesting. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1841.94s)]
*  Pull it up, let's see it. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1843.06s)]
*  This post is from an account you muted. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1843.9s)]
*  I'm curious, who did you mute? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1845.7s)]
*  Who is that guy? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1850.7s)]
*  Is that yours? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1851.54s)]
*  It's one of your producers. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1853.14s)]
*  Ian Meelees-Shong. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1855.18s)]
*  Oh, it's a Trump should be impeached [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1857.8600000000001s)]
*  and JD Vance should replace him. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1859.38s)]
*  Dude, that's one vote. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1860.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1863.8200000000002s)]
*  See, this is what I'm talking about. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1864.66s)]
*  This stuff is just- [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1866.14s)]
*  What are you talking about, campaigning? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1866.98s)]
*  This stuff is just not helpful. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1868.8200000000002s)]
*  Again- [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1870.14s)]
*  Yeah, Twitter's definitely- [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1870.98s)]
*  Here's, look, look. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1872.8200000000002s)]
*  My first loyalty is to my family, obviously, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1874.5s)]
*  to the constitution, but politics is a place [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1876.8600000000001s)]
*  where people stab each other in the back [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1881.26s)]
*  and you can't get anything done [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1883.38s)]
*  unless you're all on the same team [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1885.38s)]
*  and you're actually committed to getting stuff done together. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1887.5s)]
*  I just think the idea that the president's, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1889.94s)]
*  the president should be impeached is, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1894.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, it's insane. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1896.26s)]
*  It's totally insane. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1897.5s)]
*  The president is doing a good job [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1899.22s)]
*  and you can, look, you're free to disagree with him. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1901.3400000000001s)]
*  Everybody has a First Amendment right. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1904.22s)]
*  Are you free to disagree with Trump ever? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1905.74s)]
*  Do you feel like you can? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1907.3000000000002s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1908.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean, the way that I put it is, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1910.02s)]
*  if I have a disagreement with the president, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1912.0600000000002s)]
*  then it is my job, obviously, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1913.8600000000001s)]
*  to provide the president honest counsel. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1916.5800000000002s)]
*  He doesn't need me to be a doormat. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1919.02s)]
*  He needs me to actually say what I think about an issue, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1920.42s)]
*  but when the president makes a decision, man, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1922.78s)]
*  he's the general, and when the general makes a decision, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1924.58s)]
*  everybody's gotta go and execute that order, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1927.74s)]
*  and that's kinda how I think about my job, really, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1930.02s)]
*  is to be a good ally and a good friend, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1932.22s)]
*  provide honest counsel to the president, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1934.54s)]
*  but also when a decision's made, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1936.42s)]
*  you go out and get it done. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1938.14s)]
*  Does he listen to many people [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1939.38s)]
*  or does he listen to just one or two? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1940.82s)]
*  He listens to a ton of people. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1942.54s)]
*  It's one of the more interesting things [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1943.66s)]

*  if he's got a big decision to make, he talks to everybody, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1947.42s)]
*  and I think it's why he's in touch with normal people [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1950.7s)]
*  is because he doesn't just talk to congressmen [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1953.9s)]
*  or people with a lot of money. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1956.42s)]

*  what other people are thinking. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=1970.66s)]

*  Because it's always, you always hear every congressman [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2239.1800000000003s)]
*  or senator, not everyone, but sometimes you hear them like, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2241.06s)]
*  I just got it, I don't know what, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2242.7000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't read a thousand pages last night, you know? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  So there are different kinds of bills, okay? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2247.3s)]
*  And I think, so there are things called omnibuses, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2249.82s)]
*  and omnibuses are like a million different things [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2252.58s)]
*  shoved into one bill, and oftentimes, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2256.1800000000003s)]
*  you don't have time to read them. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2259.3s)]
*  The House of Representatives actually adopted a rule [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2260.38s)]
*  to where they have to get, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2263.42s)]
*  I think at least four days to actually read it, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2265.1000000000004s)]
*  to change this, because people weren't getting time [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2266.5400000000004s)]
*  to read this stuff before it got voted on. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2268.7000000000003s)]
*  This particular bill, the way to think about it [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2270.5s)]
*  is basically, if you look at a campaign speech I gave [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2272.7400000000002s)]
*  back in September of 2024, and I said, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2276.6600000000003s)]
*  we're gonna cut taxes on tips, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2279.38s)]
*  we're gonna have no taxes on overtime, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2281.0200000000004s)]
*  we're gonna cut taxes on social security, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2282.5800000000004s)]
*  we're gonna secure the border, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2285.0200000000004s)]
*  we're gonna build more border wall, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2286.26s)]
*  we're gonna hire more border patrol agents, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2287.7000000000003s)]
*  like all that stuff, all of those promises are in this bill. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2289.2200000000003s)]
*  So the way this particular piece of legislation [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2292.82s)]
*  was conceptualized is, rather than take up floor time [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2295.5s)]
*  on a bunch of random different stuff, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2299.38s)]
*  why don't we just do everything, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2301.1800000000003s)]
*  or at least most of the things that we campaigned on, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2302.42s)]
*  that can be done through legislation, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2305.1400000000003s)]
*  and put it into this bill. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2307.02s)]
*  Now that's not saying that there aren't sometimes [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2308.38s)]
*  massive bills that are ridiculous [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2310.2200000000003s)]
*  and don't make a ton of sense, there are, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2312.1800000000003s)]
*  but I think this bill, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2314.02s)]
*  there's a political answer to your question too, okay? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2318.06s)]
*  So let's just say, I'm not gonna name names, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2319.78s)]
*  I don't wanna embarrass anybody, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2323.78s)]
*  but let's say you've got some Republican congressmen [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2324.6200000000003s)]
*  who really love no taxes on tips, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2327.1400000000003s)]
*  but they're a little squishy on the border stuff, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2329.7400000000002s)]
*  they don't agree with what we're doing on the border, okay? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2331.5400000000004s)]
*  Or let's say you got somebody [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2333.42s)]
*  who really loves what we're doing on the border, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2334.9s)]
*  but they don't necessarily like, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2337.02s)]
*  they don't wanna cut taxes for one reason or another. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2338.98s)]
*  If you take enough of this stuff, of our promises again, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2341.38s)]
*  and put it together, you say, look, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2345.6600000000003s)]
*  even if you disagree with parts of it, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2347.42s)]
*  this is what we campaigned on writ large, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2349.3s)]
*  and so we gotta vote on this thing and make it happen. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2352.3s)]
*  Sorry, there's a final answer to this question, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2354.5s)]
*  which is stupid and parliamentary, but it matters, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2356.0600000000004s)]
*  it's actually the most important answer is, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2358.94s)]
*  okay, any bill that you do takes, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2360.98s)]
*  you gotta put it on the floor, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2363.5800000000004s)]
*  and you gotta give people enough time to read it, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2364.86s)]
*  and you gotta amend it, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2366.6200000000003s)]
*  and then you gotta do a committee process, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2367.6200000000003s)]
*  and there's like a constant stream of things, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2369.3s)]
*  there's a big process for it. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2371.5s)]
*  And so if you went through that process [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2373.1000000000004s)]
*  for each individual item, on a separate bill, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2375.94s)]
*  it would take over a year to do all these bills. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2380.18s)]
*  But we gotta prevent taxes from going up, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2382.66s)]
*  we don't have that much time to do it. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2385.18s)]
*  We gotta secure the border, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2386.54s)]
*  we don't have that much time to do it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2387.8199999999997s)]
*  We've gotta do the no tax on social security. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2389.2599999999998s)]
*  Like if we did that 18 months from now, in a smaller bill, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2392.74s)]
*  then we would not be keeping our promises [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2398.14s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2400.06s)]
*  I see. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2400.8999999999996s)]
*  Is there a way that they can just prioritize this? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2401.74s)]
*  I wonder, it just feels like it would make, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2405.3799999999997s)]
*  it would be so much easier to digest as a regular person, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2407.98s)]
*  if you weren't thinking like, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2411.02s)]
*  well heck, my guy's gotta stay up all night for 600 nights [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2412.9s)]
*  to get all this information in, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2416.1s)]
*  and to get it in accurately, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2417.94s)]
*  and then to make fair choices on it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2419.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think the answer to your question [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2420.42s)]
*  is you could do that, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2421.86s)]
*  but Congress would have to change its procedures. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2423.18s)]
*  And could Congress do that if they voted to do it? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2425.2200000000003s)]
*  They could. They could. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2427.26s)]
*  But they would need to change their procedures, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2428.1s)]
*  and the President's attitude is, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2430.9s)]
*  we're not gonna tell you how to run Congress, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2433.46s)]
*  we're working within the constraints that we have, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2436.5s)]
*  and we're just trying to get as much done. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2438.9s)]
*  And look, I mean, people are frustrated with Congress, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2440.46s)]
*  I get it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2442.34s)]
*  People are frustrated with certain things that Congress does, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2443.22s)]
*  I agree with a lot of those criticisms. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2445.46s)]
*  I mean, we do spend way too much money in this country. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2448.54s)]
*  Like it is a reality that we spend too much money, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2450.42s)]
*  but I don't think those criticisms apply [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2453.42s)]
*  to this particular legislation. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2457.02s)]
*  Like one thing I'd ask everybody to say is, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2459.06s)]
*  okay, so big ugly spending bill, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2461.18s)]
*  some people are calling it. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2463.14s)]
*  What is the spending that is done here? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2464.46s)]
*  The biggest single budgetary item, Theo, in this bill [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2466.78s)]
*  is the money to secure the border. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2469.98s)]
*  Like that's not ugly spending, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2471.78s)]
*  that's like the best kind of spending. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2473.42s)]
*  Well, that's a great kind of spending. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2475.02s)]
*  I think, well, no, I agree with that. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2476.14s)]
*  Look, we've had two border officials on [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2479.2200000000003s)]
*  over the past four years, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2481.66s)]
*  and we've learned about all the, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2482.82s)]
*  just the infrastructure issues that they face. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2486.18s)]
*  We've learned about the fact that the executive branch [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2488.66s)]
*  doesn't process any of the, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2491.06s)]
*  like they'll apprehend the guys, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2493.62s)]
*  but then they're not processed. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2494.9s)]
*  I think it's the executive branch. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2496.02s)]
*  Yes, because we don't have the money to do it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2497.14s)]
*  Like that's, okay. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2499.02s)]
*  But they were saying for years guys would come in [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2500.06s)]
*  and they'd have to catch them every other week [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2501.9s)]
*  because they would, and nobody would prosecute them. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2503.34s)]
*  So it was just, then it made them feel [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2505.7799999999997s)]
*  like they didn't have any value. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2507.2999999999997s)]
*  I know that we're signing like 5,000 new people [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2508.22s)]
*  to work at the border. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2510.06s)]
*  So I know that we're giving a lot of new jobs over there. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2510.9s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do, right, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2512.7s)]
*  is create enough resources [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2513.86s)]
*  so that you can actually do all the border enforcement [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2515.7799999999997s)]
*  that we promised. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2517.7799999999997s)]
*  And like the part that the president got immediate action on, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2518.62s)]
*  if you think about this, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2522.7s)]
*  we came in, the president empowered border patrol [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2523.54s)]
*  to stop letting people come across the border illegally. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2526.3799999999997s)]
*  That stopped pretty much immediately. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2529.06s)]
*  You got like a 96% drop in border crossings immediately. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2530.8599999999997s)]
*  The thing is though, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2534.98s)]
*  is you've got 21 million people in here illegally, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2536.3399999999997s)]
*  you gotta send them home. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2539.14s)]
*  You gotta process them. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2540.2599999999998s)]
*  You gotta actually, sometimes some of these people [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2541.18s)]
*  are entitled to some kind of trial [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2543.74s)]
*  for one reason or another. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2546.1s)]
*  So you've gotta like do that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2547.8999999999996s)]
*  That stuff all costs money [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2549.2999999999997s)]
*  and that's where we don't have money to do it right now. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2551.06s)]
*  So that's why this bill's necessary. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2553.54s)]
*  Did, who was that? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2555.54s)]
*  They just said that, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2556.62s)]
*  did Congress have enough time to read this bill? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2559.06s)]
*  Thomas, Rep Thomas Massey said, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2561.2599999999998s)]
*  the house has a 72 hour rule which requires the bill [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2563.74s)]
*  to be posted 72 hours before passage. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2566.7799999999997s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2569.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I'd never heard that before. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2570.06s)]
*  And look, I mean, Thomas Massey and I get along, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2572.58s)]
*  but my understanding is that the bill text [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2575.74s)]
*  was people have had literally weeks to pass it [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2580.42s)]
*  or to read it. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2583.82s)]
*  And the reason, okay, here's the criticism I'd give [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2584.78s)]
*  of what Thomas Massey's saying right here is, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2587.5s)]
*  what's gonna happen is the Senate has to vote on this bill [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2589.86s)]
*  and then it has to go back to the house. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2593.62s)]
*  And it may change like 1%, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2595.58s)]
*  like the Senate may change a sentence [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2598.1800000000003s)]
*  or a paragraph here or there, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2600.1s)]
*  but it's gonna fundamentally be the same bill. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2601.7000000000003s)]
*  So the idea that people haven't had an opportunity [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2603.7400000000002s)]
*  to actually read it is ridiculous. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2605.7400000000002s)]
*  They're in fact gonna have to vote on it again [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2607.46s)]
*  before it even becomes law. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2609.3s)]
*  So they'll have more time. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2611.26s)]
*  They'll have more time. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2612.1000000000004s)]
*  Got it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2612.92s)]
*  Like by necessity, by law, they have to. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2613.76s)]
*  Understood. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2614.6000000000004s)]
*  Part of the bill I know that people are, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2615.98s)]
*  that's getting a lot of attention, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2618.02s)]
*  Is, and I do wanna say like, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2619.58s)]
*  I recognize that like when you get into a place, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2621.54s)]
*  you can't just get what you want, right? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2624.3s)]
*  There's a lot of people in that place [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2626.2200000000003s)]
*  and everybody wants certain things. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2627.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a give and take. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2629.02s)]
*  That's why I say it's good, not perfect. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2629.86s)]
*  There are criticisms to make of it. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2631.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's a give and take, dude. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2632.98s)]
*  You know, you can, yeah, it's like getting in laws [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2634.38s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2637.1400000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2638.1000000000004s)]
*  Any good marriage has give or take. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2639.34s)]
*  Any good relationship has give or take. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2641.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2642.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2643.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2644.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2645.28s)]
*  You gotta compromise a little bit. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2646.1000000000004s)]
*  You gotta accept some things you might not love. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2646.94s)]
*  That's just, that's the nature of the beast. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2648.58s)]
*  Part of the bill that people are talking about [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2651.86s)]
*  is there's like the AI stuff, right? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2653.6200000000003s)]
*  Like the government, like there's a band, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2656.7400000000002s)]
*  is that we're gonna spend a lot of money with AI, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2660.3s)]
*  like in order to advance, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2662.36s)]
*  like bring our government and technologies up to code, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2663.86s)]
*  really. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2666.94s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you're talking about. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2667.78s)]
*  And also it says in there that there's a ban [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2668.6s)]
*  that at state levels, they couldn't prosecute [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2671.4s)]
*  some of these AI companies, right? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2675.18s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2676.96s)]
*  That sounds really sketchy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2677.7999999999997s)]
*  I know what you're talking about, yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2679.56s)]
*  And this is in USAT, I'll just read it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2680.4s)]
*  The ban is tucked into a section of the bill [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2682.7599999999998s)]
*  that would allocate 500 million over the next 10 years [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2684.3199999999997s)]
*  to modernize government systems with the help of AI [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2687.24s)]
*  and automation technologies. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2690.08s)]
*  The ban would not only prevent new state led regulations [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2691.72s)]
*  of AI, but would also block dozens of states [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2694.5s)]
*  from enforcing pre-existing AI regulations [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2696.84s)]
*  and oversight structures. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2699.2400000000002s)]
*  It feels scary. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2701.32s)]
*  Yeah, so let me say a couple things about this. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2703.0s)]
*  So I actually was talking to a couple of senators [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  on the way down here about this [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2709.44s)]
*  because they really hate this provision. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2711.32s)]
*  And actually both, we brought them on [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2713.96s)]
*  because it's Bill Haggerty and Marsha Blackburn, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2716.52s)]
*  great people, they represent the state of Tennessee. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2719.36s)]
*  So they don't like this provision. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2721.44s)]
*  And they brought up a really interesting point [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2723.8s)]
*  so Tennessee obviously has a lot of musicians, right? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2726.12s)]
*  And Tennessee wants to protect those musicians [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2728.66s)]
*  from having basically AI steal [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2731.72s)]
*  the production of their artists, right? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2735.2s)]
*  Because one of the big problems with AI, right? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2737.12s)]
*  Is you're gonna be able to take somebody's voice [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2738.8399999999997s)]
*  and then like Taylor Swift's voice or anybody else's voice [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2741.3199999999997s)]
*  and basically say, oh, okay, well based on this one song [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2747.6s)]
*  that Robert Plant did 35 years ago, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2752.38s)]
*  we're gonna like make a whole new Led Zeppelin song [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2756.34s)]
*  using artificial intelligence, right? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2758.54s)]
*  And they wanna protect people [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2760.98s)]
*  from that kind of thing happening. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2762.3s)]
*  So that's a totally reasonable point to me. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2764.1s)]
*  The reason that provision is in there [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2766.06s)]
*  is because you think about how like woke [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2768.3s)]
*  the Google searches got. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2772.2200000000003s)]
*  Remember when you like search, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2773.58s)]
*  what does George Washington look like [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2774.6600000000003s)]
*  and it show you like a picture of a black dude. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2776.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, or like a little Japanese George Washington [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2777.7400000000002s)]
*  or something. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2781.78s)]
*  So the idea is you use, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2782.6200000000003s)]
*  you basically have a federal regulation that prevents, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2784.98s)]
*  a federal regulation that prevents like California [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2790.7400000000002s)]
*  from having a super progressive set of regulations [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2795.94s)]
*  on artificial intelligence, right? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2799.0600000000004s)]
*  That's the argument for it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2800.5400000000004s)]
*  The argument against it is that if the feds [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2801.9s)]
*  aren't protecting artists, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2804.78s)]
*  then you're not gonna be able to protect artists either. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2806.86s)]
*  And so, honestly, I don't think the provision, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2810.46s)]
*  to be honest with you, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2813.34s)]
*  I don't think that's gonna make it in the final bill, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2814.18s)]
*  but I usually have a pretty strong view on most things. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2815.98s)]
*  I can kind of go both ways on this [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2818.78s)]
*  because I don't want California's progressive regulations [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2820.1s)]
*  to control artificial intelligence. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2822.7400000000002s)]
*  I also agree with Marsha and Bill [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2824.7s)]
*  that you wanna protect country artists in Nashville [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2827.02s)]
*  from having their crap stolen by AI. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2830.78s)]
*  Like I get that. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2832.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's interesting. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2833.34s)]
*  I mean, that kind of stuff, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2834.94s)]
*  it's like, cause they made a bunch of little babies [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2835.78s)]
*  of all the like a lot of podcasters [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2837.82s)]
*  and now they're doing it with everybody. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2839.54s)]
*  Like they got dang, you know, Aaron Rodgers baby. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2841.06s)]
*  They got left eye from that Milli Vanilli woman or whatever. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2844.66s)]
*  They have everybody in there. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2848.54s)]
*  And so, but a lot of- [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2850.1s)]
*  Milli Vanilli man, too soon. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2852.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2853.58s)]
*  I'm still, I'm a Milli Vanilli truther by the way. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2854.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2856.62s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2857.46s)]
*  I think it was really them. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2858.3s)]
*  I just think they were taken advantage of, but. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2859.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2860.98s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2863.1s)]
*  You know, there's like seven of us left, don't you? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2863.98s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2868.06s)]
*  That was a catchy song. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2869.06s)]
*  So I was born in 1984. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2870.38s)]
*  That's one of the first songs I remember [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2871.42s)]
*  like playing in a radio. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2873.14s)]
*  Play me, oh. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2874.38s)]
*  Dude, remember that song? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2875.5s)]
*  I'm the one who wants to. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2876.5s)]
*  I do remember that song. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2879.1800000000003s)]
*  Be with you. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2880.02s)]
*  That was like mid nineties, right? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2881.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2883.2200000000003s)]
*  It was good though. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2884.06s)]
*  Trying to think of- [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2885.34s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the band. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2886.1800000000003s)]
*  I think it was kind of a one hit wonder. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2887.02s)]
*  Mr. Big. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2888.2200000000003s)]
*  That was Mr. Big, okay. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2889.06s)]
*  That's kind of one hit wonder, right? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2890.06s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah, it were. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2891.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's too bad. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2892.2200000000003s)]
*  God, they were good, dude. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2893.2200000000003s)]
*  That was a good song. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2894.06s)]
*  Remember the first song you ever heard? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2894.9s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the first song I ever heard [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2897.66s)]
*  was Layla by Eric Clapton, the original one, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2898.8999999999996s)]
*  not the acoustic one. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2902.74s)]
*  Dude, my buddy, I used to live with my buddy's dad, right? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2904.06s)]
*  Cause he was getting, I had like rectal dysfunction [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2906.3399999999997s)]
*  so I was pretty young. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2909.14s)]
*  And then I was living with him [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2909.98s)]
*  cause he was getting like a early script on- [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2912.06s)]
*  What? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2914.8999999999996s)]
*  On pill, ED pills or whatever, you know, wiener pills. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2916.74s)]
*  And so I stayed over there [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2919.8999999999996s)]
*  and I cop a little bit off of his. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2921.14s)]
*  But anyway, he used to hook up with this lady [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2923.86s)]
*  and I was learning the guitar. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2926.86s)]
*  He made me go play- [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2928.1800000000003s)]
*  Layla? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2929.78s)]
*  No, Tears in Heaven. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2930.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh man, that's a sad, you know, that's about his son, Diane. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2931.46s)]
*  And it was the only song I knew and they like play it again. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2935.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2938.1s)]
*  I see, this is one of those things [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2938.94s)]
*  where I hope to God you're joking. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2941.9s)]
*  Cause if you're living in Seed's house, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2943.58s)]
*  how old were you at the time? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2945.42s)]
*  Oh, probably 27. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2946.9s)]
*  Okay, so you're 27 stealing ED pills, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2948.3s)]
*  playing Tears in Heaven. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2951.26s)]
*  That's a bad situation. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2952.46s)]
*  You gotta get out of that situation, man. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2954.5s)]
*  I'm gonna assume that you're joking [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2955.62s)]
*  because I don't wanna have nightmares about this later on. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2957.02s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2960.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2961.1s)]
*  That's the healthcare system we have. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2961.94s)]
*  We have the healthcare system. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2962.7799999999997s)]
*  All right, so on the way over- [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2964.06s)]
*  No, I'm just joking, that is a true story though. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2965.14s)]
*  I hear you, on the way down here, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2966.62s)]
*  on the way down here, there's like an advertisement [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2969.94s)]
*  for some like MedPak. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2972.7799999999997s)]
*  It was on, it was a TV commercial. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2974.58s)]
*  And I don't really watch like normal TV. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2977.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't see commercials that often anymore. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2978.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's like MedPak and it's like order this thing [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2980.94s)]
*  and it costs $45 and it has these different drugs in it. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2983.82s)]
*  And I only saw it briefly, but I could have sworn [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2985.98s)]
*  that two of the medications in this MedPak were, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2989.5800000000004s)]
*  and it's advertised as like an emergency medicine, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2993.0200000000004s)]
*  are ivermectin and ozempic. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2996.38s)]
*  And I'm like thinking to myself, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=2999.26s)]
*  what is the situation where you need emergency ozempic? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3000.98s)]
*  So like the second half of the flight down here, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3005.42s)]
*  I'm thinking to myself, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3008.26s)]
*  what is the emergency ozempic situation? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3009.0800000000004s)]
*  And then I thought like, you know, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3011.0600000000004s)]
*  if you have a Dahmer party situation [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3012.94s)]
*  and it's like, all right, you know, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3014.7s)]
*  we got to suppress our appetites here. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3016.3399999999997s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3021.1s)]
*  But maybe it was just ivermectin, maybe it was an ozempic. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3022.54s)]
*  But see, stuff like that is kind of crazy to me. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3025.9s)]
*  Well, now they're combining it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3028.62s)]
*  It's just, everything is combined now. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3029.98s)]
*  You know, they even put, I think it's Pizza Hut [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3031.9s)]
*  and Baskin-Robbins are together now. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3033.9s)]
*  It's like everything I think is mixed now. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3035.62s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3037.54s)]
*  That kind of makes sense though. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3038.38s)]
*  It kind of does. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3039.74s)]
*  It's a pizza and then some ice cream. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3040.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3042.2599999999998s)]
*  That's true, you're right. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3043.1s)]
*  So what I never understood was like, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3043.98s)]
*  what was it? Ivermectin. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3045.62s)]
*  Taco Bell and KFC. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3046.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3048.2999999999997s)]
*  What is that? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3050.06s)]
*  It's one or the other. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3050.9s)]
*  That's called indigestion, right? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3051.72s)]
*  That is the only way that combination mixes. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3053.66s)]
*  It should be one or the other. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3056.58s)]
*  It should be one or the other. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3057.9s)]
*  You do not need, if you're going to Taco Bell and KFC [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3058.74s)]
*  in the same stop, you got serious problems. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3061.58s)]
*  Did you, let me think about something that's important, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3064.22s)]
*  JD, or people are not even gonna believe [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3067.2599999999998s)]
*  that we spent time together. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3068.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3069.46s)]
*  This is fun though, man. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3071.1400000000003s)]
*  This is good. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3071.98s)]
*  It's good. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3072.8s)]
*  It is good, man. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3073.6400000000003s)]
*  Dude, I just can't even believe that that's your life. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3074.48s)]
*  Is it what you thought it would be? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3076.94s)]
*  Is it different once you got in there? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3078.1000000000004s)]
*  Are things that different? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3079.46s)]
*  It's about what I thought it would be. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3081.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, at this point, right, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3082.5800000000004s)]
*  I know the president pretty well. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3083.78s)]
*  And I knew that he would, I knew he had a lot of trust in me. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3085.98s)]
*  And again, the role of the vice president [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3090.5800000000004s)]
*  is very derivative of what the president is doing. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3092.3s)]
*  So if the president has trust in you, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3094.34s)]
*  if he gives you a task and just lets you go and do it, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3096.44s)]
*  that's kind of what your job is. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3098.94s)]
*  And it's been a lot of fun. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3101.86s)]
*  Like I've traveled all over the world. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3103.5s)]
*  I think we've done a lot of good work [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3105.1600000000003s)]
*  for the American people, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3106.46s)]
*  which of course is the most important part. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3107.3s)]
*  There are little things that I, you know, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3110.6600000000003s)]
*  we'll take some time getting used to. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3112.06s)]
*  So like we got three little kids. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3114.2400000000002s)]
*  Our son just turned eight yesterday actually. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3115.58s)]
*  And then we have a five-year-old son, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3118.1800000000003s)]
*  the three-year-old baby girl. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3119.7000000000003s)]
*  And our eight-year-old son is, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3121.1800000000003s)]
*  he's a little bit of an introvert, I think. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3124.06s)]
*  And so he doesn't love the attention. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3126.38s)]
*  But then our like five-year-old son [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3128.18s)]
*  is a little bit more like me. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3130.02s)]
*  So he'll like roll off the airplane, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3131.42s)]
*  wave in, say hello to everybody. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3133.1s)]
*  And having Secret Service around is kind of a crazy [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3134.66s)]
*  experience. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3138.66s)]
*  Like they're all good dudes and I love them, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3139.5s)]
*  but it's also kind of unusual to like just walk [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3141.02s)]
*  outside your house and there's always somebody, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3143.46s)]
*  you know, walking with you. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3145.14s)]
*  That's kind of weird. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3146.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3147.38s)]
*  I think- [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3148.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we went back to go chat for, you know, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3149.08s)]
*  like five minutes just before this thing started. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3150.94s)]
*  And, you know, I was like, don't worry guys, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3152.74s)]
*  Theo doesn't have a gun. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3154.8199999999997s)]
*  He's like, I hope you don't. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3156.14s)]
*  No, they checked me. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3157.38s)]
*  So we're in deep shit, man. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3158.2200000000003s)]
*  They checked me. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3159.46s)]
*  Somebody kissed me on the way. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3160.3s)]
*  And I was like, that's part of it. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3161.7400000000002s)]
*  One of the Secret Service agents? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3163.06s)]
*  No, I'm joking. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3163.9s)]
*  I was like, what's your secret buddy, huh? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3164.94s)]
*  You know? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3166.82s)]
*  Oh, that's Milly Vanilli right there as babies, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3168.3s)]
*  right there using that. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3169.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3170.7400000000002s)]
*  Wait, they had, those are Grammys, right? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3173.34s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3175.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, they took their Grammys away. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3177.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, didn't one of them- [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3178.94s)]
*  They took their Grammys away? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3179.78s)]
*  Didn't one of them commit suicide? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3181.42s)]
*  It's a kind of a sad story, actually. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3183.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3185.2200000000003s)]
*  And one of them died a couple of years ago. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3186.06s)]
*  I met one of them one night, I think. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3186.98s)]
*  Maybe I didn't. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3188.7s)]
*  I was out late one night, I'll say that. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3189.58s)]
*  Sorry, that's a crazy, what are we talking about? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3192.7s)]
*  Let's talk about- [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3195.66s)]
*  Could have been Milly Vanilli, could have been my uncle. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3196.5s)]
*  Who knows, who am I to say? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3198.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3202.26s)]
*  I'll just say I met one of Freddy's buddies, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3203.3s)]
*  one of Frederick's buddies out there. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3205.9s)]
*  I'll say this, man, right now, sir, I will say it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3208.06s)]
*  So people have to, like, we all need help [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3211.62s)]
*  when whenever we're, like, when you're politicianing, right? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3214.14s)]
*  Like, you need help, you need support. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3217.6600000000003s)]
*  You have sponsors and stuff, right? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3218.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3220.1400000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of speculation and talk, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3220.98s)]
*  like, one of your primary sponsors is a guy, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3221.94s)]
*  Peter Thiel, right? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3224.9s)]
*  And he's in the tech world. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3226.34s)]
*  And I never met him, you know? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3228.38s)]
*  Sure. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3229.6200000000003s)]
*  But, you know, there's a lot of these tech kind of lords, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3230.6600000000003s)]
*  like, they, you know, technology's grown so much [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3233.7000000000003s)]
*  in the past 20 years that it controls a lot [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3236.94s)]
*  of our environment and our life, right? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3240.3s)]
*  It does. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3241.94s)]
*  What do you owe somebody if you do, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3243.1400000000003s)]
*  like, if you get into office, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3245.38s)]
*  if somebody, like, donates a lot of money to your campaign, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3247.26s)]
*  like, how does that relationship work after that? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3249.9s)]
*  I think the attitude is you don't owe them anything. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3252.26s)]
*  And I think if you take the attitude [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3254.58s)]
*  of you owe somebody something, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3256.3s)]
*  then you're fundamentally not gonna do the job [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3257.62s)]
*  that you were meant to do. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3259.3s)]
*  I mean, this is always, this is tough, right? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3261.2200000000003s)]
*  Because, so take my Senate race, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3263.7000000000003s)]
*  first time I ever ran for office was 2022. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3266.54s)]
*  I ran for the Ohio Senate race. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3269.94s)]
*  I won. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3272.38s)]
*  You did? That race, yeah. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3273.2200000000003s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3274.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3276.2200000000003s)]
*  That's good, yeah. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3277.0600000000004s)]
*  If I hadn't won, I wouldn't be sitting here. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3277.9s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3280.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3280.86s)]
*  Yeah, no idea. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3281.7000000000003s)]
*  Because then I became the vice president of nominee [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3282.54s)]
*  and now I'm here. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3283.38s)]
*  So I basically won, I've run two campaigns in my life. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3284.2200000000003s)]
*  The first one, the Senate campaign cost $45 million. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3287.0600000000004s)]
*  The second one, presidential campaign, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3289.6600000000003s)]
*  I think that we spent like $1.2 billion, okay? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3291.6600000000003s)]
*  So it costs a lot of money. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3295.42s)]
*  Well, the president obviously is the leader of the campaign. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3297.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, on him, on the total campaign. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3299.3s)]
*  The total campaign. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3300.1400000000003s)]
*  Got it. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3300.98s)]
*  So it costs a lot of money to run for office [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3301.82s)]
*  and you gotta go and raise money. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3305.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3306.38s)]
*  But I think that if your attitude is, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3307.34s)]
*  I owe something to these people who gave me money, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3309.06s)]
*  then you're gonna end up being corrupted. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3311.06s)]
*  And you've gotta kind of take the attitude of, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3313.58s)]
*  they're supporting me because they agree with me. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3316.22s)]
*  And obviously like you have conversations with them, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3319.42s)]
*  like you mentioned Peter Thiel. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3321.06s)]
*  I see a lot of crazy stuff on the internet about Peter Thiel. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3322.5s)]
*  Like, you know, he's always been a friend of mine. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3325.66s)]
*  He's always been one of the smartest people I've ever met. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3328.14s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3330.26s)]
*  Just a very thoughtful dude. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3331.1s)]
*  But he's literally never asked me once for anything. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3332.46s)]
*  So he just believed in you? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3335.94s)]
*  He believed in me. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3337.7s)]
*  He agreed with me on a lot of issues. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3339.02s)]
*  I mean, he definitely has like said, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3340.82s)]
*  hey, I don't agree with you on this, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3342.1s)]
*  but he's never said, I don't agree with you on this. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3343.14s)]
*  Therefore you should vote differently or act differently. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3345.1s)]
*  But it's like, to be honest with you, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3347.94s)]
*  it's one of the risks of our system. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3349.86s)]
*  Now, if you think about it, right? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3351.98s)]
*  Cause if you are a super ambitious dude or girl [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3353.58s)]
*  and you really wanna run for office, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3358.14s)]
*  you gotta be able to separate yourself [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3360.98s)]
*  from that donor pressure. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3362.98s)]
*  And think about it, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3364.58s)]
*  like if you're going to do a fundraiser, okay? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3365.42s)]
*  Everybody's gonna go to fundraisers and politics. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3367.62s)]
*  Well, that's like an hour and a half you're not spending [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3369.86s)]
*  talking to the people you represent, right? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3371.7s)]
*  So there is one of the problems in our system [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3374.38s)]
*  is the people spend so much time raising money. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3377.1s)]
*  I think sometimes, not all cases, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3380.1s)]
*  but sometimes it can have a corrupting influence [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3382.3s)]
*  on the process. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3384.7s)]
*  Now, I was talking to a buddy of mine actually about this, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3385.86s)]
*  because his argument is, yeah, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3387.94s)]
*  he's like a political consultant, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3389.98s)]
*  he's a political hack, but a good dude. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3391.26s)]
*  He said, our system is better though, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3392.9s)]
*  cause in some places they have publicly financed campaigns. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3396.86s)]
*  And he's like, the problem with places [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3400.1s)]
*  where they have publicly financed campaigns [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3401.54s)]
*  is that all of the control in the political system [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3404.1400000000003s)]
*  is with the media. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3408.1s)]
*  Because if you raise money, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3409.34s)]
*  most of what you're spending your money on [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3411.78s)]
*  is TV radio advertisements, it's reaching voters. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3412.98s)]
*  So if you can't reach voters with TV advertisements [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3416.06s)]
*  and you gotta go on the corporate media [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3418.7s)]
*  to get your message out there, that's even worse. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3420.94s)]
*  So I kind of see both sides of it. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3423.18s)]
*  I just think as a practical matter, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3424.7799999999997s)]
*  what I try to do is remember that, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3427.06s)]
*  it's an honor to serve, but it's also a sacrifice to serve. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3430.66s)]
*  And if people are gonna write me a check, great, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3433.66s)]
*  but I don't owe them anything. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3435.58s)]
*  That's the attitude I try to have. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3437.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's interesting because, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3438.98s)]
*  I mean, we all have people that help us do certain things [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3441.18s)]
*  or are supportive, and then you get in spots where you're like, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3443.14s)]
*  I used to live with a family when I was growing up [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3446.62s)]
*  and there's always been this thing like, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3448.54s)]
*  what do I owe them? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3449.38s)]
*  Not that they've ever said I owed them anything, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3450.74s)]
*  but it's like, there's always this feeling inside of you. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3452.58s)]
*  And so I'm sure a lot of people [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3456.02s)]
*  can relate to things like that. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3457.02s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by Massa Chips. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3459.74s)]
*  It's time to get those processed seed oils out of our lives. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3463.66s)]
*  And Massa Chips is at the forefront. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3467.94s)]
*  Did you know all chips and fries used to be cooked in tallow [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3471.06s)]
*  up until the 1990s when big corporations [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3475.22s)]
*  switched to cheap processed seed oils? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3478.1s)]
*  Massa decided to do something about it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3481.2599999999998s)]
*  They created a tasty and delicis delicios tortilla chip [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3483.8199999999997s)]
*  with just three ingredients and no seed oils. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3488.8599999999997s)]
*  These chips don't only avoid all the bad stuff, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3492.46s)]
*  they taste great too. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3495.18s)]
*  I've got about four or five flavors here at the house [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3496.8599999999997s)]
*  and I think Cabanero is one of them [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3499.3399999999997s)]
*  and I'm digging them baby. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3502.2599999999998s)]
*  And they don't break. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3503.18s)]
*  That's what I like, these chips are sturdy baby. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3504.06s)]
*  They don't crack off in your guac [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3506.02s)]
*  and get the job half done baby. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3508.22s)]
*  These things are, they're not just a worker, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3510.2599999999998s)]

*  Like to a regular guy on the street, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3680.24s)]

*  I hear you. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3694.2s)]

*  It definitely makes sense to me. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3695.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, let me try to explain. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3697.24s)]
*  So to be clear, I'm not an expert on this particular deal. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3699.2799999999997s)]
*  I actually just read about it earlier today, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3702.04s)]
*  or maybe yesterday, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3704.72s)]
*  but the president did an executive order, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3705.68s)]
*  I don't know, a couple of months ago. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3708.3599999999997s)]
*  And the basic idea is you've got [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3709.8399999999997s)]
*  all this different information, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3711.72s)]
*  but it's not accessible in one place. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3714.04s)]
*  So like, let me give you an example [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3717.3599999999997s)]
*  where this might be useful. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3718.72s)]
*  Let's say you catch an illegal immigrant, okay? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3720.04s)]
*  And that person's using a social security number, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3723.04s)]
*  but the Department of Homeland Security [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3725.8399999999997s)]
*  that arrests the person can't actually figure out [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3727.6s)]
*  what social security number that illegal immigrant is, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3730.12s)]
*  what name it's attached to, okay? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3733.12s)]
*  Or let's say you're like investigating some terrorist [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3735.44s)]
*  and the FBI arrests the person, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3739.56s)]
*  but there are information about like [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3741.7599999999998s)]
*  where the person lived a couple of years ago [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3743.96s)]
*  that you'd like to have. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3745.92s)]
*  So you'd maybe like to go talk to their friends [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3746.7599999999998s)]
*  or associates or whatever. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3749.2799999999997s)]
*  My understanding is that it does sound odd, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3750.88s)]
*  but that what they're trying to do [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3754.96s)]
*  is take all the information [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3756.48s)]
*  that the Department of Homeland Security has, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3757.92s)]
*  that the FBI has, and just make it [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3759.6s)]
*  so that it's actually not in some hyper inefficient system, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3761.76s)]
*  it's all sort of accessible. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3765.44s)]
*  And here's the thing, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3767.6400000000003s)]
*  modern technology is just crazy and weird [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3769.7200000000003s)]
*  and it affects our privacy. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3772.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think we don't have to think that's a good thing. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3774.2400000000002s)]
*  It is like a reality of the world that we live in. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3777.5200000000004s)]
*  Right, it sounds like you get a little romantic about things. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3780.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, look. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3782.4s)]
*  And I think it's gonna go back in time. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3783.44s)]
*  I mean, everybody, I kind of agree with you. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3784.88s)]
*  I think people are sort of gonna rebel [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3787.0800000000004s)]
*  against technology a little bit. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3788.84s)]
*  In some ways they already are, but we look, dude, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3790.56s)]
*  if I, this has happened to me so many times [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3793.12s)]
*  where I'm talking to my wife, like, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3796.84s)]
*  oh, what are we gonna make for dinner for the kids tonight? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3797.92s)]
*  Oh, let's just like do DoorDash or Grubhub. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3799.72s)]
*  And then you go on like X or you go on, you know, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3802.24s)]
*  Facebook or Instagram, and there's like an advertisement [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3805.44s)]
*  for a DoorDash coupon. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3807.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's like, well, I was just talking about this [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3809.32s)]
*  10 minutes ago. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3810.72s)]
*  So we know that big technology spies on us [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3811.72s)]
*  and harvests our data. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3815.32s)]
*  I honestly worry more about that [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3816.84s)]
*  than about like connecting the DHS system [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3819.12s)]
*  to the FBI system. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3822.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's all that this Palantir deal is part, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3823.44s)]
*  like a lot of that, it's just connecting information. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3825.48s)]
*  So I'm hardly an expert, but that is my understanding [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3829.2s)]
*  is that it's just taking, okay, DHS has information, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3831.6s)]
*  FBI has information, Secretary of the Treasury [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3834.0s)]
*  has information, and making it possible for [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3836.16s)]
*  that information to be searched [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3839.48s)]
*  by whoever is looking for it. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3841.64s)]
*  That's my understanding. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3844.24s)]
*  But again, like I hear that same, that story, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3846.32s)]
*  and my reaction is the same, which is, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3848.96s)]
*  oh, I don't like the government having my information. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3851.08s)]
*  The reality is the government already has my information. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3853.96s)]
*  And more importantly, some of these private technology [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3856.04s)]
*  companies have way more information on me [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3858.44s)]
*  than the government does. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3861.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3862.4s)]
*  I mean, anywhere you shop has unbelievable information [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3863.24s)]
*  on you. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3865.8s)]
*  I mean, let me tell you like crazy- [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3866.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude, Blockbuster two days ago, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3867.48s)]
*  Blockbuster was like, happy birthday, they were wrong. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3868.68s)]
*  I gotta- [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3871.88s)]
*  It's like, you're out of business. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3873.48s)]
*  There's a- [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3877.0s)]
*  Yeah, when was the last time you were at a Blockbuster? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3877.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3879.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3880.7999999999997s)]
*  But some guy somewhere, probably in another country, Nepal, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3881.7999999999997s)]
*  is sitting somewhere- [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3886.12s)]
*  You and FDR took your Celsius and went down to Blockbuster [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3886.9599999999996s)]
*  to get some VHS rentals. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3890.24s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit of boogie. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3893.12s)]
*  Little boogie nights for the fellas. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3895.9199999999996s)]
*  That was FDR's favorite movies. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3900.3999999999996s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3902.8s)]
*  So, all right. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3904.0400000000004s)]
*  What were we talking about? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3905.48s)]
*  Technology. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3906.32s)]
*  Okay, so I was, okay, I was getting a brief. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3907.1600000000003s)]
*  So- [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3911.6400000000003s)]
*  Cause that's what people- [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3912.48s)]
*  When I first became, no, no, they are, and I get it. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3913.32s)]
*  And look, like all I'll tell you is we try to be as- [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3914.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, I did go to the last Blockbuster. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3917.88s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3919.2000000000003s)]
*  How old was that? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3920.36s)]
*  How old was that? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3921.2000000000003s)]
*  Is that 14 years ago? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3922.0400000000004s)]
*  That? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3922.88s)]
*  No, that's fricking two years ago, dude. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3923.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't realize Blockbuster was still a thing two years ago. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3925.0800000000004s)]
*  I actually lived out there. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3926.92s)]
*  I got stuck in the snow out there. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3927.76s)]
*  Yeah, so, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3928.6000000000004s)]
*  so I got a brief from my national security guy. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3930.44s)]
*  I gotta make sure I can, it's not classified information. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3934.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, no, it's not classified information. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3936.76s)]
*  Okay, basically, long story short, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3938.04s)]
*  one of the guys who works in the national security team [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3940.52s)]
*  of the Trump administration gave me this brief about how, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3942.68s)]
*  okay, when you're using an iPad, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3947.2400000000002s)]
*  and let's say, you're reading a story [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3949.6s)]
*  from some random newspaper, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3954.7200000000003s)]
*  and you hover on a particular paragraph, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3957.24s)]
*  like your iPad is collecting that information on you. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3960.56s)]
*  God. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3963.3599999999997s)]
*  Like it's actually trying to track what you're doing. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3964.2s)]
*  Like that is the stuff that really freaks me out. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3966.96s)]
*  Well, how do we stop that? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3969.16s)]
*  I think it freaks everybody out. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3970.24s)]
*  I think it just makes people sick. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3971.24s)]
*  It's like, you don't even feel like you exist [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3972.4s)]
*  for any purpose anymore, other than to be advertised to, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3974.72s)]
*  or to be, I don't even know anything else sometimes. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3978.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, you think about it, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3981.12s)]
*  like our, think about 100 years ago, 50 years ago, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3982.12s)]
*  the most brilliant scientists in the world, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3986.44s)]
*  they're trying to figure out nuclear energy, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3988.2400000000002s)]
*  they're trying to figure out how to cure cancer. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3990.4s)]
*  Now, way too many of them are figuring out, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3993.08s)]
*  like, how do I get a person to linger [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3995.52s)]
*  on a digital advertisement for a little bit longer [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=3997.56s)]
*  so that we can increase the price of the ad [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4000.04s)]
*  that we sell them by three pennies? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4001.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4003.48s)]
*  There's something I think very, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4004.56s)]
*  that warps our entire economy [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4006.04s)]
*  about the digital advertisement world, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4008.0s)]
*  because too many smart people are focused [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4010.56s)]
*  on getting us addicted to these applications. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4013.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4015.44s)]
*  I mean, what do we do about it? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4017.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, one thing is, from a policy perspective, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4017.96s)]
*  we've already looked into a lot of things [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4021.2000000000003s)]
*  we can do on data privacy and protection. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4023.36s)]
*  So we're trying to make it harder for these firms [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4025.52s)]
*  to collect information on you. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4027.88s)]
*  Well, it feels like with this, with Palantir, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4029.84s)]
*  it's like they're gonna collect all the information, though. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4031.48s)]
*  So that feels like- [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4033.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, my understanding again, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4034.96s)]
*  so this is full disclosure, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4037.5600000000004s)]
*  because I think it's important- [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4039.48s)]
*  Is there somebody else that would know more about it? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4040.32s)]
*  I think it's important to be open. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4041.1600000000003s)]
*  So Palantir, you asked about Peter Thiel. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4042.92s)]
*  Palantir is actually one of the companies [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4044.72s)]
*  that he invested in, right? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4047.2s)]
*  So, you know- [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4048.52s)]
*  Oh, he doesn't run it. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4049.3599999999997s)]
*  I would be full, my understanding is he doesn't run it. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4050.2s)]
*  But I don't believe that Palantir [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4051.9199999999996s)]
*  is collecting any information. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4055.08s)]
*  I believe it's purely building a database [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4056.6s)]
*  that's sort of combining the information. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4058.9199999999996s)]
*  Is that, I might have seen my team that you guys get, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4061.08s)]
*  is that right? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4062.68s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4063.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4064.3399999999997s)]
*  Cool. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4065.18s)]
*  No, I'm glad, yeah. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4066.0s)]
*  Because yeah, we're just trying to figure it out. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4066.8399999999997s)]
*  And I think, I mean, right now, I think Palantir has like, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4068.04s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of conflict right now in Gaza. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4070.9199999999996s)]
*  Everybody knows about that. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4074.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4075.2799999999997s)]
*  And Palantir has been accused of being complicit [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4076.12s)]
*  in a lot of the violence over there. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4079.56s)]
*  And so I think that's where it gets really scary [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4082.16s)]
*  for like regular person on the street. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4084.48s)]
*  I'm like, well, if this is the company, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4086.3599999999997s)]
*  because you see videos of like horrific stuff online. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4089.56s)]
*  Sure, very sad stuff. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4091.8799999999997s)]
*  And you're like, well, if this is the company we're hiring, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4093.24s)]
*  how do I know that I might not be walking down the street [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4096.62s)]
*  and just a sniper bullet could hit me from them? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4099.48s)]
*  So that is- [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4102.84s)]
*  To be really honest with you. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4104.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, I hear what you're saying. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4105.400000000001s)]
*  And I think the answer to that question is [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4106.64s)]
*  the only real protection that we have against that [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4109.12s)]
*  is that we've got to, you know, elect the right people. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4113.4400000000005s)]
*  And we've got to make sure [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4117.24s)]
*  that our government doesn't do crazy stuff. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4118.860000000001s)]
*  Because I mean, look, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4121.84s)]
*  any of these information can be misused. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4122.66s)]
*  Like our government has your social security number, okay? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4124.64s)]
*  Using that information, the government could spy on you. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4127.96s)]
*  The government could give your information [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4132.6s)]
*  over to an illegal alien to start a fake account [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4134.8s)]
*  in your name. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4136.72s)]
*  And that, by the way, happens. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4137.56s)]
*  I had a friend of mine who had an illegal alien [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4138.38s)]
*  steal his social security number. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4140.6s)]
*  And when he went to the IRS to complain about it, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4142.280000000001s)]
*  they wouldn't give him information [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4144.360000000001s)]
*  on the person who was stealing his stuff. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4146.240000000001s)]
*  And by the way, that's what we're trying to do [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4149.68s)]
*  is make it so the IRS can talk [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4151.320000000001s)]
*  to the Department of Homeland Security. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4153.0s)]
*  But the only real protection against this stuff, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4155.64s)]
*  I think, is to have a government [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4157.8s)]
*  that actually protects the rights of its citizens. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4159.84s)]
*  And, you know, if, I mean, we should all be worried [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4163.24s)]
*  about our privacy being invaded by the government. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4166.56s)]
*  I think we should be just as worried [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4169.32s)]
*  about private corporations as we should be the government. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4170.84s)]
*  I think, you know, everybody can invade our privacy. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4172.8s)]
*  But I don't, let me put this away. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4175.5s)]
*  I don't think that the solution to that problem [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4178.12s)]
*  is to like pretend that the government [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4181.24s)]
*  doesn't already have this information. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4185.0s)]
*  It just does. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4186.12s)]
*  You got to make sure it doesn't misuse it. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4187.16s)]
*  And that's my view, at least, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4188.88s)]
*  is we got to live in reality [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4190.56s)]
*  and the government's already got this information. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4191.56s)]
*  We just need to make sure they don't misuse it. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4193.04s)]
*  And on like the Gaza thing, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4196.68s)]
*  just sort of, you know, chat about that for a little bit. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4198.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm like a human being. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4201.12s)]
*  So I look at this stuff, I see these videos, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4204.46s)]
*  I see the pictures, and it's very heartbreaking. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4207.12s)]
*  And, you know, just since you brought it up, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4209.96s)]
*  like what we're trying to do here [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4211.68s)]
*  is try to solve two problems here, okay? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4213.36s)]
*  So on the one hand, you've got innocent people, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4216.72s)]
*  innocent Palestinians, and innocent Israeli hostages, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4221.76s)]
*  by the way, who are like caught up [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4224.52s)]
*  in this terrible violence that's happening as we speak, okay? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4227.34s)]
*  And we're trying to get as much aid [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4231.64s)]
*  and as much support into people as humanly possible. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4233.04s)]
*  That's like one thing that's going on. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4235.320000000001s)]
*  The other side is Israel's attacked [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4236.9400000000005s)]
*  by this terrible terrorist organization. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4239.08s)]
*  I think people sometimes forget that, right? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4240.72s)]
*  They forget like the thing that kicked this off [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4242.26s)]
*  is that we had this terrible terrorist attack [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4244.4400000000005s)]
*  and you had a lot of innocent Israeli civilians die [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4247.68s)]
*  in that terrorist attack. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4249.0s)]
*  And so I think what we're trying to do [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4250.400000000001s)]
*  in the Trump administration with that situation [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4252.72s)]
*  is to get to a peaceful resolution. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4255.56s)]
*  And I think the peaceful resolution [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4257.84s)]
*  looks something like this. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4259.320000000001s)]
*  You've got to give Israel confidence [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4261.0s)]
*  that Hamas is never going to attack them [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4263.280000000001s)]
*  and kill a bunch of civilians. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4265.4400000000005s)]
*  And then you've got to get as much aid and support [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4267.16s)]
*  into these innocent Palestinians as possible, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4269.4800000000005s)]
*  because in some ways they're caught [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4271.3s)]
*  in the middle of this thing too. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4272.200000000001s)]
*  One thing that I don't love [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4274.4s)]
*  about the whole Israel-Palestinian debate [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4276.64s)]
*  is I think it kind of degrades our humanity a little bit, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4280.3s)]
*  because I've seen people on the left, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4283.36s)]
*  mostly on the left who will say, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4285.56s)]
*  well, they'll completely ignore that Israel, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4286.68s)]
*  like all these innocent Israelis were killed [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4289.56s)]
*  in this terrorist attack. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4291.24s)]
*  And you have some people usually on the right [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4292.32s)]
*  who will completely ignore that they're like kids [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4294.12s)]
*  who are caught up in this violence. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4296.58s)]
*  And I think it's why the president has been, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4298.24s)]
*  I call him the president of peace. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4302.0s)]
*  It's why he cares about solving this problem, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4304.280000000001s)]
*  because the longer this goes on, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4305.320000000001s)]
*  the more suffering, the more death. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4307.240000000001s)]
*  So we're trying to solve it as much as we can. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4308.56s)]
*  It's not easy. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4310.76s)]
*  Do you have a say in it? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4311.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, the president's obviously the person [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4312.76s)]
*  who makes the final decision all the time. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4315.160000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, certainly I think I'm one of the few people [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4317.68s)]
*  that he's talking to constantly. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4321.160000000001s)]
*  We're constantly, we're talking to the Israeli government, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4322.4800000000005s)]
*  we're talking to people in the Arab world, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4325.14s)]
*  we're talking to people in Palestinian territories. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4328.280000000001s)]
*  Like we're constantly engaging in diplomacy. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4330.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, one of the crazy things, dude, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4332.96s)]
*  is this guy is a very dear friend of the president's. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4334.52s)]
*  He's our special envoy of the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4337.76s)]
*  He's a Jewish guy, very pro-Israel. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4340.96s)]
*  He's done more to try to bring this conflict [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4343.4s)]
*  to a close than anybody. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4346.9400000000005s)]
*  And you sometimes have people who say that they're pro-Israel [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4349.08s)]
*  who attack Steve for not being pro-Israel enough. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4352.24s)]
*  And I think it's totally bogus. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4355.4s)]
*  Like I see this guy operate every single day. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4356.92s)]
*  He actually is. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4359.04s)]
*  Like he's a Jewish guy who believes [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4359.88s)]
*  in the purpose of the state of Israel. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4363.4400000000005s)]
*  He also is a guy with a heart [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4366.16s)]
*  who's trying to prevent the killing. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4368.28s)]
*  And I think there's just, like when I talk about [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4370.16s)]
*  this whole debate has caused us to lose our humanity, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4373.16s)]
*  I think of the people who are constantly going after Steve [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4376.8s)]
*  because this is a guy, he's a father, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4379.08s)]
*  he lost one of his own children because of an overdose, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4380.88s)]
*  and he just, he loves people. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4384.4800000000005s)]
*  He believes in the value of human life, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4387.16s)]
*  and he's doing a really good job. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4389.639999999999s)]
*  And he's one of the important people [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4390.5599999999995s)]
*  in the presidency or two. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4391.8s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like, I've heard of Mr. Wittkopf, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4393.719999999999s)]
*  but I never met him. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4396.84s)]
*  But I was like- Good dude. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4397.92s)]
*  You should have him. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4398.759999999999s)]
*  I think the tough thing just as a regular person, right? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4400.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like we're seeing all these videos [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4403.4s)]
*  of people like picking up pieces of their children. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4404.599999999999s)]
*  And like- Of course. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4406.679999999999s)]
*  It's the sickest thing I think it's ever been televised [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4407.5199999999995s)]
*  basically if you consider watching something [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4411.28s)]
*  on your phone being televised. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4412.78s)]
*  It's a very sad man. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4413.62s)]
*  It feels like a massacre. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4415.0s)]
*  And it feels like, you know, I've called it a genocide. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4416.12s)]
*  Other people have different thoughts about it, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4418.4s)]
*  and that's fine, right? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4419.599999999999s)]
*  And I don't need anybody to share the same thoughts [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4420.5199999999995s)]
*  or you two. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4422.48s)]
*  But I think where it gets scary is that we give, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4424.219999999999s)]
*  you know, we're complicit in it [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4426.799999999999s)]
*  because we help fund like military stuff, you know? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4428.4s)]
*  And that's where it's like a regular guy, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4431.44s)]
*  you're like, well, I'm paying these taxes [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4433.4s)]
*  and they're going towards this like, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4435.12s)]
*  but you can't do anything, you know? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4437.5199999999995s)]
*  Like you can, you can talk, you know? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4439.08s)]
*  But it's like, you can't, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4441.839999999999s)]
*  I don't understand how it becomes like tough for people. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4443.2s)]
*  Like sometimes it feels like we look out [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4446.2s)]
*  for the interests of Israel [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4447.56s)]
*  before we look out for the interests of America. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4449.8s)]
*  So let me say a couple of things. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4452.240000000001s)]
*  So number one, like I think you're a great dude, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4453.4800000000005s)]
*  so we'd almost have to agree on everything. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4456.8s)]
*  Do I think it's a genocide? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4459.280000000001s)]
*  No, and here's the reason why I don't think it's a genocide [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4462.0s)]
*  because I don't think that the Israelis [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4464.700000000001s)]
*  are purposely trying to go in and murder every Palestinian. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4466.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think that's what they're doing. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4469.4400000000005s)]
*  I think they got hit hard. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4470.68s)]
*  And I think they're trying to like, you know, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4472.120000000001s)]
*  sort of destroy this terrorist organization [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4474.9s)]
*  and war is hell, and that is true. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4477.74s)]
*  I also think it's true, man. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4480.98s)]
*  I mean, I've seen people on my side of the political aisle, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4482.099999999999s)]
*  I'm a Republican, you know that, but your audience may not, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4484.299999999999s)]
*  who like, will see these videos [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4487.599999999999s)]
*  of these innocent Palestinian kids and say, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4488.9s)]
*  oh, well they had it coming to them. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4491.0199999999995s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4492.54s)]
*  No, like if you have a soul, your heart should break [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4493.42s)]
*  when you see a little kid who's suffering, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4496.9s)]
*  which is why we have the policy that we have, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4499.38s)]
*  which is we're trying to stop, eliminate the conflict, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4501.12s)]
*  eliminate the source of the conflict [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4505.04s)]
*  so that we can actually bring some peace [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4507.12s)]
*  and some humanitarian assistance into people. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4509.0s)]
*  And that's my basic view. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4511.88s)]
*  And the president's interesting. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4514.16s)]
*  He's a very, he's a pro-Israel guy. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4515.88s)]
*  And he also recognizes that to bring any conflict [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4519.38s)]
*  to a close, you've got to talk to everybody. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4522.92s)]
*  And so, I mean, we've been attacked. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4525.4s)]
*  I've been attacked, the president's been attacked [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4526.72s)]
*  for being too interested in diplomacy. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4529.14s)]
*  And you ask like, what can I do? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4531.22s)]
*  I think that what people should demand [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4533.22s)]
*  is that if our tax dollars are going to something, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4535.740000000001s)]
*  we should be actively trying to fix it. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4539.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's kind of the way that I think about it. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4541.780000000001s)]
*  And what happened with the Biden administration, man, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4544.22s)]
*  it's crazy. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4547.02s)]
*  They were spending so much money all over the world. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4548.34s)]
*  They weren't engaged in diplomacy at all. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4551.26s)]
*  So they'd sent, I mean, we sent $300 billion to Ukraine, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4553.58s)]
*  for example, and you never had the president [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4556.62s)]
*  of the United States actually trying [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4559.0599999999995s)]
*  to force a diplomatic settlement. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4559.9s)]
*  When you talk about bodies all over the ground, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4562.1s)]
*  dude, the Russia-Ukraine thing is the most vicious. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4564.98s)]
*  We see satellite images, we see classified images, man. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4568.1s)]
*  It is vicious. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4571.46s)]
*  And again, I will hear people who will say, well, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4572.3s)]
*  again, mostly on our side, they'll say, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4578.18s)]
*  all these, the Russians got killed, that's a good thing. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4579.9s)]
*  Look, I'm not defending the invasion. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4582.78s)]
*  I'm not defending starting a war, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4586.7s)]
*  but when human beings are getting blown to bits, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4589.0599999999995s)]
*  your heart should feel sad about that [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4591.78s)]
*  and you should try to do something to fix it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4593.98s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4595.66s)]
*  And we get crap for it, but again, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4596.62s)]
*  that's like the part that makes me feel the best [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4598.62s)]
*  about my job is whether it's in Israel or Russia-Ukraine, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4600.66s)]
*  like we're actually trying to bring this stuff [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4603.94s)]
*  to some settlement and to some close. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4606.0199999999995s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4608.42s)]
*  And if we don't, it was worth the try. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4610.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4612.38s)]
*  Yeah, I just have one more question. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4614.139999999999s)]
*  And yeah, and I want to say, yeah, I recognize that. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4615.98s)]
*  It's like, you can't expect people to do stuff immediately. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4617.74s)]
*  You can't expect things to happen overnight. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4619.74s)]
*  And that you get into a place [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4621.66s)]
*  and there's a lot of people that are already there [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4622.74s)]
*  and you have to figure out, how do I make my way in this? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4624.299999999999s)]
*  How do I figure out to get some of the things I want [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4627.379999999999s)]
*  and I have to give up some of the things that I also want? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4630.419999999999s)]
*  Right, and so I just want to let you know [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4633.0599999999995s)]
*  that I recognize that, you know, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4634.9s)]
*  and I think I learned to recognize that more. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4636.5s)]
*  I think the older that I get [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  and learn a little bit more about politics, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4638.98s)]
*  it's not just like this guy got the job, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4640.62s)]
*  everything's going to be done immediately. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4642.299999999999s)]
*  I do want to ask really quick, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4644.66s)]
*  this is important because there's a lot, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4645.82s)]
*  like President Trump talked about this, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4647.94s)]
*  he signed this executive order [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4651.099999999999s)]
*  to make price transparency for healthcare, right? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4653.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4657.179999999999s)]
*  And for hospital bills and medical billing. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4658.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4660.5s)]
*  And we talked about it last time you were on, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4661.34s)]
*  you said your wife was getting birthed [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4662.179999999999s)]
*  and you didn't even know like how much it was costing. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4663.34s)]
*  Like, what does this cost? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4665.34s)]
*  And what if we get the amnesia? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4666.179999999999s)]
*  Where your wife's like, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4667.38s)]
*  I don't want any amnesia or whatever. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4668.219999999999s)]
*  And you're like, you should take it. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4669.78s)]
*  And you're like, how much is it? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4670.7s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4671.7s)]
*  But it's like, nobody knows, you know? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4672.54s)]
*  And then they're putting $30,000 of amnesia in your wife. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4674.42s)]
*  And you're like, well, shit. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4676.74s)]
*  And so it's like, but what I'm saying is, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4678.14s)]
*  everybody at this point is, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4680.54s)]
*  but it's a hundred trillion dollar, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4683.58s)]
*  multi hundred trillion dollar industry [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4685.7s)]
*  that's going to change. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4687.66s)]
*  Will we actually see it take place? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4688.9400000000005s)]
*  Like Biden administration tried to get price transparency. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4690.7s)]
*  They were too caught up, they couldn't get it done. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4693.62s)]
*  Trump signed the executive order. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4696.18s)]
*  Do you think we will actually see this happen? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4697.9800000000005s)]
*  So I do. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4700.78s)]
*  I think it's going to take a little time, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4701.78s)]
*  but we took the first big step [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4703.3s)]
*  when the president signed that executive order. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4704.860000000001s)]
*  And you asked this question about donors, right? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4706.42s)]
*  So the pharmaceutical industry gives a ton of money [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4708.860000000001s)]
*  to Republicans and Democrats. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4712.62s)]
*  And I'll tell you, they were not happy [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4714.18s)]
*  when the president did that. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4716.18s)]
*  And the president's attitude is, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4717.22s)]
*  look, it's the right thing for the American people. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4718.3s)]
*  So I think again, it's an example of when [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4720.66s)]
*  you've got to tune out the financial pressures of politics [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4723.42s)]
*  to just do what's right. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4726.3s)]
*  Well, people are afraid to get, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4727.34s)]
*  people are afraid to get sick, not because they, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4728.42s)]
*  sorry, am I being loud to you? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4731.1s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jim. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4731.9400000000005s)]
*  You're fine. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4733.3s)]
*  Here's something. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4734.139999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, your normal volume, I would say. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4735.46s)]
*  Okay, sorry, I felt a little bit. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4737.58s)]
*  It's not towards you. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4738.9s)]
*  I'm thankful that you're spending time with me. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4740.98s)]
*  No, no, you're good, man. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4742.46s)]
*  So I'll tell you a crazy story. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4744.0599999999995s)]
*  A buddy of mine was visiting recently, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4746.66s)]
*  he's a friend from back home. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4751.139999999999s)]
*  And his wife told me this story that his kid, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4753.0199999999995s)]
*  they thought he was special needs, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4755.94s)]
*  maybe he had sort of a neurological disorder [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4758.42s)]
*  just because he was sort of emotional [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4761.42s)]
*  or not emotionally, educationally behind his peers. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4763.3s)]
*  Turns out he was just deaf, he needed a cochlear implant. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4767.3s)]
*  And it took this, my buddy's wife just fighting [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4770.26s)]
*  with the insurance companies for forever [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4775.06s)]
*  to get this kid the medicine that he needed, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4777.26s)]
*  the treatment that he needed. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4779.02s)]
*  And now the kid, he's happy, he's healthy, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4779.86s)]
*  he's a beautiful child, smart child. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4781.9400000000005s)]
*  Like that's amazing, right? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4783.9s)]
*  That's what we want medical science to do [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4785.06s)]
*  is to take a serious problem and make it better. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4787.26s)]
*  Well, why do we have a medical system in this country [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4790.54s)]
*  where too many people can't get the treatment that they need? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4794.94s)]
*  And it's a complicated answer to that question, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4797.26s)]
*  but one of the big problems is, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4800.0199999999995s)]
*  and I don't think most Americans realize this, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4802.42s)]
*  we subsidize. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4804.66s)]
*  When you go to the hospital or you go to the doctor [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4805.86s)]
*  and you pay out the rear end for a treatment, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4807.98s)]
*  you are subsidizing all of the therapies all over the world. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4811.62s)]
*  Tell us what subsidizing means, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4814.78s)]
*  some people won't know. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4815.78s)]
*  So basically we pay more so that Europeans [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4816.62s)]
*  in other parts of the world pay less. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4819.26s)]
*  So we fund all the innovation, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4820.9400000000005s)]
*  we fund all the development of new drugs, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4822.58s)]
*  and then Americans pay way more. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4824.9800000000005s)]
*  That's why Americans, we spend 22% of our economy [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4826.7s)]
*  on healthcare, the Europeans average out about 10 or 11%. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4830.3s)]
*  So we spend way more on healthcare [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4833.9400000000005s)]
*  and they spend way less. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4837.42s)]
*  So the president uses the example all the time, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4838.58s)]
*  the Ozipik, as he calls it the fat shot drug. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4841.22s)]
*  He had a buddy who was on Ozipik [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4844.820000000001s)]
*  and had to go to Canada to get it, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4848.22s)]
*  even though it was invented in Europe [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4850.9800000000005s)]
*  and it was mass produced all over the world, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4854.5s)]
*  it was like a 10th of the price in Canada [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4856.900000000001s)]
*  that it was in the United States. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4859.1s)]
*  And the way that it is is the drug companies [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4860.42s)]
*  make money off Americans [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4862.14s)]
*  so they can offer discount drugs to everybody else. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4863.7s)]
*  So what that executive order, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4865.820000000001s)]
*  the reason why I think that approach is gonna work [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4867.22s)]
*  way better than anything the Biden administration is doing [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4869.14s)]
*  is it's gonna say the Americans get to pay less [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4872.06s)]
*  and the Europeans are gonna have to pay up a little bit, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4875.22s)]
*  you'll know more about what you're spending on, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4877.58s)]
*  but it also is more fair to Americans. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4880.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think that's a win-win scenario [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4882.26s)]
*  because you can't expect Americans to pay 10 times [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4884.98s)]
*  for prescription drugs what other people pay. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4888.34s)]
*  It's also by the way, not that this is the main issue, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4890.22s)]
*  but it's bankrupting people [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4892.58s)]
*  and it's bankrupting our country. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4894.26s)]
*  Because we spend so much more on healthcare [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4895.94s)]
*  and that's a major driver of our budgetary problem. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4898.18s)]
*  It's a number one cause of bankruptcy is medical debt. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4901.18s)]
*  And it's like people aren't afraid to get sick [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4903.18s)]
*  because they'll be sick, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4904.86s)]
*  they're afraid to get sick [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4905.74s)]
*  because they can't afford to be sick. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4906.54s)]
*  And the stress of it is gonna kill them. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4908.26s)]
*  But do you think like he made the executive order, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4910.22s)]
*  do you think we'll, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4912.0599999999995s)]
*  and I know it's like so hard to be like you, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4912.9s)]
*  do you know, but it's like, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4914.5s)]
*  do you really think we'll see this? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4916.42s)]
*  I mean, it's like, God, give us, give the people something. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4918.78s)]
*  I do, I do. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4921.22s)]
*  And we got a great secretary [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4922.38s)]
*  of Health and Human Services, Bobby Kennedy. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4923.5s)]
*  Have you done, has Bobby been on the show before? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4925.9s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4927.78s)]
*  He's a good dude. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4928.7s)]
*  We had Bobby when everybody thought he was insane, dude. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4929.54s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4932.139999999999s)]
*  He had to give him a ride home. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4934.7s)]
*  All vehicle had been repossessed. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4937.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4938.66s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4941.26s)]
*  I'm joking. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4942.099999999999s)]
*  So Bobby, Bobby's a good- [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4942.94s)]
*  Congratulations, Bobby. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4943.78s)]
*  Yeah, we should have known that [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4944.62s)]
*  for the Senate confirmation hearings. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4945.46s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, Bobby's a good dude [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4946.7s)]
*  and he really cares about this stuff. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4948.58s)]
*  And this is what you need. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4950.7s)]
*  You need the will, you need the good idea, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4951.54s)]
*  but you also need the implementation. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4953.98s)]
*  I think the president's got the good idea. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4955.82s)]
*  He's got the executive order. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4957.78s)]
*  Bobby's got the implementation. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4959.3s)]
*  So like, look, am I gonna tell you sitting here [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4961.139999999999s)]
*  that all of our healthcare problems [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4963.7s)]
*  are gonna be fixed in 12 months? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4965.0199999999995s)]
*  No. Right. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4966.179999999999s)]
*  But do I think that this is gonna make [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4967.0199999999995s)]
*  prescription drugs way more affordable [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4968.54s)]
*  over the longterm? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4970.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4971.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4972.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I know a lot of people might be critical [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4974.66s)]
*  of this interview and stuff. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4976.26s)]
*  It's like, I'm doing my best, right? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4977.099999999999s)]
*  I'm trying my best and maybe I'm just too hard [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4978.34s)]
*  on myself sometimes. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4980.0599999999995s)]
*  Why would, critical interview? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4981.62s)]
*  Cause I'm a politician and like, it's partisan. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4982.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think people expect, I don't know. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4985.74s)]
*  But you would have a Democrat on. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4987.0599999999995s)]
*  Huh? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4988.26s)]
*  You would have a Democrat on. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4989.099999999999s)]
*  We got Tim Walls coming on. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4989.92s)]
*  Oh nice. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4990.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4991.599999999999s)]
*  That'll be interesting. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4992.58s)]
*  But no, I never met him. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4994.3s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4995.14s)]
*  We got him coming on. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4995.98s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, I'm definitely trying [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4996.82s)]
*  to learn more about it. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4998.02s)]
*  Honestly, he's a nice guy. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=4998.86s)]
*  But I think that's what- [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5000.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not a, you know, I don't know [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5001.54s)]
*  the history of everything, right? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5004.02s)]
*  So it's like, I feel like we're just trying [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5006.14s)]
*  to do our best and I'm trying to do my best [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5007.78s)]
*  with somebody who I consider a friend and yeah. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5009.54s)]
*  And to learn in as we go. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5012.62s)]
*  Anyway, anything else particular that you wanted [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5013.54s)]
*  to say that you needed to get out to people? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5015.94s)]
*  I don't think so, man. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5017.98s)]
*  I think we've covered a lot. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5018.82s)]
*  Hopefully I didn't get myself in too much trouble here. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5019.64s)]
*  But- [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5021.58s)]
*  What are you talking about, dude? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5022.7s)]
*  I think you're good. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5023.74s)]
*  I'm trying to think of anything else, dude. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5024.82s)]
*  But you think Trey Hendrickson will get signed? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5026.86s)]
*  That's the million dollar question [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5030.5s)]
*  or I guess the $50 million question. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5032.0599999999995s)]
*  Are y'all going to subsidize that? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5033.86s)]
*  Is that part of the big- [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5034.86s)]
*  That's actually unknown. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5036.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a big part of the big, beautiful will. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5038.62s)]
*  What if that was- [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5040.38s)]
*  Is $30 million to the Bengals [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5041.22s)]
*  to help with salary cap space? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5042.46s)]
*  I mean, look, so Hendrickson is- [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5044.1s)]
*  He's worth it, dude. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5046.5s)]
*  Dude, he's a generational talent. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5047.34s)]
*  It's very hard to get a guy like that. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5049.18s)]
*  It's kind of crazy how, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5050.94s)]
*  like I'm a big football fan, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5052.139999999999s)]
*  but edge rushers have become, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5053.379999999999s)]
*  it's almost like where left tackles were [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5055.9s)]
*  10 or 15 years ago, where everybody just realized [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5057.86s)]
*  there's this really underpaid position [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5060.179999999999s)]
*  that you got to have. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5062.7s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think we're going to have to pay Hendrickson. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5064.219999999999s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5066.58s)]
*  If he's, here's what I'll say to Trey. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5067.54s)]
*  If you're watching this show, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5070.54s)]
*  if you're a Republican, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5072.139999999999s)]
*  I will show up to a Bengals game [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5074.379999999999s)]
*  and take a photo with you [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5075.98s)]
*  if you sign on with the Bengals. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5077.179999999999s)]
*  And if you're a Democrat, I'll stay the hell away. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5078.58s)]
*  Just sign with the Bengals because we got a chance, man. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5080.46s)]
*  I keep, I say this every year, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5083.22s)]
*  but with Burrow, with Jamar Chase, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5084.82s)]
*  if we get our defense and our offensive line, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5087.02s)]
*  we could have a true championship run. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5089.9s)]
*  It's exciting. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5091.9s)]
*  Well, I just appreciate you coming and spending time with me, man. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5092.82s)]
*  Thank you very much to Bob Richie, Kid Rock [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5095.22s)]

*  Thanks for having me, dude. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5106.1s)]
*  You too, brother. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5106.92s)]
*  Now I'm just floating on the breeze [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5108.400000000001s)]
*  and I feel I'm falling like these leaves [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5111.04s)]
*  I must be cornerstone [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5113.96s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5119.2s)]
*  I'll share this piece of mind I found [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5121.92s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5124.72s)]
*  But it's gonna take [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJsQk4rbBw&t=5129.360000000001s)]
