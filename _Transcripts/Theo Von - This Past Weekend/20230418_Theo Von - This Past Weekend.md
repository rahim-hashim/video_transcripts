*  There's nothing I can do about it [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1677.24s)]
*  There's nothing I can do about it I felt like something's so wrong with me that I have like I've overrided [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1679.0s)]
*  Like cuz we're designed to survive [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  I'd overrided the desire to survive like when you're like when you want pills and drugs more than you [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1689.3999999999999s)]
*  inherently want to [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1698.12s)]
*  Like make it through the day. That's some weird [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1700.24s)]
*  Reverse evolutionary shit [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1704.24s)]
*  Yeah for your brain to basically be able to run the scenario and go we haven't slept in four days [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1706.24s)]
*  We chain smoke we eat Sour Patch Kids. We'd never drink water [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  We're blowing tons of coke [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1719.28s)]
*  This isn't gonna last and you go. I think I think we're gonna keep on [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1721.36s)]
*  Think we're gonna keep doing this [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1725.44s)]
*  So you were deep in how'd you get so deep in because I don't think anyone [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1728.64s)]
*  Would look at you and think this is the [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1733.36s)]
*  Coke guy good. That was the whole thing [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1736.8s)]
*  I mean, I certainly tried to talk about it on stage as having had like a [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1740.2s)]
*  Drug and alcohol problem, but it just I don't know. Yeah, I didn't something about me seems [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1746.4s)]
*  So to me, it's like well, of course the guy that seems like he has it all together has the problem [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1753.56s)]
*  Because that's just like how life is it's text. Yeah, it's almost like this textbook. Yeah [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1759.48s)]
*  But that's I don't put that on other I don't put that on you to be like [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1767.0s)]
*  How come you didn't see it that because I was I also I really thought like I [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1770.64s)]
*  Really thought that I was doing life [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1776.08s)]
*  I was able to achieve it life with the drugs as opposed to in spite of them took me a [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1778.28s)]
*  Long time over the past couple years to realize that I did well at what I do in spite of drugs not because of them Wow [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1784.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, cuz it would be fun. Yeah from an outsider. I would always look at him and be like, oh that guy [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1791.8s)]
*  Yeah drugs would not help that guy [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1797.08s)]
*  Like that guy is his own [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1799.8s)]
*  he is so unique in his own way that anything to [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1802.1599999999999s)]
*  like a [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1806.84s)]
*  Base that or something or debase that we only mess him up [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1808.84s)]
*  But I would have saw I would have thought like I'm delivering something people really like and I think I'm delivering it because I take [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1812.24s)]
*  230 milligram Adderalls and then one Z bar and so I'm really sharp, but I don't seem jittery and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1818.64s)]
*  So I go on a podcast or I go on a talk show [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1824.64s)]
*  I'm just I'm delivering and I'm giving people what I'm naturally good at but I'm a little tired so I can't naturally do it [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1827.88s)]
*  So it's okay. It's okay to take it's okay to rip open time release Adderall and dump the beads down my throat and [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1834.6s)]
*  Pop a clone up in because then I will get to the level that I naturally am at [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1842.64s)]
*  Like I just got to deliver what I'm good at and right now we're running on a lean mixture [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1847.52s)]
*  And it used to be easier, but now it's harder. So whatever I'm putting in my body to get to that is fine [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1852.32s)]
*  That's like a acceptable, you know acceptable [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1859.36s)]
*  You're like your own you're like your own Geppetto almost in a weird way. Let me think about that [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1864.06s)]
*  How do you? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1868.8s)]
*  In what way like you were [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1870.4s)]
*  Because if you were kind of running if you wanted to get yourself you were a little burnt out [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1874.0800000000002s)]
*  You're trying to get yourself to the place where everybody loves you at and where you know, you operate best at [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1877.92s)]
*  So yeah, I wanted to be like I'd see myself [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1882.92s)]
*  Never see up. I'd sometimes see a clip me like I need to be like of myself and be like I need to be like that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1885.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, how do I get how that guy's confident has a bunch of things to say? Yeah [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1890.68s)]
*  How did he get the how did I how did he have the thoughts oh [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1897.26s)]
*  Yeah, I thought look man. I miss my old self sometimes [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1900.8600000000001s)]
*  You're you're using self. No just myself like a few years ago. Yeah [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1904.94s)]
*  There was some yeah, that's what it I was chasing something. There was some moment maybe [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1910.98s)]
*  You know like 2007 I didn't know what it was but I was like I had some [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1917.52s)]
*  Electricity in my eyes. Yeah, where you know, wow, it's so funny [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1922.3400000000001s)]
*  I got to get back to that and I just got to get back to that and I just got to get back to that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1925.88s)]
*  Yeah, I got you somehow it'll happen somehow. I'll find the right amount [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1928.5800000000002s)]
*  For real, you know, like I'm 100% serious. I that's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1932.94s)]
*  That yeah, that's what I think all the time. I look at old things and I'm like, oh man, I miss that guy. Yep [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1937.3000000000002s)]
*  That was a yeah, that's a really entertaining person. Yeah, and I don't even put it on [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1943.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't even mean like and I and I people demanded I'm not acting like I [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1948.8999999999999s)]
*  Couldn't have taken a break and you know, it's not like the audience demanded this and not at all [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1953.58s)]
*  It was what I wanted to do. It's what I write. Oh, yeah. I don't yeah, I don't get that perception [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1957.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, okay, but it's interesting. Yeah, I wanted to get back to him. I wanted to feel back to myself [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1962.1s)]
*  I wanted to be like that guy was so creative and original [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1966.82s)]
*  I know now I think some of it take drugs because you want to feel like you're 12 or 13 again [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1970.2199999999998s)]
*  It's a little messed up it's a little messed up, but it also makes sense [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1976.16s)]
*  I think if you for me it's some of that goes back to I think I know I felt like I [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1979.66s)]
*  Missed out on some childhood. So I part of me wants to get back to that. I think there's some psycho [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  Psycho out on it just missed out on like having some moments of childhood that would have felt more comfortable and fun. Okay [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1992.2s)]
*  but I think part of it is I [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=1998.72s)]
*  I [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2002.2800000000002s)]
*  Used to like the element of surprise when people didn't know me. Uh-huh [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2004.28s)]
*  You had an element of surprise to people. Yeah, and there were and there was something that was [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2009.44s)]
*  Nice about that it was like [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2017.0s)]
*  It made you be able to be the only one who presented you to people [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2020.84s)]
*  Yeah, and then as you get more popular, I think is the term that I'll use or where people have seen more of you [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2025.92s)]
*  Then there's some expectations or the this the the thing of surprise [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2034.48s)]
*  Which made me feel like unique that I can just be the controller of me [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2039.52s)]
*  Yeah, that goes away because people have already seen you and have some interpretation of you. Mm-hmm. And so I think [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2044.44s)]
*  this all may sound really egomaniacal, but that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2052.84s)]
*  bummed me out a little bit because I think the only thing I ever felt like I had when I was growing up was myself [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2056.72s)]
*  Okay, and so I wanted to be able to authentically present that as much as I could. Yeah and [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2063.68s)]
*  And that goes away as you get more people have seen you. Does that make any sense? A hundred percent. Okay [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2070.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what it means dude people used to have stage names for a reason [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2076.56s)]
*  because you know, they could go home and be like [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2081.88s)]
*  You know Johnny starlight is the guy on stage [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2085.08s)]
*  John Mulaney is me the person who I you know the person like I gotta say I [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2088.16s)]
*  Don't [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2095.64s)]
*  You know, there's some real destructive part of me that I've worked on a lot [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2096.8399999999997s)]
*  But I wouldn't say I have low self-esteem day to day, which is a really nice thing [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2100.88s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like you do either [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2106.8399999999997s)]
*  So it it becomes like [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2109.88s)]
*  You know, I like myself [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2112.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, if you like yourself and then yourself is out there in the world and [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2114.76s)]
*  And they seem like you just got to think of them as two different things [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2119.08s)]
*  I'm not saying this that articulately people had stage names because they could be like well, that's something else. That's not me [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2122.92s)]
*  That's not the little kid. I was right [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think now comes from like those people would have fake names because they'd read a review of themselves and it wasn't their real name [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  So they'd be like, oh, that's not me. Right? That's a thing [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2138.6s)]
*  Now we're so it's hard you now everybody knows everything about you [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2142.6000000000004s)]
*  Within reason. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to detact. It's hard to keep some things to yourself. It's even hard to [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2146.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2153.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, though. I mean, whatever whatever people put out. There is also right who knows if it's real or not [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2155.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like it used to be like, um [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2161.32s)]
*  Like I remember we loved Michael Landon growing up, right? We had drawings of them and once a year my way you have highway to heaven [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2164.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you have highway to heaven behind you. Oh, yeah, we meaning your family. I mean it's whatever whatever [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2170.6s)]
*  Political party builds that dude. I'm voting for him. I'll tell you that you know [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2178.2799999999997s)]
*  He was dying through my whole childhood it felt like like Michael Landon [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2184.08s)]
*  like I just remember being a kid and being at the supermarket and like [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2189.3199999999997s)]
*  Every National Enquirer was like Michael Landon's final battle and I was just like is this person I didn't even know he was an actor [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2192.92s)]
*  I thought he might be famously ill like just a guy in a jean jacket who was always sick [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2199.46s)]
*  Because I never saw Bonanza till like it was on Nick at night and then [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2204.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2209.82s)]
*  There he is. God look at him [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2211.18s)]
*  So what you were into Michael Landon from we loved him from Little House on the Prairie. Oh [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2214.1s)]
*  God, we love you. You know, it's crazy. One of the first times I learned about drug withdrawal was from Little House on the Prairie [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2219.98s)]
*  Oh, I know what episode you're talking about. Yeah [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2226.54s)]
*  Fucking crazy that episode. I know nothing about Little House on the Prairie, but I saw that once [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2229.5s)]
*  I think Michael Landon stays up with the kid who's on opium and yeah sweats it out [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2234.38s)]
*  It's like Basketball Diaries level it really is in the middle of whatever the hell else used to happen on that show cooking stew [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2239.38s)]
*  Or whatever Walnut Grove. Yeah a lot of like I mean that's when pink eye you would lose a twin to pink eye [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2245.14s)]
*  Our one episode they had would be born with pink eye and it was a real [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2253.06s)]
*  You lose one yeah, there it is that's Albert Engels right there [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2256.5s)]
*  He was addicted was that that care so I know nothing about the show was that that characters whole deal [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2259.86s)]
*  Was that he was a morphine addict or was that just a special episode? No, he was adopted and so he had this kind of like [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2264.62s)]
*  interesting like [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=2270.26s)]

*  Oh, I tried to give her a smooch right and I wasn't being aggressive or anything. She was flirting [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3235.54s)]

*  So the only thing in my life I'd had to express myself with my voice. Yeah, and suddenly I couldn't use it [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3456.0s)]
*  Okay, and you had and your mind what you now had to use because you were gonna be interviewed on the radio [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3461.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3467.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's real scary and then also this moment of seeing Darrell strawberry someone who I had always thought was all coked out of his brain [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3467.6000000000004s)]
*  Sure, cuz that's all I'd ever heard. Right was the old stories [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3473.4s)]
*  I didn't know that he was a sober guy and had his deal together. Oh, yeah [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3476.52s)]
*  I assumed he had his deal together, but I did think he'd be able to spot you still. Yeah [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3480.72s)]
*  I didn't know what I thought I think okay, you know [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3484.72s)]
*  Which I don't know if that even makes any sense [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3486.76s)]
*  But there was some alignment at that moment of like me not having control over my voice [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3488.4s)]
*  Me having a perception of somebody else that was false or something sure and that just lined up and [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3494.52s)]
*  You hadn't slept and you were on cocaine. Yeah [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3500.32s)]
*  But that lined up for me that I needed something whatever that like like like the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3503.0s)]
*  With that thing you tighten with the colors in it kaleidoscope [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3509.96s)]
*  Whatever the kaleidoscope is that it makes people have to realize that something is wrong [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3512.96s)]
*  Yeah, though that was the moment where it was like, oh, that's interesting. I could see right down [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3517.04s)]
*  Those things never made me [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3523.04s)]
*  Those like being in Midtown, Manhattan have a meeting have a [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3526.2s)]
*  Big like production meeting on something [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3531.2s)]
*  And you could be get there get there half hour late [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3534.24s)]
*  Desperate to have a cigarette so like finding an abandoned office and smoking out the window and being almost very much in trouble [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3539.6s)]
*  And it being really clear those moments were so about surviving that that hour [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3546.48s)]
*  That they never thought about them with any deeper perspective. I never thought oh my god. What has my life become? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3552.04s)]
*  I was just like I [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3557.8s)]
*  It would be easier to take the train I'd be faster to take the train home to my cocaine [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3560.84s)]
*  But I can't do coke on the train. So it was all just like [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3565.0400000000004s)]
*  Figuring out the video game of being a drug addict. Wow took up. It was just a scramble [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3568.8s)]
*  For the present problem and as soon as that problem was solved. I moved on I wasn't like I can't believe you know [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3573.7200000000003s)]
*  I remember I went I went into a meeting [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3580.76s)]
*  Holding a bottle of Pedialyte because I was not eating anything. I was just drinking Pedialyte doing cocaine [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3584.6s)]
*  And I was I was with people I knew and we were waiting for other people to join the meeting that we didn't know [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3590.96s)]
*  And I said if my nose bleeds or if I pass out it's because I have a sinus infection [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3595.04s)]
*  Don't worry, you know, and I'll give a signal if I think I'm about to pass out and then [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3600.68s)]
*  Then and I even to them I was like because I'm sick, right? That's why [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3605.96s)]

*  Something like I got you know Geronimo [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3620.24s)]
*  Would be a great thing to say before you pass out and your nose explodes with blood that that covered it well [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3625.3999999999996s)]

*  Were you getting too big and pot were you getting too popular that people were even afraid to question you and kind of thing [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3646.86s)]
*  Did I don't think so, right? I don't think so [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3651.7200000000003s)]

*  was been very lucky with [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3657.38s)]
*  I've been very lucky with having [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3660.1s)]
*  an audience that's grown and grown but you know [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3662.9s)]
*  You got a that that's a certain level before no one will question you right? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3666.46s)]
*  I don't have that level I was on TV sometimes but I wasn't like, you know, right I wasn't [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3671.1000000000004s)]
*  Steven Spielberg's yeah, Michael Landon. Yeah, I wasn't some Michael Landon who a bunch of yes men telling me doesn't need to show up to the [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3678.42s)]
*  state fair [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3685.78s)]
*  That shook us man [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3688.78s)]
*  What do you have a lot of people? Did you have a lot of people around who knew about your problem? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3690.5400000000004s)]
*  I have family members. It's like addiction is in my family. So [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3694.78s)]
*  there's um [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3699.86s)]
*  So I remember I would drive by the AA [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3702.98s)]
*  There's an AA room down the street from where I stay in Los Angeles and I would drive by there [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3706.5s)]
*  You can do the parking lot sometimes and one time a family member of mine was like, you know [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3710.9s)]
*  Normal people aren't driving [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3715.9s)]
*  Through the parking lot of AA meetings to see what's going on, right? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3718.06s)]
*  so there was something inside of me that wondered and the biggest thing for me is a mo is like it like [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3721.78s)]
*  Make trying to keep my emotions sober. Like I wasn't insane. Like I definitely partied some I [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3727.78s)]
*  Don't drink because I'm afraid if I have a beer, I'm gonna go get cocaine. I have never had a drinking problem [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3734.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna take one sip and then it just gives me an excuse to get coke, right? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3739.1s)]
*  But mine was just always like thinking something was wrong with me. I always felt like [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3743.54s)]
*  I've always felt like something like there's a to-do list that I never even wrote [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3749.5s)]
*  yeah, that I'm responsible to do and [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3755.02s)]
*  The pain the energy of the responsibility of it is always every day when I wake up [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3758.18s)]
*  I'm like I gotta go. I just have to do so always have to do so that it's just I have to prove [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3763.94s)]
*  I'm trying to prove myself to nothing. Yeah, I don't even know what it is [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3768.54s)]
*  So that was something in my life that made it tough [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3773.38s)]
*  That just exhausted me, you know, so a lot of my stuff came from that kind of thing like [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3776.62s)]
*  Just feeling inferior trying to always make like I I'd fall in love with a girl [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3782.46s)]
*  And then the second I if I got a date with her the second I did there was some other girl [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3786.66s)]
*  It was like just always needed more always needed something else. There was always a missing piece to me being okay [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3790.7s)]
*  Yeah, and there was no there was never a piece I could find that was gonna make it that would fit [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3796.46s)]
*  There's no piece out there. It was just there was something wrong with my program a little bit [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3802.58s)]
*  How did you feel at that time? Did you feel like? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3806.94s)]
*  Other shit needs to other people and other things need to fall into place. So I'm happy or did you feel like it was on you? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3810.34s)]
*  You know people who blame the outside world. Yeah, they go. Yeah. My problem is that [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3816.9s)]
*  People come into my life and create stressful situations or that thing of like if you meet one asshole one day you met an asshole [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3822.1s)]
*  If you meet an asshole every day, you're the asshole. Mmm. I think that happened kind of later the like [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3828.2200000000003s)]
*  But early on it was just I'm not doing well enough. I'm not doing enough to be okay for myself [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3834.82s)]
*  Was what it turned into? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3841.1800000000003s)]
*  Doing enough like in your career in anything something [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3844.02s)]
*  Yeah, and it was always this the invisible thing like [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3848.14s)]
*  Nothing was ever I couldn't manage well enough to make things. Okay, uh-huh. Even if I was managing great, you know [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3852.8599999999997s)]
*  And I couldn't enjoy I was never I was never enjoying myself. I was always caught up [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3860.62s)]
*  How can things be different or better or you know? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3865.62s)]
*  so a lot of that stuff for me a lot of like [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3870.3399999999997s)]
*  Not even knowing who I was like I need to [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3873.9s)]
*  Needing you to let me know who I was if I was okay. Yeah for sure all that kind of stuff. So [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3877.1800000000003s)]
*  the drugs was just I think I [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3883.42s)]
*  Like drugs because I like cocaine because it I could feel how I wanted to immediately [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3886.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, of course like liquor and beer and stuff. It's like [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3891.6600000000003s)]
*  That was just a bunch of damn [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3895.7000000000003s)]
*  Just yeah, it's it postpones shit. Yes. I wanted the express train. I wanted to feel how I wanted to feel right now [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3898.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh my god. Yeah, but then I would get by we getting I would end up by myself looking at pornography [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3904.52s)]
*  You know just geeked out [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3910.52s)]
*  Looking at hookers just it always devolved into some weird space for me too. And well, yeah, and you're chasing some [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3913.2s)]
*  You're chasing. I mean people say you're chasing the first time you did cocaine. I don't think that's true. You're just chasing the [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3920.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're chasing the first line that night. Oh, yeah, and if I think about doing cocaine say if I think about it, right? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3926.04s)]

*  Yeah, the next thing I think about doing is another line of cocaine. Oh, of course. I don't think about enjoying the party [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3944.94s)]
*  I don't think about if you know, uh, no, I think about getting a bat. I mean I just go okay [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3951.48s)]
*  Well, all right now we need a bag of this and [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3956.1400000000003s)]
*  Fewer people that know about it the better. Yeah [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3959.5s)]
*  Now that was a fun thing too is the secret espionage side of it. It was almost like you were my god [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3962.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you were like the the bad guy that everybody was looking you talk about the Craigslist thing [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3967.42s)]
*  I mean there was a guy I don't know guy. I was a Craigslist ad that someone was selling Adderall in LA [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3972.02s)]
*  The ad was written like home from finals and have all this leftover Adderall and I remember thinking [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3978.94s)]
*  Remember thinking how can I pull up? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3985.3s)]
*  And I was like, how will I know if it's a sting? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3988.98s)]
*  And also I kept thinking like this is a pretty low stakes sting for the LA County Sheriff's Office to be behind [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3991.94s)]
*  Like to want to meet in a recreational park to sell someone ten Adderall. It's a lot of manpower [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=3999.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah on a pretty small movement [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4005.98s)]
*  And then I thought will it help or hurt that I'm a little famous [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4009.38s)]
*  like when I pull up will it be more like [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4014.78s)]
*  Could I yeah, will I be more noticeable or [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4017.42s)]
*  Will that become a distracting thing like officers I'm just you know, of course, it's not me I [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4022.54s)]

*  Had a dealer once who preferred to deal in front of police [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4090.26s)]
*  Who preferred to deal in front of police stations on the theory that if he got jumped he would rather be close to police [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4095.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess so wasn't the most fun [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4102.0199999999995s)]

*  The husky would kind of come up and just go around the car [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4132.099999999999s)]
*  You had to keep the windows down to make sure there weren't other people in the car [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4134.179999999999s)]
*  I think just you know, I think you know [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4137.5199999999995s)]
*  The first time he brought the dog in just in the sat in the back of the vehicle [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4139.74s)]
*  Okay, the dog we get to know your smell, right? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4143.0199999999995s)]

*  I was just paranoid right and then one time he gets in man, and he just starts crying [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4154.54s)]
*  The dog [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4160.900000000001s)]
*  The guy the man [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4166.34s)]
*  The guy I don't know if I'd have been able to know I maybe I could have noticed if the dog was crying [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4168.34s)]
*  but I don't know if I could have but the man got in and [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4172.5s)]

*  Yeah, and the dude is crying man. It's just some moments like that where you just like what is going on? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4256.34s)]
*  I don't know how to handle this. Well, I will say there's a lot of factors in that story and in [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4262.42s)]
*  Yes, you know you could have had more empathy in the moment but [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4269.740000000001s)]
*  He's also a drug dealer who brings a husky into your car and Willis is sitting in the backseat. So it's an odd situation [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4273.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like anyone else would have handled it a lot better [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4278.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I always took odd situations like that. Like it was totally normal. I think and I still have yeah 100% nothing about that [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4283.54s)]
*  Nothing about those things. I remember thinking like god the day is how do people get through their day with all these meetups? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4289.3s)]
*  They have to do. Yeah [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4295.18s)]
*  Cocaine dealers you mean? Yeah, just like you know, yeah buying pills. I was like man [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4297.780000000001s)]
*  I was like what I can barely I got a call but I'm supposed to meet this person before I'm not gonna [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4302.22s)]
*  You know how many business calls I did on mute [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4306.860000000001s)]
*  You know like on a street corner being like thank you said six. You said six. You said six. Yeah. Okay, cool [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4309.820000000001s)]

*  No, like we'd love the script you said six. I was like [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4321.1s)]
*  It was a real [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4325.58s)]
*  It was exhausting it was exhausting [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4328.46s)]
*  Yeah, but it kept you in the moment. I'll say that I had reflexes like an alley cat. Yeah, you know, like yeah could grab this [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4331.42s)]
*  It was like [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4337.9800000000005s)]
*  People meditate to be in the moment, you know, like when people do like mindfulness meditation [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4339.5s)]
*  It's to be fully present and like when I was trying to get drugs [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4344.38s)]
*  I was full I was like, okay bird siren off in the distance bicycle. That's the second time that I was like [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4348.22s)]
*  Bicycle that's the second time like every single thing. We're here. Yeah. Yeah, it did put you right there put you right there [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4353.82s)]
*  There was some immediacy. God damn it. Maybe there was something about that that I really liked about it [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4360.0599999999995s)]
*  That it puts you right like [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4365.5s)]
*  Because now I will say this i've thought a lot about the moment right? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4367.82s)]
*  Like the moment doesn't exist as much as it used to the moment [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4371.9s)]
*  It used to be if something happened it wasn't recorded all the time [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4375.0199999999995s)]
*  It wasn't captured on a phone [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4378.7s)]
*  If you had a good story, you had to get to your friends and tell it [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4380.7s)]
*  Yeah, and if somebody else had a good story you had to get them to the party that he dude listen to what happened to run [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4384.06s)]
*  Right. Yeah, and that was the only way and the moment was like [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4390.06s)]
*  It wasn't able to be captured, right? Okay, so it had so much value [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4394.86s)]
*  whereas now all moments are captured, right so it's like [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4400.86s)]
*  There is not as much value to them in a way [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4405.42s)]
*  because they're [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4408.86s)]
*  Yeah, well, do you think that's [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4411.58s)]
*  The capturing of it like you mean you can get a photo or a video of it [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4413.58s)]
*  Or do you think that as we get older we just had so many moments they become [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4416.94s)]
*  I don't know. They just become a little less. It's a good point like time like time people say that about time [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4422.86s)]
*  That's a really that's a really good point [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4427.66s)]
*  Like time when you're young everything takes so long, but when you're older it takes [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4429.5s)]
*  It goes faster because you've done it so many times. Yeah [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4433.74s)]
*  Like the most [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4437.42s)]
*  I mean we both get to do really exciting things but we've done versions of them before [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4438.78s)]
*  And you go. Oh, this is [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4444.94s)]
*  Yeah, okay. This is how I thought this is what I thought it might be like [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4446.78s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, it's the same feeling as [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4450.0599999999995s)]
*  You know the moment [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4452.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think I never take stock in the moment. Really? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4455.0199999999995s)]
*  I never do I I just like [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4459.099999999999s)]
*  Never [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4461.98s)]
*  like [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4463.42s)]
*  Playing the world's greatest venue or I never I mean, you know I later I I can appreciate those things [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4464.3s)]
*  But I never have uh, I remember I was down, uh [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4470.46s)]
*  In the bottom of patagonia in chile and it was like all glaciers three hours from antarctica [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4474.62s)]
*  I was just staring at the sun setting over all these glaciers and I was saying to myself like try to enjoy this [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4481.02s)]
*  Try to enjoy this try to enjoy this just [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4486.3s)]
*  Just I later I appreciated it, but i'm never really [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4489.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh my god, do you think that the world is boring to you and this is in the judgment of you. This is like [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4494.54s)]
*  sometimes as uh [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4500.78s)]
*  I think as somebody who's been in and out of recovery and stuff like that [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4503.18s)]
*  I've noticed at times that I looked at the world in ways the world always felt a little bit boring to me [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4507.26s)]
*  Um, I used to have that. Yeah [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4513.9800000000005s)]
*  I I did. Um [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4515.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think or that boring or that boring? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4517.9800000000005s)]
*  Not that the world was always boring, excuse me, but that boring was the absolute worst state [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4521.820000000001s)]
*  to be in [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4526.3s)]
*  Boredom was intolerable [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4527.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4529.900000000001s)]
*  And it's tough if you have a creative mind because a creative mind can get kind of bored kind of easy because it can think of different [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4532.22s)]
*  things [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4537.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so it has more toys to play with you know, I also have a thing so [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4538.860000000001s)]
*  It's less like you were saying you had kind of a the grass is greener [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4543.1s)]
*  Envy for you always wanted more some other scenario. I also [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4547.1s)]
*  I [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4551.18s)]
*  reached a point where I felt [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4553.02s)]
*  um [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4555.660000000001s)]
*  I felt very satisfied. I remember I was doing this tour in [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4557.42s)]
*  2017 [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4562.120000000001s)]
*  And I was on stage at a theater in st. Louis [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4564.06s)]
*  And it was sold out [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4567.5s)]
*  And it was a tuesday, you know, it wasn't like and I remember when I first went to the comedy seller [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4569.18s)]
*  Rock or one of these guys being like anyone can sell out on the weekend wait till you sell out on a wednesday or a tuesday [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4575.1s)]
*  So i'm on stage and it felt like the end of the movie comedian, you know the documentary seinfeld [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4580.06s)]
*  Which when I saw that I was like, that's what I want [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4585.42s)]
*  I want to stand in a theater and do stand-up like that's what I want [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4587.660000000001s)]
*  And then I was doing it and I thought it wasn't a bad feeling [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4590.700000000001s)]
*  But the feeling was okay [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4594.860000000001s)]
*  This is it. This is all this is kind of as big as I pictured [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4598.06s)]
*  Like and i'm doing it and that's great. Right, but I had a slight feeling of [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4602.700000000001s)]
*  I don't know [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4608.3s)]
*  Okay, I don't know. What's next [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4610.14s)]
*  Like I was a bit um [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4613.02s)]
*  I started I started to freak out because I was kind of sat. I was a little satisfied [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4616.38s)]
*  Yeah, but I but I don't want to I don't want to make it seem like it was a good feeling. It was an odd feeling [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4621.34s)]
*  Yeah, or sort of this is it this is what I wanted and it's pretty cool, right but having a goal really kept me [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4628.38s)]
*  Occupied and I wasn't sure if I had another one. Wow [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4637.88s)]
*  dude, that sounds like a great entry to [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4642.54s)]
*  like a murder like a [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4645.82s)]
*  Detective scenario having a goal really kept me. Yeah having a goal kept me moving and I and I [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4647.88s)]
*  Reached it. Yeah, it seemed like I mean it was a very very lucky goal. I got a p man. Yeah [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4654.14s)]
*  I'm gonna be real fast. Okay, cool. You're right 100 percent. All right, um [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4661.34s)]
*  When you think about like your so I think that these days there's kind of like two can I ask you something else about addiction? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4666.14s)]
*  Go ahead. Okay [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4672.14s)]
*  I think there's like two types of addiction that I notice I notice people that are like [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4673.74s)]
*  Alcoholics right like they have what is in like the the big book of alcoholism. You know what I'm talking about? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4681.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, they have the disease of alcoholism [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4687.5s)]
*  Then I also noticed there's this other group who have opioid addiction, right? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4689.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and it's not I'm not saying that some of them couldn't also have alcoholism [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4694.860000000001s)]
*  No, but there's something about the I mean there's something so insidious about opioids and how they get in people's wiring. Yeah that [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4699.1s)]
*  You're not I [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4707.5s)]
*  Don't want to get into the whole like willpower and disease and I know that a lot of people have a lot of feelings about [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4709.66s)]
*  That all of them valid [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4715.3s)]
*  But you're not choosing to take that opioid like that. That is [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4717.18s)]
*  Science fiction level shit the way it gets into people's [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4722.26s)]
*  You know limbic system and like you cannot stop taking them you are in agony and is that and that just seems like [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4726.900000000001s)]
*  That just seems like some other [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4735.78s)]
*  There should be a different word for it other than addiction because I think most people associate addiction [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4739.900000000001s)]
*  Most people would say like yeah, it's not a choice [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4745.3s)]
*  But you guys are choosing it a little bit and there's I don't know it's a I really do respect everyone's thoughts on that because it's a [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4747.74s)]
*  Tricky fucking thing but with the opioid compulsion to take the opioid or the dependence the opioid dependence [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4755.74s)]
*  I guess that that does feel like something else sometimes [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4762.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like they made a cheat code for your DNA. Yeah, it'd be like if you [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4766.0199999999995s)]
*  you know if you like [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4772.26s)]
*  Handed someone someone who doesn't like cocaine you handed them a flower every day with cocaine and they smelled it eventually [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4774.1s)]
*  want more cocaine your yeah, it feels like you're getting into the wiring of people who [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4779.580000000001s)]
*  Were just looking for pain management, right right and we're not looking to feel [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4786.14s)]
*  You know some sort of [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4792.02s)]
*  Psychological physical we're not we're not trying to feel some drugged out feeling right [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4794.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we're not trying to change their state of consciousness [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4800.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like they just cheat they took into a new lab and like we're gonna find some way to trump the system [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4802.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean drugs are already overriding [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4808.78s)]
*  Your desire to survive in a lot of cases and opioids it seems like ten times more so yeah [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4812.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's one thing. It's just unbelievable to me [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4818.78s)]
*  It's like and how our country lets that kind of happen like how our drug administration like that. Did you see dope sick? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4821.139999999999s)]
*  I did yeah, it was excellent. It broke my heart. Yeah [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4827.94s)]
*  you know it just like [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4832.259999999999s)]
*  You think there's a I think it used to feel like when Reagan was in right back when Reagan [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4834.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that there was never never did a thing wrong, right? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4841.0199999999995s)]
*  But are just whoever used to feel like at a time in in in life, right? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4844.0199999999995s)]
*  And this could be me romanticizing life that there was a time when [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4848.139999999999s)]
*  Your government or some overall governing bodies like [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4854.02s)]
*  they looked out for the [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4858.62s)]
*  Humans for the people in the country, right? Maybe maybe that's a just a crazy view [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4861.1s)]
*  But it used to no no, I don't mean I didn't make a face feel like crazy [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4866.58s)]
*  But yeah, I guess and maybe that was just me being a kid and the yeah, yeah, they could have you know [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4870.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a but then age now it seems like [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4875.54s)]
*  You do not can't you cannot count on your country to look out for you or your the administrations within your country [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4880.22s)]
*  I'd say that that's what I got out of dope sick kind of it was like they trumped the [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4889.02s)]
*  Because they hired people from the Food and Drug Administration and then work on their own [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4893.46s)]
*  board and they kind of like [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4898.38s)]
*  They made it so they would keep getting these pills like past like able to be you yeah [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4902.58s)]
*  Well, it's the basic problem that with [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4907.78s)]
*  With harmful habits, I know that sounds like a corny way to say it but with things we [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4913.18s)]
*  Do to ourselves where we have a morality play about it, you know, like oh [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4919.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they took they took opioids for post surgery and then they couldn't and then they they couldn't stop [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4925.58s)]
*  And they started lying to their doctor and it all it very quickly becomes [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4932.78s)]
*  Something got set in motion, but you the user of the chemical your kind of the problem [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4938.5s)]
*  Hmm, you know your you don't have strong willpower [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4945.099999999999s)]
*  You would rather be high on an opioid. I mean and and there's [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4948.86s)]
*  again like [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4954.66s)]
*  It's a strange thing. Here's how I sort of feel like is our drug addicts making a choice when they use drugs [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4956.7s)]
*  This is a crisis we set in motion, but I don't think we're in control of it [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4962.36s)]
*  At all at a point. I mean this is because it's a crisis whose timing you can't control like the the immediacy of drug addiction [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4967.62s)]
*  You can't predict you have no power over once it starts, right? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4975.5s)]
*  now it's it's that we see it as a story of a [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4980.78s)]
*  Bad thing you did, you know like I [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4987.099999999999s)]
*  Think some people look at Tiger Woods and they go his pill use is kind of because he had a tragic [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4990.58s)]
*  Character flaw earlier in his life as opposed to maybe the guy that has to perform at that level physically [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=4996.5s)]
*  Might develop a dependence on pills. Hmm. I do think people like to read into [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5003.34s)]
*  The dependence on drugs some sort of like deeper moral problem you have. Hmm [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5009.259999999999s)]
*  And it might be because when you are on drugs you make seriously immoral decisions sometimes. Hmm, so I don't know [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5015.9s)]
*  So I don't think the country's [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5022.98s)]
*  Ever looked out for I think a lot of I mean, I don't judge people for having a harsh view of [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5025.219999999999s)]
*  Attacks a lot of people have addicts in their lives and you can't just go it's a disease and I you know that good it can really [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5032.98s)]
*  It's very painful to other people yeah. Oh [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5041.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's a mess. They're a mess. Yeah life's so hard already life's like [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5045.339999999999s)]
*  Life's like a table piled high with so much shit like a bad [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5052.76s)]
*  You know when you go to like a little restaurant in the tiny circular ass table and they don't have room for anything [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5056.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah table piled high with shit and drugs come in and drugs [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5061.72s)]
*  You think you're gonna solve all your problems and they kick the legs out from under it. Yeah, they're just a mess [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5065.56s)]
*  It's it's they're a disaster. Yeah, they're a disaster [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5071.320000000001s)]
*  Do you what do you think I know people use them and they don't feel it no and some people are just for myself [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5076.84s)]
*  Right a disaster. Oh, yeah, I remember I got back from that trip of doing the taxi driver ended up dropping me off [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5084.2s)]
*  He oh, yeah after you did opium Jim. Yeah, right. So then I had to go to the hotel go to the airport after oh [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5092.28s)]
*  I ended up I get to the only way to the airport. I'm still texting the taxi driver [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5099.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, seeing if he can get us some coke like I'm leaving [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5105.2s)]
*  There's no oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm texting the guy [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5108.280000000001s)]
*  I've been up all night with and then when I get home I had left some cocaine on my counter [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5111.46s)]
*  I finally get off the plane is a miserable flight. You're just kind of rattling the whole way. Yeah, you get there [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5115.92s)]
*  I walk in my apartment. There was still some cocaine on the counter and I did it of course and I was like I gotta get some help [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5121.52s)]
*  Okay, I would never [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5129.88s)]
*  For one it was my part of my career I'd worked so hard for and then I'm having good opportunities like opium Jim was a [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5133.04s)]
*  amazing opportunity to be on there and [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5138.88s)]
*  I was letting drug like drugs were they I was just like and if you'd asked me the day before would you ever go to? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5141.64s)]
*  Opium Jim high on cocaine. I'd be like you are out of your mind [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5146.76s)]
*  Yeah, and so there I was, you know, so it's like wow. I have no control over this [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5150.64s)]
*  And then it becomes who the hell scheduled opium Jim when I'm in the middle of my cocaine [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5156.76s)]
*  People nuts [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5162.04s)]
*  You want me to go to Midtown Manhattan to the serious satellite radio building and record this [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5163.32s)]
*  When you were growing up, were you a hard kid for your parents to kind of deal with or do you think that they know? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5168.72s)]
*  I tried to keep my personal life very separate from my family. I [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5173.04s)]
*  Really? I like I knew really I didn't want to bring trouble home because that's everyone [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5176.8s)]
*  I I looked at people who would get in trouble a lot and it's like they'd leave their cigarettes out. They'd you know [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5183.5199999999995s)]
*  They [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5190.72s)]
*  They get they tag up their own garage like whatever right, right. I was just like leave that shit outside [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5192.32s)]
*  So you were good at hiding things. I was like I [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5198.92s)]
*  Was like a Michael Clayton of [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5204.4s)]
*  Bad kids. I was like I kind of I was like a fixer. I was like, alright, here's what we're gonna do [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5206.96s)]
*  He's the fixer. Yeah, have you seen that movie with George Clooney? He's a lawyer who kind of like I mean [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5212.88s)]
*  I guess he doesn't fix the major problems in the movie. So [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5219.16s)]
*  But he's a fix. Yeah, just as a like, you know, we're gonna get there. It is the truth can be adjusted [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5222.12s)]

*  filing lawsuits down at the fairground because you go to the fairgrounds like a day early down there and for [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5437.44s)]
*  50 cents you could ride any ride [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5442.08s)]
*  Why were people filing lawsuits because they go do that and then they try to you know [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5443.599999999999s)]
*  They ever you know half the people that show up or like laying outside of the road. Oh, I gotcha. Okay hurt [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5447.339999999999s)]

*  We're not even [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5463.5s)]
*  You know, it's just like what that could be very confusing to it. Yeah, I was like, well, I don't even know. Yeah [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5465.14s)]
*  What's happening? You know, it was just a scary place, right? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5471.46s)]
*  And so I remember at night I would like I wet the bed every night [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5474.88s)]
*  sure, I'd wet the bed two or three times a night and so [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5479.9s)]
*  I'd get up some nights and have to clean the sheets and lay them back down and then if I did a third time [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5483.42s)]
*  I wouldn't even have any sheets. What a lonely activity that is. Oh little kid in the middle and I just when you're washing your own sheets [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5488.98s)]
*  Just waiting by the dryer. I mean, yeah [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5495.98s)]
*  Up all night. No one's maybe your parents know but just smoking invisible cigarettes even yeah, just like [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5499.38s)]
*  Okay, I'll switch them [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5507.0199999999995s)]
*  What a lonely what a lonely little errand kids have to do dude that probably was one of the loneliest moments of my probably [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5509.02s)]
*  I would say in my childhood not and not try to get into self-pity, but it's like that was something it would be like man [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5515.540000000001s)]
*  I hate [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5521.860000000001s)]
*  That I do this because I'm scared. I feel like something's wrong with me and then I always have to do this by myself [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5523.46s)]
*  You know, oh, yeah [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5530.580000000001s)]
*  it would take you know, it would take a good 20 minutes if you clean your bed up and then put on some other sheets and then [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5531.9400000000005s)]
*  You know [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5537.34s)]
*  Even if you didn't have to go wash them, you know [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5540.34s)]
*  If you had to wash them the next day or something [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5541.900000000001s)]
*  But just to make it all clean, you know get out the car sure the cleanser and clean that clean this stuff [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5543.18s)]
*  But I remember I would look in my closet [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5547.780000000001s)]
*  I would tie Kate tie a string from one doorknob to the other [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5549.820000000001s)]
*  Like I would make I'd have to look outside of the windows and look in every corner just making sure why would you tie one? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5553.62s)]
*  String from one door knob to the other and then I put a couple of jay bales on a couple jingle bells on it [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5559.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, and then you would hear them if somebody went one way or the other if someone was coming into your room [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5564.74s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So there was just like a ton of like a lot of fear [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5568.74s)]
*  I had a ton of fear when I was a kid. Yeah, and then I guess when you're in fear you kind of like [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5572.139999999999s)]
*  Fear is kind of a lonely place to be oh, it's very lonely. Yeah, so you're always kind of I see you're you're the one who's looking out [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5580.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so I think maybe a lot of that kind of shaped how I was when I was young, you know [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5587.42s)]
*  It's probably what hell is [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5592.72s)]
*  Being very very afraid. That's a good interesting call [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5595.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5599.2s)]
*  There's nothing worse than being really afraid really ashamed and afraid is rough [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5600.32s)]
*  Oh a shame too if you put that in there like well if you add to it like I'm in this disaster [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5604.48s)]
*  And I'm to blame for it. Yeah [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5608.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5611.84s)]
*  Did you have any issues as you got more popular with your own ego? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5613.16s)]
*  probably but [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5617.96s)]
*  But because I've noticed those in my own life, you know, it's not a judgment I'm just curious [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5623.0s)]
*  No, no, no, and I'm not I'm not trying when I say but I'm not trying to dial it back [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5627.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5632.92s)]
*  Egos kind of a scary thing right because you don't know where it is. Yeah, I don't know where it is [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5635.2s)]
*  And you don't know what doses are healthy. You know how some people have like good boundaries [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5639.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and they're like no I don't allow this and you go like that sounds like sometimes there's a side of me that thinks that [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5643.3s)]
*  boundaries sound stuck up [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5650.0s)]
*  Like that doesn't work for me. I don't allow a hundred people to crash on my floor out of nowhere, you know [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5652.28s)]
*  and I'm like, but though [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5657.8s)]
*  like I [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5659.84s)]
*  always [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5661.5599999999995s)]
*  That didn't really make sense my example [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5662.8s)]
*  no, like I [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5665.5599999999995s)]
*  Let me think about that. I feel like I'm rambling right now. It's my ego [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5668.4s)]
*  for sure like [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5674.04s)]
*  Did you feel like once you achieved like some level of success? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5676.32s)]
*  Like do you think success was your driving force? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5679.2s)]
*  like what do you think kind of with some of your driving force to do stand up and to [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5681.84s)]
*  To entertain like where do you think that kind of comes from for you? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5686.36s)]
*  Is it a necessity is it a desire to be seen as a creative? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5689.84s)]
*  Is it? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5694.28s)]
*  What do you think? Do you have any thoughts on it? I have many I'm trying to [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5696.16s)]
*  me trying to think of a [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5700.8s)]
*  semi-interesting answer [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5703.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to I wanted people to say that guy's the best at what he does [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5705.2s)]
*  Wow [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5711.599999999999s)]
*  Me even if it's ten people, right? I wanted I wanted [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5712.88s)]
*  Some people to go that he's the best at what he did. My dad's a very successful guy and very [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5717.5599999999995s)]
*  Very smart very [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5725.0s)]
*  He just he he had stature to me. He still does I mean, but he has stature. It just [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5728.28s)]
*  People would tell me growing up your dad's the smartest person I've ever met your dad's the best attorney I've ever seen like wow he just I [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5734.84s)]
*  Wanted stature from a young age, I think [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5742.4800000000005s)]
*  That makes sense now, which is a strange thing because what does that mean? That means you've already accomplished things [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5745.96s)]
*  past tense or [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5751.4800000000005s)]
*  And also it's not great for a comedian, you know, you know [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5754.0s)]
*  I don't like when I don't want to be a comedian where it's like everyone respects me, but I'm not funny anymore. Yeah [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5757.28s)]
*  I don't think you could ever be that that's nice of you to say but we all we're all running from that [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5763.96s)]
*  Oh, that's a good next bet. Yeah. Well, it's interesting you say about stature because you almost have this [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5768.54s)]
*  Thing sometimes and I don't know if maybe I'm trying to see into this a little where it's like [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5775.64s)]
*  Can't you like you almost operate in a way that and you said it yourself like I've I've done this [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5780.16s)]
*  Like it's already completed like a little bit guys. I'm already the number one entertainment in America [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5787.4s)]
*  Can we just sit back and please enjoy it? Right? Yeah, even though we even though you couldn't even enjoy the moments [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=5792.68s)]

*  the things I deserved as a child from my [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6090.36s)]
*  Environment from my parents and I think there's a part of me that like I mean I can feel it when I even say that [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6095.4800000000005s)]

*  Being able to have had some of these things [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6113.16s)]
*  There was a feeling [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6117.6s)]
*  You needed to have as a kid that you didn't have yeah, and you don't want to close the door on that until you [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6119.200000000001s)]
*  Can give yourself that yeah, and I think it makes it real [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6125.64s)]
*  It almost makes me hate growing up mm-hmm because [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6129.76s)]

*  But man I it [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6156.84s)]
*  Hurts me yeah, you know and some people say it's like you got to get over those things [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6159.32s)]
*  And you have to go through your step work, and you have to let go resentments and and I believe that right [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6164.08s)]
*  but [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6170.24s)]

*  Letting go [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6181.2s)]
*  You know and growing up [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6182.68s)]

*  That's okay. I can't I [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6192.4800000000005s)]

*  So I think I was always scared. He was gonna die you know sure and [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6223.76s)]
*  So it made it just I don't know the recipe was really weird man [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6228.04s)]
*  So anyway, I talk about that stuff a lot [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6232.6s)]
*  I'm not trying to harp on it, but there's sometimes you just have to wait for yourself to get there [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6234.64s)]
*  You know you can do a lot of the work on the outside [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6239.44s)]
*  But sometimes it's like that inner child or whatever they say like that motherfucker can be a little slow. You know [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6242.5199999999995s)]

*  kind of [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6387.2s)]
*  It isn't kind of it is about everything from intervention through rehab and after [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6388.5599999999995s)]
*  so at the moment or in the past two years I [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6395.32s)]
*  Haven't wondered what I'm gonna talk about on stage [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6400.76s)]
*  But now having shot this thing and you know and [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6404.16s)]
*  I'm really really happy with it, and it's longer than my other specials and it [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6409.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm thrilled that it's longer. It's kind of this was the time to do this chunk of material [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6416.2s)]
*  This was the moment in my life to do this with that gone now. I start to wonder hmm. Yeah [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6420.92s)]
*  Now I'm now. I don't remember how to do comedy and oh, that's a great statement. Oh, yeah, I don't last night [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6426.76s)]
*  I was like I don't have jokes. I don't [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6433.48s)]
*  Maybe I'll try this old one that it was part of the hour that I cut [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6436.36s)]
*  But I just I don't what is going on here. How do I do this? I don't know what I'm doing Wow [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6440.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary. It's really scary letting something go putting out something. That's new putting out something. That's more like [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6447.639999999999s)]
*  Obviously we tell stories that are based on our real lives or I have moments some of them [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6455.0s)]
*  But to put out something that's like really this is like me just tracking part of my life [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6459.240000000001s)]
*  And it was a little bit like I can't I can't do I can't talk about other things until I get this out [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6464.0s)]
*  I don't mean like people were waiting for it. I just mean I don't this I [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6471.2s)]
*  this has to be what the next special is and [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6476.84s)]
*  It was rather easy because there were lots of stories from it [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6481.240000000001s)]
*  It wasn't easy to get it where it was but you know, it took two years of touring but it it felt like [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6484.12s)]
*  Okay, inevitably [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6492.84s)]
*  There's you know over an hour of nonsense that happened. Yeah [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6495.32s)]
*  so [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6500.28s)]
*  Do you is it interesting like because some people I think as we get older they want us [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6501.4s)]
*  To be older in a way or they want we have to evolve or something right because for sure [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6507.24s)]
*  You know, we can't have the same thoughts and stuff that we had when we were 10 years ago or 15 years ago when we were starting [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6513.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I don't know. Is that is anyone saying that no one is I mean that might that's a good [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6521.36s)]
*  I mean wanting to evolve is a good thing. It's scary though. I think we're always arguing with some straw man. That's not really [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6527.2s)]
*  There of what like what we should be talking. I mean, I don't think that's a good point. I was just doing that [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6534.24s)]
*  Yeah, and now it's trying to bring you into it. No, I did that last night. Yeah, right. I was like [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6538.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, maybe I should be like [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6544.4s)]
*  Maybe I should have a lot of political jokes. I thought this standing back. I was about to go on [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6546.4s)]
*  Well, you're respected enough man, and it's such an interest. You're so yourself that if you just get up on stage [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6550.2s)]
*  I am curious as to what is job thinking about [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6556.719999999999s)]
*  No way that's nice you to say but like I went and saw Stavi at the Pittsburgh improv [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6560.88s)]
*  Stavros Halkias. Yeah. Yeah. And that I was like god [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6567.12s)]
*  I was like, that's a person who's just funny right away. That's a person who's funny where I'm like [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6570.28s)]
*  I'm willing like I'm just gonna watch him talk to the crowd. I'm gonna watch any I would kill to have that Wow [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6576.28s)]
*  That's it I well I guess everybody wants a little bit of something else, you know, or would love to have moments of the other person [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6583.24s)]
*  You know, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's like obvious. Wow. He says see a lot too. And I don't say it that much [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6589.679999999999s)]
*  He does. Yeah. Yeah, he does. He likes a I feel like he's almost does it deliberately you think I think he I think he knows exactly [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6596.5199999999995s)]
*  What he's doing. Yeah, you might be right. I think he's doing it. I think he's doing it. I think he's doing it [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6604.24s)]
*  You think I think he I think he knows exactly what he's doing. Yeah, you might for right away or Brody like yeah [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6608.84s)]
*  Like that Brody very interesting Brody was he's almost a reverse psychology. I didn't know he was doing half the time up there. I mean [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6616.28s)]
*  Brody like I [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6625.0s)]
*  always I mean [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6627.68s)]
*  the amount of times I went why can't I [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6629.4400000000005s)]
*  Here I am. It's my own show. I'm in a theater [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6632.64s)]
*  I'm at an arena like if I could bring the same excitement that Brody brought to warming up a [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6635.76s)]
*  Chelsea handler audience I'd be I'd have it made why can't I have that thing, you know [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6643.56s)]
*  but do you did someone at some point your life or did some straw man tell you that you don't because [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6650.52s)]
*  Like when I watch your special last night, I was watching the [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6655.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean some [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6659.5199999999995s)]
*  Radio City music. Some voices over you're boring and no one wants to hear this and you're not fun and you're not [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6661.12s)]
*  You're actually not you're not good at performing your own material. That's something dude when I watched that I was like man [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6667.12s)]
*  And I'd seen it before but I was like [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6675.72s)]
*  I'm just so involved even when you go to get the sip of water and drink it out of the cup [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6678.32s)]
*  And you probably think man. It's a last-minute decision. No stool. The water's got to go [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6682.599999999999s)]
*  Stool the water's got to go somewhere. Yeah, it was really interesting. I was like that he put it there [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6687.64s)]
*  That's what he's doing. But you probably hit it behind a light bulb where you're going to get it. Yeah [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6691.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was like bored right now [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6695.68s)]
*  No in that moment [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6697.84s)]
*  I was like can I pick up a glass of water without dropping it in front of six thousand people? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6699.320000000001s)]
*  Because I was like I've never had it on the floor before so [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6703.6s)]
*  No, I mean listen. I also I I don't mean to sound like oh, I feel like shit about my what we always like what I do [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6707.280000000001s)]
*  We always just want to be something. Yeah. Oh, it's funny. I think there's no doubt [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6713.320000000001s)]
*  There's probably there's probably 20 guys when I watch on like oh man. I wish I had some of that. Oh my god [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6716.96s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be really cool. Absolutely. And you know what? I don't think there's anything wrong with I think it's a totally healthy thing [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6722.6s)]
*  I think we've been talking a lot about also. Yeah things in us that we feel are missing, but [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6727.4800000000005s)]
*  It's quite it's a good thing to watch Stavros and be envious. Yeah, like that's that's something that gets me [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6733.0s)]
*  comedians who write jokes that I'm just like, you know [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6742.16s)]
*  When I hear a joke why just saw Nate's special I was like god I wish I had those [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6745.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's exciting. I know there's nothing to me unhealthy about that. Yeah, that's true [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6749.46s)]
*  It's nice I think and it's really just an admiration to that person [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6754.3s)]
*  But I think that there's so many people that for sure that look at you and think that way like I wish I could be as put [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6758.38s)]
*  Together as that guy, you know, that's and use the word haberdasher. I saw in one of them. That was great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6764.1s)]
*  Harry Truman ran a haberdashery that went bust. Did he? That's the first time I think I heard that word [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6772.26s)]
*  yeah, a little kid hearing about Harry Truman some guy opened one up I think bus when we were growing up and [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6778.2s)]
*  People thought it was like a hashed in or whatever and they shut it down. I remember. Oh, wow. Yeah [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6783.5s)]
*  but [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6788.7s)]
*  In this violent place you were growing up someone tried to open a haberdashery [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6790.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, very nice. They had a lot of narcs bus a lot of people were always doing narkin, you know [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6794.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, where they get some kid fuck, you know, there's a thing called snap. It was it called snaps [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6799.86s)]
*  It was this weird program in Chicago where? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6805.86s)]
*  Chicago PD would send [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6808.74s)]
*  Like two 13 year olds up to a bar to try to get in and then they'd bust the bar I [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6811.54s)]
*  Knew I knew this one kid whose dad was a detective and they so they sent him and he went up and he went [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6817.5s)]
*  Don't let me in I'm here with snub. I [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6823.42s)]
*  Mean if that was true I [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6827.5s)]
*  In retrospect, I can't imagine that would be like an actual CPD program [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6831.66s)]
*  But I like that he I like that he didn't want the bar to get busted. Yeah [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6837.58s)]
*  Then he could probably come back the next weekend and be like I did you a solid [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6841.9s)]
*  Yeah, let me in. Yeah over to then he like it's carted out of the [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6845.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6849.7s)]
*  What was your like you remember like your first relationship growing up? What was that? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6851.179999999999s)]
*  What do you mean like dating and stuff was that tough for you as a kid or were you pretty good at it? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6855.0199999999995s)]
*  No, I wasn't good at it. I didn't realize you weren't supposed to tell girls how much you liked them [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6859.46s)]
*  because in movies that's what the [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6866.7s)]
*  that's what the hero would do is he'd be like I [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6869.0199999999995s)]
*  Love you so much and they'd be like, oh my god, no other guy at school talks this way, right? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6872.219999999999s)]
*  So I thought okay, you got to be like that [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6877.0599999999995s)]
*  you got to be like these John Cusack types who tell you how they're feeling and [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6879.38s)]
*  No one really likes that. Yeah [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6883.5s)]
*  Yes, too alarming for people the reality of is too armed for people but that was also like again like [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6886.139999999999s)]
*  romanticizing [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6892.46s)]
*  Romance. I was just like no one had I brought a heaviness to that that I think people were like this is you got to relax [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6894.0599999999995s)]
*  This is you know making out in winter coats here. Yeah. Yeah, this is not anything that serious [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6901.679999999999s)]

*  mine this girl, um [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6960.96s)]
*  This girl was like kind of doing BJ's at school and she liked me right and I didn't it was like she was really funny [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6963.92s)]
*  That's what I liked about her, but she was also doing BJ's right and people were and nobody was doing them sure and so [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6970.44s)]
*  It was kind of nervous because I liked her. Mm-hmm, right? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6979.92s)]

*  But I also was embarrassed in a way because I didn't [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6991.96s)]
*  want people like people were like kind of like [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=6995.92s)]

*  I thought your motives would you thought your motives for hanging out with her would be suspect, right? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7004.72s)]
*  And I thought that they would judge me somehow. I've always [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7010.32s)]
*  I've always been like [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7016.56s)]
*  I've always taken on the responsibility or taking on the paint or the judgment that other people put on somebody that I have attached [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7021.88s)]
*  to me in a weird way. Oh [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7028.400000000001s)]
*  You mean you get I get offended or I get like embarrassed. Oh, wow [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7030.76s)]

*  I think I do that too. I it's really not fair [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7042.4800000000005s)]
*  I had a girlfriend that used to she wouldn't know where people were like we're standing around somewhere [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7044.92s)]
*  She had bad peripheral vision and yeah the worst dude it was [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7049.12s)]
*  Unbelievable, so she would always we'd be talking beautiful girl [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7054.24s)]
*  I loved her but she'd always like walk right back when somebody was walking [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7057.8s)]
*  I'm just like and it ruined it for me. Oh wow you felt her embarrassment. Yeah, was she herself embarrassed not that much [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7060.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh interesting. So she you weren't even feeling her embarrassment. You were just feeling the only embarrassment [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7068.12s)]
*  Yeah, it was almost like the universe had to give it to someone and she was unaware [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7073.12s)]
*  Yeah, but I would take it on though and I would always be like I'm not gonna let you be a reflection of how people see me [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7077.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm, no matter who that was and I think that probably goes back to my childhood [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7085.16s)]
*  I was very embarrassed in my situation that I was in something about it made me uncomfortable [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7089.64s)]
*  So that's how I behave still it's unfair. It's not fair to other people, you know, but then you also [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7094.400000000001s)]

*  And I remember just being so nervous, dude [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7155.72s)]
*  Yeah, I could barely even walk over there and I get by the tree and then [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7158.36s)]
*  We like barely even said any words, you know, and then [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7163.08s)]
*  She might have felt a responsibility to do it now because we planned it, you know, I don't even know [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7167.2s)]
*  Well, you'd exchange many letters over it. Yeah [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7171.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then she starts doing it and then the girl's mom whose party house it was like we're behind a tree [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7174.4s)]
*  So the only thing you can't see is the actual kind of BJ and you can see me and her [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7181.48s)]
*  BJ and you can see me and her okay, and then the girl's mom came out and [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7186.12s)]

*  It made me oh I [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7196.96s)]
*  Just felt so much embarrassment. I think for yourself. I [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7199.4s)]
*  Think for both of us, you know, mm-hmm. But what yeah what she's doing is embarrassing me, but then I'm also here receive [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7203.68s)]

*  So anyway, that was I think you know, I had some early uncomfort with that [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7216.12s)]
*  And just the fact that I loved I felt like I kind of loved this girl [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7221.84s)]
*  Yeah, and other people thought that there was something wrong with her [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7226.8s)]

*  I think it did something to me a little bit but changed your perception of her [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7234.12s)]
*  Yeah, and it just made it changed how it made me often like really conscious of what people thought of who? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7238.92s)]

*  Yeah, that would have been probably the route that would have been just [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7696.28s)]
*  To better service the hour, you know, yeah, I get that [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7700.08s)]

*  Material that's on the special you have to kind of turn over, you know [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7768.52s)]

*  Like did you make like a comedy album? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7796.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, unrelated to a not a TV. Yeah. Yeah, I did that too [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7799.04s)]
*  And I thought when that came out I kind of thought I was gonna do a comedy show [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7802.88s)]
*  I did that too and I thought when that came out I can never do any of these jokes again [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7805.68s)]
*  Wow, no one fucking listened to it. Yeah, I wish I was I remember going out to do [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7809.200000000001s)]
*  Was I just starting to headline? Maybe I think I was gonna headline the Houston laugh stop [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7814.84s)]
*  And I had a CD that was out and I was like well if anyone's heard the CD they'd know that know these jokes [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7821.200000000001s)]
*  So I got to do a whole new hour. Oh, no, you didn't know absolutely no one had heard this album [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7826.88s)]
*  No, and some guys you can just do that's one thing about putting things out [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7833.12s)]
*  It's like if you never put things out then you would just be this thing that people can only go see if they go see you [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7837.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think about that. I think about like the Grateful Dead model, too [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7841.92s)]
*  Yeah, I was like I wish I could make every show different and tour like that [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7845.320000000001s)]
*  You probably ever I guess so. Well, I think a lot of what you need to do is you need to get like three hours [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7850.4400000000005s)]
*  of stuff and then you just [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7856.740000000001s)]
*  Sample between it which some people do I guess do you think people come to see you or your material? Oh, I don't know [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7858.98s)]
*  um, I think the material because if you don't have it in [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7865.78s)]
*  Like if I don't have it in the first ten minutes in the first five minutes, it's not that fun [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7873.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's true for anybody, huh? I don't know. I mean in an arena. I don't know [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7878.58s)]
*  maybe they're coming just for the maybe some people come for the like [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7882.099999999999s)]
*  This is cool of it, you know, yeah, especially though. No, what am I saying? I think it's all for the jokes [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7886.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah people want to be entertained for sure [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7892.9400000000005s)]
*  I think at a certain point though people kind of get to know you especially probably after this special comes out [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7895.58s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna get to know maybe more about some of your journey. There's a lot in it. You get to know me pretty well [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7900.78s)]
*  So that I mean I think of letting people get to know you [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7907.3s)]
*  You know, it's important and then they know you you know, they get to know you [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7911.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's all fun them getting to know one side of you and then and then you go. Okay. Also, sometimes I'm not a great guy [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7915.780000000001s)]

*  More you can do more nights at a theater more people will come see you [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UCTacjaNco&t=7947.74s)]
