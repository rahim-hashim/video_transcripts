*  Not a whole lot of brothers in the country music space, you know, but I think you've done well with it [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1049.76s)]
*  Similar question to you Theo. I know you kind of talk about it all the time. But what's like being [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1056.12s)]
*  you know a southern brother a southern man southern gentleman and [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1061.08s)]
*  Hollywood, you know similar plight [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1067.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of stereotypes on both accounts. Let me know what you guys think gang gang buzz buzz gang, bro [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1070.2s)]
*  Well, I'll answer first that okay, yeah, yeah, I don't feel I don't feel I just feel like Hollywood kind of forgot [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1076.66s)]
*  I feel like sometimes this is just my perception also. I don't know if this is anybody else's I just feel like sometimes [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1083.66s)]
*  Hollywood forgets that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1091.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of talent [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1093.7s)]
*  That everybody from the south isn't like a racist person or isn't a bad person or isn't narrow-minded or isn't dumb or isn't or can't be [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1097.66s)]
*  Creative I think that they you know when I was growing up they just had shows that there was a little bit more [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1104.92s)]
*  I feel like diversity of [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1109.64s)]
*  Of where people were from, you know, and then I think they started to get [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1112.96s)]
*  It just started to get a little bit narrow [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1119.48s)]
*  But I think that that also provides a lot of opportunities for people to start their own platforms and also for cities like Nashville [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1123.16s)]
*  Who still who have like a real confluence of I feel like kind of everywhere? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1130.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a good southern vibe here, but there's a lot of people from all over here. So for I feel like [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1133.96s)]
*  you know, um [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1140.56s)]
*  For me, I feel like I did feel like a lot of everybody thought I was just a redneck [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1142.76s)]
*  You know, nobody gave me a chance to kind of get to know me. I feel like in comedy [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1147.04s)]
*  But I think it also kept a chip on my shoulder that made me want to keep trying harder [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1152.08s)]
*  And also made me have to be creative and made me have to kind of prove myself a little bit [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1158.2s)]
*  Maybe if I'm real honest, you know, and if I'm [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1162.62s)]
*  You know and some of that could have been on my own head too [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1166.86s)]
*  Like I think they hate me that kind of shit that Eminem type of shit, you know [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1169.3799999999999s)]

*  Going, you know, yeah [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1183.4599999999998s)]
*  But I but I don't I don't know if I feel I'm just as a country music listener [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1186.3s)]

*  But my fans is what accepted me and they pushed me to where I'm at now [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1212.7s)]

*  And then like I remember and it's it sucked at the moment but now just looking back I was like was awesome [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1630.3600000000001s)]

*  My name is Clay. I'm a singer songwriter here in Nashville and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1816.5s)]
*  Kane I got a question for you [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1820.06s)]
*  If you could name three other bands or artists to go on a dream tour with who would they be and? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1821.3799999999999s)]

*  it's that's one of the things we always talked about is like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1840.98s)]
*  You know me and me and our Dean want to go in, you know together and tour again [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1844.3s)]
*  I was like deep voice tour, bro. People get stuck in the mud just in y'all's voices, bro [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1848.6999999999998s)]

*  But now it's like he's got you know [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  Triple my number ones [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1861.18s)]
*  But if we play like a 12,000 seat venue, it's like we can both sell that out right? So it's how do you do it? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1863.78s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? I mean, obviously, I mean I look at it as our Dean would have to be the headliner [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1870.3s)]
*  It'd be a wild tour [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1877.5s)]
*  Yeah, and some of it gets is it hard with ego does ego come in [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1879.3s)]
*  It doesn't sound like it when you're talking about that because you guys it sounds like you're willing to kind of figure it out [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1882.66s)]
*  Agents kind of get into it sometimes, you know thing. Yeah. Yeah, I don't have a big ego [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1887.46s)]

*  But I don't know. I mean like I feel like if I went out with Jason we would have to end up doing [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1896.8600000000001s)]
*  Stadiums. Yeah, and then we would have to get another big artists as well [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1901.9s)]

*  He just keeps evolving [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1960.02s)]
*  He's like little Wayne like by the end like little Wayne looks like a Christmas tree now [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1961.32s)]
*  He look at him like he got so much swag on him, you know, so he's awesome, too, man [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1964.68s)]
*  But Khalid dude, he's just got he's just so chill and laid-back. I remember we were doing that music video be like that and [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1968.96s)]

*  Whenever he's his moves that he's doing he did this one thing [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1982.76s)]
*  I was so jealous of because he says don't cry in the song. Mm-hmm, and he was just vibing. He just did this [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1985.68s)]
*  Oh, and I was like, how did you make that look so cool, bro? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1990.6399999999999s)]

*  I'm just like, yeah [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=1999.32s)]
*  Yeah, some people just have coolness in them, bro [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2002.28s)]
*  You know some people just have swagger. I think that's one thing going back to Connor McGregor. There's just something about it [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2006.08s)]
*  You know, you got that walk. He's got that man. Yeah, he's got the walk and he just it's like a confidence at another level [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2011.8s)]
*  You know, yeah, I always felt that way growing up around even mostly like black eyes like our neighborhood was black and white [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2017.8799999999999s)]
*  but the black guys always I [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2022.8s)]
*  Level of comfort with what they did like I always felt like my like if I'm making a move [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2025.36s)]
*  I'm thinking about it first, you know [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2031.3999999999999s)]
*  But the black guys always just seemed like just it was like they were just like living in a river [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2033.04s)]
*  You know, it just seemed like and I'm out here. I'm fucking just kind of hanging on the bank [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2038.28s)]
*  You know, yeah, I think I was always envious of like I think it's one of the reasons why a lot of people get in [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2042.04s)]
*  Me so black culture is this you know, a lot of black guys seems so confident, you know [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2046.44s)]
*  But I saw that video I saw that video actually, and I thought it was awesome [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2050.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely a little bit different. Oh, it's way different. So who's that third man? You got to finish this off, baby [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2054.2s)]
*  Who's that third? So at least you said already that Jason Aldean could go last very kind of you. Yeah, and [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2058.9199999999996s)]
*  And so yeah, who would be that third on there? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2066.56s)]
*  Man honestly, I [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  Would love to do I mean I would love to tour with anybody really but I feel like just with quarantine my my my three [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2075.24s)]
*  Included would be like me Jason and John party. Oh, yeah. Yeah, just because me and John's got really close [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2084.3199999999997s)]
*  He's like my neighbor is he really his wife's was to cut my hair actually really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2090.04s)]
*  Yes, I saw him at Kid Rocks birthday party. He might if you need another boy if you need a barber [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2095.02s)]
*  Just let me know dude. I don't know if I'm with that fade, but I hate no [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2099.64s)]
*  Don't get it. You don't have to get the fade but you can fade this right here. Yeah, I could do this better [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2102.6s)]
*  Yeah, fade this one. I'm not saying you do it better [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2106.56s)]
*  But I'm saying if you faded this and then left the rest of this. Yeah, maybe I'll do that man [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2108.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I would go for something man. I've been doing I've been seeing this little lady over here that cuts it and she's good [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2113.76s)]
*  But I'd probably venture out but yeah, John said his wife was there too. And she's really I [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2118.2400000000002s)]
*  Said you better be there when she cuts it John [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2123.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, cuz I don't want to get a cute John's actually waiting for my barber to come back in town [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2125.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, you got his haircut by him in Gatlin Berg [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2129.9s)]
*  Well, then that's strange because his wife cuts hair [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2132.88s)]

*  I'd be a good tour and it'd be fun. That would be fun, bro stated. Do you think like [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2160.82s)]
*  Like you're at a level man. You go to a ring [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2165.78s)]
*  I mean you can do yeah doing those level of ticket. It does get spookier once you get bigger. It's like [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2167.94s)]
*  You know, you got to package it up [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2173.94s)]
*  It has to make sense to the the agents when it's all make sense or otherwise you're taking a pay cut, you know [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2176.66s)]
*  Well see the agents just care about tickets [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2182.86s)]
*  So like the thing for the artists is especially when you've been doing it for years like at first [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2185.14s)]
*  I didn't care who I was out with I was excited [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2189.38s)]
*  Which I was out with FGL. So it was a good tour to be on for the first tour [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2192.02s)]
*  When you're an artist you also want you're also with these people all the time [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2195.9s)]
*  So you want it to be a good hang? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2199.78s)]
*  You don't want to be the people that just go on the bus and they don't talk to you or that's boring tour [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2201.26s)]
*  Yeah, so but for me, it's hard to [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2205.78s)]
*  Go out with somebody that I enjoy their company and hanging out with but also fits my lane of music as well, right? So [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2209.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, I got invited in a movie last year [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2218.42s)]
*  And [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2223.66s)]
*  I went there and no it just the hang was not goes gonna be 12 weeks [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2224.98s)]
*  so luckily I was able to get out of it, but uh [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2229.38s)]
*  Man, I was like dude. There's just no hang. It's just like going back to my hotel [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2233.18s)]
*  It just what I would have gotten is such like a like a like a downward space, you know [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2237.74s)]
*  Yeah, and comedian you just well, at least you get to bring like your opener or somebody like that, you know [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2242.22s)]
*  But I just do theaters, but I think I'm I [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2248.3399999999997s)]
*  Don't know if I'd ever want to do diff anything bigger [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2251.42s)]
*  I don't know if you know if God would ever even had me doing that, you know [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2254.5s)]
*  if I don't know if that's in my future, but I [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2257.86s)]
*  Like theaters because it's at least still for comedians. It's still kind of personal enough [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2260.3s)]
*  Because you're just talking, you know, yeah, whereas music I mean you get everybody rock and I don't know if it matters if [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2265.1s)]
*  They're in a small space or a big space. Does it feel different to you? Oh, yeah [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2270.26s)]
*  You know for a while I was excited to just you know be playing but once I put my foot in the arena [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2274.34s)]
*  it was like well cuz you hear like just this different type of roar with echo as well and [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2280.9s)]
*  Then that's crazy, bro. You also you only see people in the pit [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2287.02s)]
*  so it's kind of like you're still playing and you know, just a regular bar, but then [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2291.34s)]
*  After that first couple rows, it's black. Yeah, so it's like you can just have the time of your life on stage [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2297.7000000000003s)]
*  You ain't got to make eye contact with anybody [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2304.1s)]
*  You can just kind of be yourself and then when you just when you hear the roar it just amps you up even more [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2306.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's fun. Damn [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2311.3799999999997s)]
*  That's interesting take cuz I [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2314.18s)]
*  Never thought about it like that like I'll play like I think I maybe played [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2316.2599999999998s)]
*  2500 in Melbourne in Australia. I think that was maybe like the biggest amount that I did last time [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  But I could only see the front but I always think like shit. I'm scared cuz I I [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2326.8199999999997s)]
*  Don't know where I'm supposed to be looking for these people in the distance, you know [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2331.3399999999997s)]
*  Sometimes I won't even come out early. So I don't know how big the room is [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2334.42s)]
*  I'll be like yelling like it's a big room and then the lights will come on at the end [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2336.98s)]
*  It's like they just got him kind of packed in. I'm like damn. I just read the room wrong [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2340.38s)]
*  but maybe that's a better take to just [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2344.78s)]
*  Perform for the people in the front, you know, yeah, I mean if they're laughing everybody else will be laughing [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2347.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good person to laugh to make everybody else laugh. Yeah, that's a good point, bro [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2352.2200000000003s)]
*  I know yeah, I never thought I just I always feel like I'm just like kind of yelling into this abyss [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2356.34s)]
*  Maybe because I think I'm focusing on the abyss instead of focusing just on the people in the front. Yeah [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=2361.66s)]

*  And they're just they're just so different man. They have like these crazy harmonies. They can all sing. None of them sound alike [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3761.44s)]
*  And it's just something different to bring to country music [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3768.3199999999997s)]
*  I like that man. Well that goes back even to our first question, man [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3773.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just about being different and doing different things in the space man, you know [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3776.72s)]
*  and it's interesting when you come from a place that's even just a little bit different whether it's you part of your history or uh, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3780.48s)]

*  And so it's interesting to see that it's kind of transposing itself into um into you recognizing difference [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3794.8s)]
*  You know in what could be unique for for the genre, you know, yeah [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3800.48s)]

*  until later on and we all actually reconnected and he kind of told us like [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=3998.0s)]
*  You know, I was actually going to be a part of it and decided not to do it. I was like [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4002.16s)]
*  Well, he he worked out at the time at the time [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4006.0s)]

*  And I was just thinking about this, you know, we were just like, you know [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4019.36s)]
*  all in kane's truck the other day listening to this, uh, this new song we uh, we just put out and uh, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4022.4s)]
*  It was just really cool. I was just like I can't believe eight years later [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4027.6s)]
*  Like here we all are all together working on this music together and we all get to be a part of it [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4030.24s)]
*  It's really really cool [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4034.88s)]
*  And we keep saying, you know our catchphrase is how full circle this all is and it really is and it's really cool [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4035.92s)]
*  To get to work with kane. Amen, bro [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4041.84s)]
*  You know, it's interesting how if you yeah [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4044.48s)]
*  It's so hard to realize at the moment that that the that there's a bigger picture going on that you can't see [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4046.56s)]
*  It's so hard to realize that like so many things feel like defeats in our lives or it feels like man [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4052.8s)]
*  It's supposed to happen right now [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4058.56s)]
*  Yeah, and then it doesn't happen for eight years for 10 years for 12 years and that's when it's really supposed to happen [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4060.32s)]
*  It's just so hard to recognize that man. You just gotta follow your gut. Yeah [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4066.0s)]
*  Yeah, you just gotta follow. Yeah, but some of your gut is like greedy, bro [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4070.96s)]
*  My gut gets greedy, bro [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4074.48s)]
*  You know my gut wants that, you know, you want it now [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4076.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you want to be angry that it's not happening. But [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4078.24s)]
*  You know to see you guys, you know, really take this restless road. Honestly, I mean, you know not to freaking [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4081.68s)]
*  you know sound like as cliche as anybody ever could but [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4086.72s)]
*  um [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4090.08s)]
*  So what is it? Like what is you guys just sound different is like kind of like the beetles but stuck in the woods [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4091.04s)]
*  Like what is it? Like tell me what's going on [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4095.92s)]
*  I love that. We're just using that. You know what man? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4098.56s)]
*  I think one thing that's cool about our group is you know, we're really focused on harmonies [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4101.68s)]
*  but also we each like cain was saying have these different voices and uh, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4105.68s)]
*  We try to feature everyone's voice in in each song and uh, I don't I don't really think there's a lot of bands that [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4109.36s)]
*  That do that and showcase different vocalists and we each have a different style and we each have a different story and a background [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4114.8s)]
*  So it's really cool when all those things come together [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4120.72s)]
*  in the songs that we write [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4123.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, i'm trying to think if there's a lot of like, uh trueettes or something. What's a three three duet? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4125.36s)]
*  Is it a true trio a trio? Yeah, my man [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4130.0s)]
*  i'm trying to think of how a tree if they have a lot of [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4133.04s)]
*  I guess they've had like rascal flats dixie chicks. I'm trying to think but even with like the rascal flats [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4136.0s)]

*  You know ever since this band started that people have always told us [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4146.0s)]
*  Oh, you can't have more than one lead singer [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4148.5599999999995s)]
*  And uh, I mean we we've got told that for years and you know for a while we believed it and it really wasn't until we [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4150.64s)]
*  Started working with cain and we felt like we got this whole [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4156.56s)]
*  Clean slate this do-over and we were like we're gonna finally do this the way we want to do it sing the songs record [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFShx7Nxo-w&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
