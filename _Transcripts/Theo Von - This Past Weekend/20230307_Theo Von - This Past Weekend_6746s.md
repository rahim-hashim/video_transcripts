*  I've gotten to know him over the past few years and there is no one just more down to earth and enjoyable to be around than this man. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=71.34s)]
*  Today's guest is Hardy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Shine that light on me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=84.56s)]

*  This house is dope, dude. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=111.56s)]
*  I live like I could walk here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=112.56s)]
*  I would be tired, but I could walk here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=114.56s)]
*  Could you really? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=117.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would be tired. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=118.56s)]
*  It would take me 20 minutes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=119.56s)]
*  Are we rolling? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=120.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=121.56s)]
*  So it would take you how long to walk here? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=122.56s)]
*  I mean, maybe 30 minutes, but it's like two miles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=125.56s)]
*  It's like a mile and a half. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=128.56s)]
*  But that's not walking somewhere. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=129.56s)]
*  At that point, you're hitchhiking. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=130.56s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=134.56s)]
*  I could bum a ride here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=135.56s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=136.56s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=138.56s)]
*  Yeah, I could bum a ride here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=139.56s)]
*  I feel like that feels like a better statement. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=140.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why people don't use that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=142.56s)]
*  Because technically, you know how they're like, you could walk there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=145.56s)]
*  And technically, you could pretty much walk anywhere. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=148.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=152.56s)]
*  Until you had to swim or whatever. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=153.56s)]
*  Yeah, you could walk almost. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=154.56s)]
*  It's crazy to think of the old days when people were like, I'll head over. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=156.56s)]
*  And then you got there like four hours later. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=161.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=163.56s)]
*  Anything can happen between them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=164.56s)]
*  You wouldn't know. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=166.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=167.56s)]
*  You'd have to call somebody on a payphone and be like, I'll see you on Saturday. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=168.56s)]
*  And before payphones, it was like by letter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=172.56s)]
*  It was like, I'll be there next month. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=174.56s)]
*  And then they never showed up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=175.56s)]
*  And they just got killed by a bear or something. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=176.56s)]
*  Or people like a parent showed up and they're like, where's our daughter? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=179.56s)]
*  And the guy's like, ah, you know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=183.56s)]
*  She fucking died or something. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=184.56s)]
*  She went to get some water. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=185.56s)]
*  And I haven't seen her. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=186.56s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=187.56s)]
*  He took her life. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=188.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=189.56s)]
*  That's like some Game of Thrones shit, dude. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=190.56s)]
*  Oh, that's heartbreaking, man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=193.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=194.56s)]
*  We live in a more convenient time than ever. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=195.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=199.56s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=200.56s)]
*  It's so, yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=201.56s)]
*  Things are almost too convenient now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=202.56s)]
*  It is, dude. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=204.56s)]
*  We, I've, somebody needs to do a study on this, but I get, I think that like, do you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=205.56s)]
*  remember like in the nineties, eighties, whenever, but that when you heard a song on the radio [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=209.56s)]
*  that you loved and you, the next time you got to hear that song was on the radio. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=214.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=220.56s)]
*  So, and it was so euphoric to hear that song again because you didn't have access to it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=221.56s)]
*  where now it's like, if you like one song, you can go listen to every single thing that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=224.56s)]
*  artist or whatever has ever done. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=227.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=229.56s)]
*  And back then you had the luxury of having that euphoric moment of like, having that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=230.56s)]
*  to yourself, you know, and then having to like record it on the, on the fucking cassette. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=235.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=239.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=240.56s)]
*  Well, it almost felt magical too. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=241.56s)]
*  Like if it came on at a certain moment, it was like that, that was like the gods telling [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=242.56s)]
*  you this is it, you know? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=247.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=248.56s)]
*  Like, oh, I was driving by and this played and there she was. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=249.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=252.56s)]
*  And you had no control over it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=253.56s)]
*  It just had to happen to you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=254.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=255.56s)]
*  Now you can sit outside of somebody's house for like seven hours and play the same song [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=256.56s)]
*  over and over again, you know, until the cops show up and take you somewhere. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=260.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=264.56s)]
*  But it's like, you couldn't have before. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=265.56s)]
*  You couldn't. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=266.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=267.56s)]
*  You couldn't build up that dirty momentum like you can now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=268.56s)]
*  Dang dude, that is so crazy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=271.56s)]
*  But then think of how much power the DJ had back then. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=274.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=278.56s)]
*  Because he's like, you know what? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=279.56s)]
*  Right now I feel things out there kind of slipping, slipping out of our grasp. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=280.56s)]
*  I'm going to put you guys on something. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=284.56s)]
*  And he put out a love tune. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=286.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=288.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=289.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=290.56s)]
*  Or like we are the world. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=291.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=292.56s)]
*  Like, he controlled the narrative of people's lives back in the day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=293.56s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=294.56s)]
*  The DJ was powerful, wasn't he? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=295.56s)]
*  It was almost like the DJ had a dance. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=296.56s)]
*  It was like that, but for the whole city or a nation, it was like when that song came [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=297.56s)]
*  on, it was like, this is what everybody's going to feel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=304.56s)]
*  If somebody right now is like, if two spouses are fighting or whatever, the casserole ain't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=307.56s)]
*  good. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=312.56s)]
*  I'm about to hit them with this love ballad and everything's going to change. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=313.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=316.56s)]
*  And that's the only way that they could hear it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=317.56s)]
*  They couldn't do it themselves. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=318.56s)]
*  Unless they had a violin or something. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=319.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=322.56s)]

*  And people, people had always told you, you guys look like each other. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=652.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, dude, I get it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=655.64s)]
*  I'm seeing more memes and stuff now. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=657.64s)]
*  Are you? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=659.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=660.64s)]
*  And I like that night when we met, like he already knew about it apparently. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=661.64s)]
*  So like he made a joke. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=665.64s)]
*  He like was like my long lost brother, which kind of that, cause, cause I was a huge fan [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=667.64s)]
*  of Kid Rock back in the day, like massive and still am. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=671.64s)]
*  And I know him now, which is crazy, but I love him. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=673.64s)]
*  And, and, um, yeah, so he was in on the joke and like the first thing he did is like took [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=676.64s)]
*  my hat off and put his hat and was like, let's take a picture, you know, twins or whatever. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=680.64s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=684.64s)]
*  But yeah, that was that night. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=685.64s)]
*  I was, I was, I forgot about that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=686.64s)]
*  I was, that was really cool. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=687.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=688.64s)]
*  I think I honestly, I think I might've taken one of those pictures. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=689.64s)]
*  I want to look through my pictures and see, um, yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=691.64s)]
*  So where does some of that come from for you? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=695.64s)]
*  So, because some guys don't have that, both sides of that thing, they're really, they're [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=697.64s)]
*  in one world kind of, but you don't, you really walk, that's, you have a foot in both. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=701.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=706.64s)]
*  In both boots, man. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=707.64s)]
*  I tell everybody, like I grew up in a small town and you know, country, you know, I grew [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=708.64s)]
*  up 8,000 people and probably real similar at Covington, right? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=712.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=716.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=717.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=718.64s)]
*  Similar, just, just small, small ass town. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=719.64s)]
*  And so like growing up, that's everything lifestyle wise, I absorbed. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=720.64s)]
*  So that's like, that's where all the country comes from and the lyrics and all that stuff. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=725.64s)]
*  That's how I grew up. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=729.64s)]
*  But like, I did not listen to country music at all. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=730.64s)]
*  Who listened to music in your house? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=733.64s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=735.64s)]
*  My music, other than like God, you know, like music was number two behind, you know, religion [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=736.64s)]
*  in my, in my house. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=743.64s)]
*  Like, like, uh, there was always music playing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=744.64s)]
*  My sister was a really good singer. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=746.64s)]
*  Uh, my dad didn't play or sing, but he was like obsessed with rock and roll and my mom [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=748.64s)]
*  played piano. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=752.64s)]
*  So I mean, music was, you know, it was huge in my house. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=753.64s)]
*  So I had no choice, but to be obsessed with it growing up. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=756.64s)]
*  Do you remember like the first song you ever heard? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=759.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=761.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=762.64s)]
*  I have a vivid memory, dude. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=763.64s)]
*  It was a live by Pearl Jam. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=764.64s)]
*  I know where we were in Philadelphia, in Philadelphia, Mississippi. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=766.64s)]
*  We were in my dad's truck and he had a cassette and he said, listen to this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=770.64s)]
*  This is a band called Pearl Jam. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=774.64s)]
*  And he put the cassette in and that riff from a live started playing. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=775.64s)]
*  It was like something out of a movie, dude. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=778.64s)]
*  My brain chemistry just changed and I was like, what the fuck is this? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=780.64s)]
*  And I was like four, but I remember it's one of my first amazing, it changed my life forever. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=783.64s)]
*  Did you, and was it just you and your dad? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=790.64s)]
*  And that, in that moment? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=792.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=793.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=794.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=795.64s)]
*  And he, he, he saw it like then, like he, he was like, okay, this, you know, thank [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=796.64s)]
*  God, like my son loves rock and roll or whatever. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=799.64s)]
*  And so from then until I could like drive, basically, every time we got in the truck, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=801.64s)]
*  it was something new. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=806.64s)]
*  Aerosmith, there was ZZ Top, you know, and, but it was never country. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=807.64s)]
*  He liked a little bit of like Merle Haggard and like, I guess if you call John [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=811.64s)]
*  Prine country, like, but he knew he never played, it was always rock and roll. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=815.64s)]
*  So I owe all of my, and then I found, you know, then I got into like, by my like [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=819.64s)]
*  prime setting, like teen, you know, angst or music influence years was like [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=825.64s)]
*  Lincoln Park and like Puddle of Mud and all that new metal, Limp Bizkit and all [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=829.64s)]
*  that shit. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=832.64s)]
*  So I've kind of discovered that on my own, but I owe all of my childhood, like [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=833.64s)]
*  music taste or whatever to my dad. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=835.64s)]
*  It was all classic rock. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=837.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=838.64s)]
*  There's something interesting. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=839.64s)]
*  Cause Laney Wilson was just on here. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=840.64s)]
*  Yeah, I listened to it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=842.64s)]
*  Yeah, she's great. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=843.64s)]
*  Yeah. Awesome. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=844.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=845.64s)]
*  She like, I mean, yeah, she's magical. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=846.64s)]
*  And you guys have that great song together, man. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=848.64s)]
*  Wait in the truck. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=850.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=852.64s)]
*  And so, but I was thinking like, and I was talking on there about the first time [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=853.64s)]
*  that I heard a song, I was with my babysitter and I wonder sometimes if there's like [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=857.64s)]
*  something about just you and your dad together, like sometimes it takes like a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=863.64s)]
*  certain, like, I don't know what I'm thinking exactly, like, cause I remember it [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=867.64s)]
*  was that I was alone with, I'd never been in a car with somebody that wasn't like [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=872.64s)]
*  probably all my brothers and sisters at the same time or all of us. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=876.64s)]
*  I was like, my babysitter was taking me somewhere. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=879.64s)]
*  So it was me and her. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=881.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=882.64s)]
*  It was just like this moment. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=883.64s)]
*  And then she put in a cassette. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=884.64s)]
*  And so my senses were already real alert. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=885.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=887.64s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=888.64s)]
*  I never really thought about it like that, but I'm sure you and your dad had [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=889.64s)]
*  probably gone different places together, but that's cool that he put that in. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=891.64s)]
*  Dude, imagine if there's like a dad and he puts like a good song on for the kid [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=894.64s)]
*  and the kid doesn't give a shit. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=898.64s)]
*  Dude, coming from a music family, like it would have broken my dad's heart if I [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=900.64s)]
*  would have just looked and said like, I don't, I don't like this. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=904.64s)]
*  Can you just turn it? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=907.64s)]
*  Can we sit in silence? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=908.64s)]
*  A four year old just ask him if he could turn it off. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=909.64s)]
*  This hurts my ears or something, dude. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=912.64s)]
*  Bro, that'd be so crazy. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=913.64s)]
*  He would have, he would have died. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=915.64s)]
*  He would have hated that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=916.64s)]
*  Or the dad even puts on something that's kind of like just not even that great. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=917.64s)]
*  And the kids like, this is trash. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=921.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=923.64s)]
*  But the dad like loves his favorite song. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=924.64s)]
*  And he's just, the kids like this fucking sucks. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=925.64s)]
*  That would have been horrible, dude. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=927.64s)]
*  I hope that does not happen to me, dude. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=929.64s)]
*  That would break my heart if I have a kid one day. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=931.64s)]
*  I know that would have to be such a heartbreaker. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=933.64s)]
*  Dude, I think about that a lot. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=935.64s)]
*  Like imagine if your kid isn't smart and you have to like wish him good luck on a [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=936.64s)]
*  test or something when he leaves for school. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=940.64s)]
*  And you know, like the luck isn't, nothing's going to help. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=942.64s)]
*  I feel like parents probably go through that though. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=946.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=949.64s)]
*  Like your kid sucks at fucking volleyball, a lot of soccer. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=950.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=954.64s)]
*  But you go out, you just have like your kid likes it for whatever reason. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=955.64s)]
*  And you just have to go watch him like fail until they lose interest in it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=958.64s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=961.64s)]
*  If you have a kid who like, he loves like just not even being good at it kind of, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=962.64s)]
*  but he still wants to go. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=967.64s)]
*  Cause usually kids want to stop going if they're not good. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=968.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=971.64s)]
*  But I guess when you're like a young kid, I don't know. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=972.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=974.64s)]
*  I don't know what would go on in a kid's mind, but like T-ball, you know, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=975.64s)]
*  like if they're horrible, like does the kid, is the kid old enough to be like, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=979.64s)]
*  I'm not very good. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=983.64s)]
*  I don't feel like a kid would say, I'm not very good at this. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=984.64s)]
*  I don't want to do it anymore. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=987.64s)]
*  Maybe, maybe like seven or eight, but when they're real little, maybe not. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=988.64s)]
*  And then you have to have that talk, like, you know, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=992.64s)]
*  like especially parents that grew up like, you know, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=995.64s)]
*  middle-class or whatever you want to call it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=997.64s)]
*  And like they're spending money, you know, on this thing and they're, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=999.64s)]
*  you know, the kid's terrible. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1001.64s)]
*  Like does the parent sit them down and say like, look, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1002.64s)]
*  maybe you should find something that's you're going to actually be better at. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1004.64s)]
*  So we don't, we're not spending our money on this wasteful shit. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1007.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1011.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1012.64s)]
*  I think that's kind of, yeah, I'm trying to think of what I played. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1013.64s)]
*  I think I play, oh, our team was. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1016.64s)]
*  Did you play baseball? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1018.64s)]
*  Oh dude, I was bad. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1019.64s)]
*  I was unreal. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1021.64s)]
*  I couldn't even believe I was so bad. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1022.64s)]
*  At baseball? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  Dude, yeah. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  And the field we played on was like slanted, right? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  We had a bad something. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  Was it slanted down? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  Was it slanted down? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1029.64s)]
*  So would, so would a home run be easier to hit though? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1030.64s)]
*  Like cause you know, in golf, like if it's downhill, it's technically shorter. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1032.64s)]
*  Oh no, that would have been great. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1035.64s)]
*  Ours was just slanted over to the side to right field. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1036.64s)]
*  So every like kind of, if you hit it to third, it ended up like out in center field. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1040.64s)]
*  So it was. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1046.64s)]
*  What was the name of your part? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1047.64s)]
*  Oh, we played out at a Cordell furniture and American Legion. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1049.64s)]
*  Okay. American Legion. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1055.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1056.64s)]
*  So you played at American Legion. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1057.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1058.64s)]
*  Ours was Northside Park, but I'm pretty sure the American Legion was like right behind [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1059.64s)]
*  the park. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1064.64s)]
*  It's like that comes as a package deal. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1065.64s)]
*  It's like the national guard, the fire station and the American Legion, right? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1067.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1070.64s)]
*  Especially like in a smaller community. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1071.64s)]
*  That stuff was awesome. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1072.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1073.64s)]

*  It sounds like a perfect size. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1078.64s)]
*  8,000 is like kind of a great size. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1079.64s)]
*  It's the most cliche in a way, the most cliche in the best way, like small town, dude. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1081.64s)]
*  Like when you hear like a cliche ass country song about the courthouse square and the whole [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1086.64s)]
*  deal, it is the definition of a small town. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1091.64s)]
*  But dude, I hear a lot of people, I meet a lot of people that are like talk about where [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1095.64s)]

*  And there was obviously, you know, like drama and everything. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1107.64s)]
*  It was all, there was just as much bad as the good, but I was just very thankful for [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1111.64s)]
*  my time there and I still love to go. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1116.64s)]
*  We had it, dude. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1118.64s)]
*  The coolest thing about my hometown is we have a county fair and this is worth a Google [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1119.64s)]
*  called the Neshoba, N-E-S-H-O-B-A, Neshoba County Fair. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1123.64s)]

*  So that's, so y'all's county was Neshoba County, Mississippi. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1129.64s)]
*  Yeah, Neshoba. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1131.64s)]

*  I'm not sure. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1138.64s)]
*  I could be wrong or I could be completely wrong about that. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1139.64s)]
*  But dude, so this fair is everything else about it is just like a county fair. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1141.64s)]

*  But dude, it's, it's the most fun. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1170.64s)]
*  It's the most unique thing ever because the town literally shuts down and everybody in [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1172.64s)]
*  the little Quadra County area just goes to the fair and you, you, people take off work [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1176.64s)]
*  like, and you stay out there and just kind of party and hang out for a week. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1181.64s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1185.64s)]
*  And the, the houses and stuff, they're around a lake or they're around, around the fairgrounds. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1186.64s)]
*  Picture it like a giant like cookie cutter neighborhood somewhere. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1191.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1195.64s)]
*  And it's like 10 rows here. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1196.64s)]
*  And then you kind of go over and there's a little section here with a long row and then [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1197.64s)]
*  back over here. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1200.64s)]
*  But the, the, the like cornerstone of it is around, there's cabins that wrap around the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1201.64s)]
*  racetrack. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1206.64s)]

*  They're family owned. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1214.64s)]
*  Do they get broken up in divorces and wills? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1215.64s)]
*  They're, dude, if somebody sells one, you can sell them for like half a million dollars. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1218.64s)]

*  I was supposed to play it 2020. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1247.64s)]
*  I think it was last year. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1248.64s)]
*  It got canceled since the Civil War, not since the Civil War, World War II, since the depression, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1249.64s)]
*  I believe. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1254.64s)]
*  And, but so it got canceled. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1255.64s)]
*  So I played it in 2021 and it was like, it's like three, top three, like bucket list places [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1257.64s)]

*  And do people come in from around to see it or is more just the locals kind of go? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1268.64s)]
*  Well, the locals, it's the locals like have the cabins, right? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1271.64s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1275.64s)]
*  You'll have a, you'll have a crew like from Jackson that's had a cabin for forever or [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1276.64s)]

*  after they, you know, the people and all the chickens have been in there and it would break up [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1620.64s)]
*  the chicken shit and lay it back out like dry and like soft for the next chickens. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1624.64s)]

*  If not the last thing I'd want to come back, it would be one of those chickens, dude. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1687.64s)]

*  Yeah, we did better. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1697.64s)]
*  What, I'm trying to think, there's a bunch of stuff that I want to talk to you about. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1698.64s)]
*  What was it, what was it looking at earlier that I was thinking about? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1702.64s)]
*  Whenever you start getting into tunes, like what is the first instruments that you get? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1706.64s)]
*  Like who gets you keyed into music? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1710.64s)]
*  Like obviously your stuff your dad was listening to, you liked it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1712.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1715.64s)]
*  Your mom's playing music around the house. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1716.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1717.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1718.64s)]
*  So you're hearing a lot of good tunes. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1719.64s)]
*  When do you start to really get like an ear like, oh, this is something that I'm kind of good at? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1720.64s)]
*  I got a guitar when I was little. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1724.64s)]
*  I got like, my parents got me like a little Fender Squire, like a hundred dollar guitar [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1726.64s)]
*  and a little guitar amp when I was like probably fifth or sixth grade. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1732.64s)]
*  And I picked it up. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1736.64s)]
*  I learned like the bar court, like the easiest shit, like smoke on the water and crap. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1737.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1741.64s)]
*  Like Sweet Home Alabama and just all the shit that everybody learns. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1742.64s)]
*  Stairway to Heaven. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1744.64s)]
*  No, not even, bro. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1746.64s)]
*  I couldn't, that was, that was like expert level compared to the shit I was learning. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1747.64s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1751.64s)]
*  But yeah, and I picked that up and then like I got, I went into my teen years and I kind of put it back down [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1752.64s)]
*  and then I picked it up again when I was like 16 or 17. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1759.64s)]
*  And that's when I like started to really, I like figured out like songwriting and like all that kind of stuff [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1762.64s)]
*  and like actually learning a little bit more about the guitar and getting a little bit better and stuff. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1767.64s)]
*  It was like, like later in high school. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1771.64s)]
*  And did you feel more like a performer? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1774.64s)]
*  Did you feel like a writer? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1776.64s)]
*  Like when you, when you think about what you felt like that drew you to something, you know, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1777.64s)]
*  like, like some of the comedy, like, I don't know if I think of myself as a writer. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1781.64s)]
*  I think of myself as a performer. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1784.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1786.64s)]
*  It's like your delivery is me and, and, and yeah, like a performer. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1787.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1791.64s)]
*  Did you have one or did you have a? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1792.64s)]
*  Man, it was writing for me, dude. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1794.64s)]
*  It was writing for me until five years ago. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1795.64s)]
*  Like I moved to town to be a songwriter and my goal was to write hits for people. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1798.64s)]
*  And then so that I always had that in me. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1805.64s)]
*  Like in, like in my favorite class in school, I liked like biology because I loved animals and like being outside and all that kind of stuff. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1808.64s)]
*  But I was not a very good student, but I excelled randomly in writing. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1814.64s)]
*  And I was, I always had a really good knack for it, whether it was like essay, you know, like short stories, whatever you had to write in school. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1820.64s)]
*  And I just had a knack for it and I was obsessed with it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1827.64s)]
*  Like knowing that I had the ability to create a story or make something up or say something in writing was always like really important to me for whatever reason. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1829.64s)]
*  And now I know why. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1839.64s)]
*  Like that was just like, that was the gift that God gave me, I guess was my interest in writing or whatever. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1840.64s)]
*  And but so I, that's, it was always writing. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1845.64s)]
*  And then the record, like the artists thing, you know, people say doing the artist thing that came around the time, like Morgan's up down. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1849.64s)]
*  It was a hit like that because that was my first number one as a writer and it was his first number one as an artist. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1858.64s)]
*  And he was at Big Loud and I was writing other songs for other people at Big Loud. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1863.64s)]
*  And that's when they kind of came to me and they were just like, you know, do you want to do the artist thing? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1867.64s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1872.64s)]
*  And that was 20, it was 2018. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1873.64s)]
*  Damn, so that's not that long ago. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1876.64s)]
*  No, it feels like a time has flown by, but it also feels like forever ago. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1877.64s)]
*  But like I didn't, I was super apprehensive about it. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1881.64s)]
*  Well, most of that was COVID. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1885.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1886.64s)]
*  I mean, when I really, my shit finally kind of started going is when 2020 happened. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1887.64s)]
*  But I was, I saw like what Morgan was going through and it's not a bad thing. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1892.64s)]
*  It's great. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1896.64s)]
*  But like you, if you're, if your shit like pops off, like it, your life changes, you understand. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1897.64s)]
*  I mean, like your life changes forever. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1903.64s)]
*  And, and I just didn't know, like I had an offer on the table and I sat with it for months because I didn't know if I wanted to do it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1905.64s)]
*  I was, I'd had some success. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1912.64s)]
*  As a writer and I was like, man, it's you get to go write a fucking song and then go play golf every day or something. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1914.64s)]
*  And, and I just got done reading the Alchemist and that book, it talks about opportunities and omens and stuff like that a lot. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1920.64s)]
*  And so I had that in my head because it kept kind of getting brought up of like, you know, like, are you going to sign this record deal and blah, blah, blah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1927.64s)]
*  And then I finally just said, I'm going to do it because I didn't want to regret it later, you know, having turned it down or whatever. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1933.64s)]
*  I think it's awesome that you, that you did choose that. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1939.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, like Mississippi has a lot of great writers. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1942.64s)]
*  You know, I mean, over time, some of the greatest writers are from Mississippi and yeah, you Dora Welty, I think she's from Mississippi, right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1946.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1954.64s)]
*  Dude, and then you've got Elvis. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1955.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1957.64s)]
*  Robert Johnson, who arguably created rock and roll with the blues. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1958.64s)]
*  Does he have a, does his son, did his son play music too? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1961.64s)]
*  I think so. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1966.64s)]
*  I should know that, but I don't. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1967.64s)]
*  But yeah, and it's, it's nice to see Mrs. kind of like, you know, cause people, a lot of times, especially in the South, they put an artist on to a state, you know, it's good to see Louisiana and getting a guy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1968.64s)]
*  It's good to see Mississippi, you know, have a musician, you know, like that people can get behind and a guy that has his own point of view and stuff like that. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1979.64s)]
*  I think it's because also a place needs that, you know, there needs to be a young man in Mississippi right now who loves your music. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1988.64s)]
*  And then he's going to learn. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1996.64s)]
*  He might not even realize right now you're from Mississippi. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1997.64s)]
*  He might just, and then in five years he realized no way he's, I could do that. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=1999.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2003.64s)]
*  So that's how things happen. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2004.64s)]
*  Absolutely, man. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2005.64s)]
*  We had, are you familiar with Marty Stewart? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2006.64s)]
*  He's a big bluegrass guy. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2008.64s)]
*  Pull him up, please. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2010.64s)]
*  He had, he had a, he had a couple of hits in just a regular country format in the nineties, but he's a really famous roots, like bluegrass guy. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2011.64s)]
*  And he, there he is. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2019.64s)]
*  He is from Philadelphia, Mississippi. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2022.64s)]
*  And so when I was a kid, he was the shit. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2024.64s)]
*  And so exactly what you're saying, like I always had that in my mind of like, well, somebody from Philly went and did it, you know, and he really made it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2027.64s)]
*  I mean, he's very, very respected in the country. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2035.64s)]
*  He's really big in the Opry and like all that, you know, and I've certainly heard his name before. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2038.64s)]
*  So it was inspiring, man. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2042.64s)]
*  That was like, I knew it was like exactly what you said. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2043.64s)]
*  Like it can be done. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2047.64s)]
*  And that gave me the courage to move up here and give it a shot. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2048.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, there's a part of your brain that you don't even know that's working, that it's like, okay, that's in my head that that's possible. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2050.64s)]
*  And until that little thing, until that little coin gets put in your bank, your brain doesn't really have that as a, as, as, as part of its account. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2057.64s)]
*  Yeah. You're not like hyper focused on that. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2066.64s)]
*  It's just your subconscious. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2068.64s)]
*  No, it's just, yeah, your subconscious like, oh, this can happen in your subconscious. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2069.64s)]
*  That, you know, it just starts to be part of the, uh, your assets, you know, in the background, you're like, oh, then eventually it can happen. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2072.64s)]
*  My favorite comedian, one of the reasons I believe that I got into comedy and storytelling myself, um, my best friend Scott, he's a, uh, his dad is from Jackson. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2080.64s)]
*  His family's from Jackson, Mississippi. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2090.64s)]
*  Yeah. Cool. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2092.64s)]
*  And I would go up there and he would play Jerry Clower for me. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2093.64s)]
*  Oh, come on, dude. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2097.64s)]
*  Speaking my language, he would play Jerry Clow. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2099.64s)]
*  Knock him out, John. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2101.64s)]
*  Knock him out, John. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2102.64s)]
*  Come on. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2103.64s)]
*  And he'd be like from Yazoo City, Mississippi. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2104.64s)]
*  That's it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2106.64s)]
*  And, and I was like, oh my God, like this guy, like he's, it just, it's amazing what he's doing and like that, that this is a possible thing. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2107.64s)]
*  And I think hearing that to this day has had a big effect on the fact that, um, that I got into storytelling and that I like it or that I believed maybe that I could do it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2115.64s)]
*  Um, do you think like, was he kind of the first guy that really based his comedy around Southern ideals and stuff? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2126.64s)]
*  I think he was a really, well, he sounded very Southern. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2135.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2140.64s)]
*  But I think he was probably just a good storyteller and he had a lot of that, like, um, the lead bettors, you know, like he named people in his neighborhood and characters. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2141.64s)]
*  So when you were listening to him, you start, he had this world was being built. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2151.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2154.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2155.64s)]
*  And so I think I, I, that was fascinating to me. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2156.64s)]
*  Cause you talk a lot about people from your hometown and stuff. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2159.64s)]
*  That was an influence or whatever. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2162.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2163.64s)]
*  No, I think it probably had a lot to do with it. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2164.64s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2165.64s)]
*  But it was funny cause yeah, my best friend's dad, he said, yeah, you should, you gotta listen to this guy. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2166.64s)]
*  You'll love him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2171.64s)]
*  And he put them on. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2172.64s)]
*  I just, I couldn't believe it was a thing, you know, and then, man, that's awesome, dude. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2173.64s)]
*  I haven't really heard Jerry Clower in a long time that I remember my childhood didn't play in him too. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2178.64s)]
*  Everybody knew his bits, right? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2184.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2185.64s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2186.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2187.64s)]
*  And you got, and there's, there's video you see him performing. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2188.64s)]
*  He always wore this kind of like loud red outfit. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2190.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2193.64s)]
*  He was a big dude too, right? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2194.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2195.64s)]
*  And he was a drug. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2196.64s)]
*  He had a cocaine problem for a while and he ended up being a pastor, I think towards the end of his years. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2197.64s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2200.64s)]
*  His wife still lives in Mississippi, but. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2201.64s)]
*  He passed not like that long ago, right? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2203.64s)]
*  10, 15 years ago, something like that. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2205.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2207.64s)]
*  I'm not sure when he passed. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2208.64s)]
*  I would say 10. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2209.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2210.64s)]
*  It sounded like about 10 or 15 years ago. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2211.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2212.64s)]
*  But one day I was getting out of my car at the mall and this guy comes running up and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2213.64s)]
*  he goes, Hey man, I've heard you say that my grandfather is your favorite comedian. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2218.64s)]
*  And it was his grandson. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2223.64s)]
*  Here? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2224.64s)]
*  Jonathan Clower. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2225.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2226.64s)]
*  Here. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2227.64s)]
*  No way, dude. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2228.64s)]
*  Do you look like him? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2229.64s)]
*  It was pretty cool. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2230.64s)]
*  Was he a big dude? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2231.64s)]
*  I mean, he was young, so it's hard to be like, I didn't want to fucking, you know. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2232.64s)]
*  Dude, that's really cool though. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2233.64s)]
*  He lives in Nashville. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2234.64s)]
*  Put him in old clothes and see how he looked. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2235.64s)]
*  He didn't have like the old like puffed up fucking hair. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2236.64s)]
*  It would have been crazy if he just had old ass hair. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2237.64s)]
*  He was born like that. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2238.64s)]
*  So how'd you get over to, so at that point, so you're starting to write, you're in school. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2239.64s)]
*  How do you get over to Mississippi State? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2240.64s)]
*  That's where you went, right? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2241.64s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2242.64s)]
*  I moved to Nat. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2243.64s)]
*  Dude, this is my biggest. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2244.64s)]
*  And I understand like if I didn't move up here when I did, like my life would be completely [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2245.64s)]
*  different, but that's like my biggest life regret is that both my parents went to state [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2248.64s)]
*  and I was like, I'm going to go to college. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2253.64s)]
*  I'm going to go to college. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2254.64s)]
*  I'm going to go to college. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2255.64s)]
*  I'm going to go to college. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2256.64s)]
*  I'm going to go to college. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2257.64s)]
*  I went to one semester at a junior college called East Central Community College in Decatur, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2266.64s)]
*  Mississippi. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2274.64s)]
*  But no, I didn't go to state. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2275.64s)]
*  I actually went to middle Tennessee down here in Murfreesboro. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2277.64s)]
*  And you got your degree from there eventually? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2280.64s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2282.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2283.64s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2284.64s)]
*  Commercial songwriting. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2285.64s)]
*  Dang, really? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2286.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2287.64s)]
*  So you just went and took a class on it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2288.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2289.64s)]
*  I mean, it's like a poor man's Belmont. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2290.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2291.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2292.64s)]
*  Like all the kids, all the belt, the kids that didn't get into Belmont, which is like, you [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2293.64s)]
*  know, the big music. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2294.64s)]
*  I mean, it literally sits at the end of music row down here. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2295.64s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, and the songwriting class was like, whatever. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2298.64s)]
*  And I've said this before and I feel kind of uncomfortable because I know there's people [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2303.64s)]
*  watching it probably that go to MTSU there. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2306.64s)]
*  But like when I was there, it was like there was no filter. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2308.64s)]
*  So it was like a bunch of people that just weren't very good. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2311.64s)]
*  And so like it was like, okay, today we're going to learn about writing a verse and it's [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2313.64s)]
*  there's got to be structure and each line has to rhyme. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2318.64s)]
*  It's just stuff that, you know, like most people knew. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2320.64s)]
*  But there were a couple of kids in there that like got it. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2322.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2324.64s)]
*  Like you were you like you had to play a song you wrote every week and they'd critique it [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2325.64s)]
*  and talk about it and this and that and the other. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2328.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2330.64s)]
*  And there was some people in there were horrible. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2331.64s)]
*  And but there were some kids in there that were really good. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2333.64s)]
*  But you could tell like that was what I took away was like the people that had it had it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2335.64s)]
*  But you can't like learn it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2339.64s)]
*  Like you can't. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2340.64s)]
*  In my opinion, like I don't know if you could like say, man, I owe all of my songwriting [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2341.64s)]
*  success to the songwriting class at MTSU because it's like songwriters, it's like any [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2345.64s)]
*  other form of writing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2351.64s)]
*  It's like everybody has that weird internal voice and that's how they write and stuff. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2352.64s)]
*  And I feel like people are just born with that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2356.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2358.64s)]
*  I think you can hone things. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2359.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2361.64s)]
*  And you can like fine tune them. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2362.64s)]
*  You can whittle them. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2363.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2364.64s)]
*  You know, you could put a little bit of, you know, you could put something in a cross. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2365.64s)]
*  You know, you could put icing on something. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2368.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2370.64s)]
*  But you got to have something. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2371.64s)]
*  You got to have the natural kind of thing, I think. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2372.64s)]
*  But I learned a lot about the industry there, like record deals and publishing. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2375.64s)]
*  I mean, I learned a ton about all that stuff and like even recording studio stuff. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2379.64s)]
*  Like I got all of that, all of that stuff from MTSU. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2384.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2388.64s)]
*  And then the first time you hear those things in business, it's not the first time you've [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2389.64s)]
*  ever heard them, you know? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2392.64s)]
*  So it's interesting how like some people know I took a comedy class, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2393.64s)]
*  So I went to, I was in, I was out in Los Angeles, you know, and everybody was just, you know, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2397.64s)]
*  it was, when you first get out there, that's a lot of like kind of per like every people [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2404.64s)]
*  like they'll have agents and managers will sign you, but just because they're damn pedophiles [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2408.64s)]
*  or something, you know, it's like they'll try to get you out to dinner and then they [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2412.64s)]
*  give you a ride home and they're squeezing on your leg or something, you know? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2415.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2418.64s)]
*  Asking if you got any leftovers on you or something. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2419.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2421.64s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2422.64s)]
*  Just some slimy shit. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2423.64s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2424.64s)]
*  You know, I don't have any leftovers, but it's like, yeah, it's just a lot of pervs out [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2425.64s)]
*  there. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2429.64s)]
*  But eventually I found, you know, I said no to all that. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2430.64s)]
*  And then I got into a comedy class and I was like, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2433.64s)]
*  the best thing about it was I thought I was probably in my head. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2438.64s)]
*  I thought I was better than the class maybe in a weird way or I didn't, but it made you [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2442.64s)]
*  at the end of the class, you had to get on stage after six, you know, and then I realized [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2447.64s)]
*  as a class went on, some people were better joke writers and they were better like, or [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2452.64s)]
*  get to keeping their stuff or I just came in with a little bit of an attitude, I think, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2455.64s)]
*  but at the end you got on stage. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2458.64s)]
*  So how long was it? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2460.64s)]
*  How long do you have to go for? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2462.64s)]
*  It was six weeks and it was probably the actual performance. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2463.64s)]
*  Oh, three minutes. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2466.64s)]
*  That's three minutes. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2467.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2468.64s)]
*  Damn. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2469.64s)]
*  So they didn't give you, you had to like, you had to give it everything you got then. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2470.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2472.64s)]
*  And it was like, and the first week is like, at the end we're going to do a three minute [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2473.64s)]
*  performance. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2477.64s)]
*  You're like, I got that. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2478.64s)]
*  And then like the day of, I mean, you're, you know, you're losing it. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2479.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2482.64s)]
*  You know, people are just damn, you know, just losing it, jumping off a really small [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2483.64s)]
*  buildings, not hurting themselves, but just, you know, just practice it in case they can't [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2487.64s)]
*  handle it. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2491.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2492.64s)]
*  But, um, it got, yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2493.64s)]
*  But then we got on stage and that was the thing that was the breaker. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2494.64s)]
*  It was like, for you guys having to have a song at the end of the week, it's like, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2498.64s)]
*  yeah, that's the thing where it's like, okay. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2501.64s)]
*  Cause if I don't get on stage then I don't know if I ever get on stage. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2503.64s)]
*  Can you do it? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2506.64s)]
*  Can you actually do it? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2507.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2508.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2509.64s)]
*  And once you get that first, can you do it? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2510.64s)]
*  Once you get that first, like open mic or I'm going to write a song and play it in [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2512.64s)]
*  front of other people. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2517.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2518.64s)]
*  Once you get through that first time, everything changes. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2519.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2522.64s)]
*  Cause then you have a real clear idea on if you're capable of it or what part of it [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2523.64s)]
*  you're capable of the most. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2528.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2529.64s)]
*  And that's all contingent on your audience too, right? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2530.64s)]
*  In a way. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2532.64s)]
*  Cause you don't know if you killed it or if you did a good job, unless somebody tells [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2533.64s)]
*  you people that you know, you can trust. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2536.64s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2538.64s)]
*  But I think you get a feeling as to, okay, maybe I loved writing it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2539.64s)]
*  Maybe I didn't love being up there. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2543.64s)]
*  Maybe, I mean, you just get more information. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2544.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2547.64s)]
*  You know, it's crazy that the, the, the, how much, how little information you have before [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2548.64s)]
*  that first step, almost with anything. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2552.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2555.64s)]
*  That's really true, man. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2556.64s)]
*  You know, it's like very true, especially for getting on any type of stage. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2557.64s)]
*  It's like, you just don't, you know, yes, it's going to be thrown to the wolves in that [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2561.64s)]
*  moment. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2564.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2565.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2566.64s)]
*  But it, but right after that, you're like, all right, you know. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2567.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2569.64s)]
*  And then you get into like immediately, I feel that like you can immediately be like [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2570.64s)]
*  your brain starts ticking on like what you could have done better and like how to make [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2574.64s)]
*  it better, but you don't know that until you do it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2577.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2579.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2580.64s)]
*  And it's so crazy. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2581.64s)]
*  The difference between I didn't do it yet till I just did it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2582.64s)]
*  You'll come off be like, and suddenly you'll be like, next time I'm going to do it this [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2585.64s)]
*  way. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2588.64s)]
*  And you're like, what am I saying next time? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2589.64s)]
*  That means I want to do it again. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2590.64s)]
*  It's like just the little information that you get from taking that first step. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2591.64s)]
*  Dude. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2596.64s)]
*  And that's such a cool snowball effect too, cause it just, it gets better and better. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2597.64s)]
*  And like you're constantly critiquing yourself and telling yourself next time, which is [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2600.64s)]
*  manifesting that you're going to, it's going to get bigger and better and all that. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2604.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2607.64s)]
*  True. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2608.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2609.64s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2610.64s)]
*  That is man. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2611.64s)]
*  When you write a song, like, so you guys write, you and Laney wrote weight in the truck. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2612.64s)]
*  No. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2617.64s)]
*  So I, so she, she did not, she did not write it. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2618.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2621.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2622.64s)]
*  So you write the song with other writers. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2623.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2624.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2625.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2626.64s)]
*  Just it's like going to work and you just, you know, go in a room and throw out your [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2627.64s)]
*  ideas and sit around and write a song. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2631.64s)]
*  Now say you walk in a room, right. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2633.64s)]
*  And you see the other writers in there. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2635.64s)]
*  Is there sometimes you're like, all right, I'm gonna put a certain ideas and sometimes [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2637.64s)]
*  I'm keeping some in. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2640.64s)]
*  Totally. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2641.64s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2642.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2643.64s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2644.64s)]
*  Like if you're, this is like, if you have a like balling ass, bad ass idea, like I'll [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2645.64s)]
*  sit on that until I know I'm in a room, because if you throw it out, especially in Nashville [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2650.64s)]
*  or LA, it can be a little greasier where like people will take back ideas, but you just [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2655.64s)]
*  don't do that really in Nashville. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2658.64s)]
*  Like, it's not as dog eat dog. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2660.64s)]
*  Let's just put it that way as it is in LA. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2663.64s)]
*  And, but like I'll wait until I'm with some of my buddies or people that will completely [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2665.64s)]
*  grasp a cool idea. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2671.64s)]
*  So, you know, you're going to nail it. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2672.64s)]
*  Cause I've made the mistake of throwing out a really good title with some people that [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2674.64s)]
*  just couldn't latch onto it as well as maybe other people could. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2678.64s)]
*  And you just kind of ruin the idea. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2681.64s)]
*  And then you can't really write it again or you're an asshole. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2683.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2686.64s)]
*  Cause then other people are attached to it and that sort of thing. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2687.64s)]
*  Then you get, then that's when like you'll, you know, then if you did write it 10 years [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2690.64s)]
*  later, then you got to add these people because they were there when you know, and they're [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2693.64s)]
*  like, well, I said that line and you use that in this song too. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2696.64s)]
*  But yeah, there's definitely times. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2699.64s)]
*  Like, Wait in the Trucks is a perfect example. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2700.64s)]
*  So, Hunter Phelps is like one of my best friends and I wrote that with him and Jordan Schmidt, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2702.64s)]
*  who's also one of my best friends. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2707.64s)]
*  You know, I'm pointing that way cause Jordan lives right down the road. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2708.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2710.64s)]
*  And Hunter and I kind of came up with that idea together and we knew Jordan was a really [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2711.64s)]
*  incredible writer and that that was the time to bring that idea out and write it with somebody. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2718.64s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2723.64s)]
*  That's wild, man. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2724.64s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2725.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2726.64s)]
*  It's interesting cause I guess in the beginning you might go in and just put all your eggs [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2727.64s)]
*  out there and the other two people, one of them shows up hung over one of them is pre, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2728.64s)]
*  you know, not pre, it could be. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2733.64s)]
*  They just found out they're pregnant. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2735.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2736.64s)]
*  So the day is fucking ruined. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2737.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2738.64s)]
*  Their day is wrecked. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2739.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2740.64s)]
*  And then you're like, damn man, you just don't get it to fruition. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2741.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2746.64s)]
*  And it, dude, it breaks my heart when I have a great idea and then you kind of ruin it [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2747.64s)]
*  cause then you're just like, fuck. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2750.64s)]
*  Like that, that, that, I mean, really to get into the technique or the not to be vain or [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2753.64s)]
*  not vain, but materialistic, but you're like, I just missed out on like $200,000 because [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2759.64s)]
*  I had a hit idea and I just ruined it on these people. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2763.64s)]
*  It happens, dude. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2766.64s)]
*  And you just kind of beat yourself up about it and like this and that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2767.64s)]
*  Some people even go home and completely rewrite the idea and make it better and be like, send [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2770.64s)]
*  it back to the people you wrote it with. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2774.64s)]
*  And you're like, I like this. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2775.64s)]
*  You guys can be on the song, but I completely rewrote the song or whatever. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2777.64s)]
*  Does that happen sometimes where somebody will write it to other people in the room [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2780.64s)]
*  and they get a part of the credit and that's that. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2783.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2785.64s)]
*  The rule in Nashville is drop a word or say a word, take a third, you know, like it doesn't [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2786.64s)]
*  matter if you're having a bad day. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2792.64s)]
*  And that there's like it always evens itself out because like you go into a room with two [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2794.64s)]
*  other people and one of the guys sits over there and doesn't say a word. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2800.64s)]
*  He's still on the song. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2803.64s)]
*  He still has a third of the song like frickin Boo wordly over there. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2804.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2807.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2808.64s)]
*  Radley. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2809.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2810.64s)]
*  Like sitting over there like fucking just not saying a damn word, just staring at his [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2811.64s)]
*  phone or something. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2814.64s)]
*  But then there's times where you might not be on your A game and somebody else, two of [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2815.64s)]
*  the other guys or guys or girls are killing it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2818.64s)]
*  And yeah, you know, it's just like a Nashville. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2820.64s)]
*  I know in L.A. like they have lawyers that people like sitting in on rights, like paying [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2822.64s)]
*  attention to who said what and then they like get in and they try to like negotiate who [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2826.64s)]
*  contributed the most. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2830.64s)]
*  And that's like the percentage they get that hasn't made it here yet. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2831.64s)]
*  I hope it doesn't miss. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2834.64s)]
*  Sounds stressful. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2835.64s)]
*  It ruins everything. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2838.64s)]
*  L.A. will ruin anything. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2839.64s)]
*  Are you still out there? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2842.64s)]
*  You still have you still about there at all? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2843.64s)]
*  Yeah, I probably spent about almost three, I would say almost four months maybe. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2845.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2849.64s)]
*  Out of the year out there because I have to practice out there. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2850.64s)]
*  I can't really practice comedy in Nashville. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2852.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2854.64s)]
*  So Zany's is at the only spot here. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2855.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2857.64s)]
*  That's kind of surprising. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2858.64s)]
*  I mean, it's good for them, I guess, because they have like they I mean, it's like that [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2859.64s)]
*  until you until you're bigger than that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2863.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2865.64s)]
*  And then you do like the rhyming or something. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2866.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2867.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2868.64s)]
*  So we could do other places. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2869.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2870.64s)]
*  It's like but if I want to practice, you know, like in L.A., you can pro I can do three spots [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2871.64s)]
*  a night. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2874.64s)]
*  Is that like Comedy Store and stuff like that? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2875.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2878.64s)]
*  Improv, Comedy Store. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2879.64s)]
*  There's a place called the Bourbon Room that's really popping. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2880.64s)]
*  West Side Comedy. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2883.64s)]
*  There's I mean, you could do five in a night if you wanted to. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2885.64s)]
*  But at a certain point, you're just driving around like perform. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2887.64s)]
*  You're not really learning anything. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2890.64s)]
*  You know, you just like show up and see the guy that runs the thing. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2891.64s)]
*  And you're like, y'all got a spot for me or do you schedule an event? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2895.64s)]
*  No, on Mondays, you put in your avails. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2898.64s)]
*  So that I mean, you can someplace you could stop in and they'll let you get up if you [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2900.64s)]
*  have a certain level of, I guess, success. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2905.64s)]
*  Notoriety or whatever. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2907.64s)]
*  Notoriety probably is a better term. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2908.64s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2910.64s)]
*  That always feels uncomfortable to me. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2911.64s)]
*  Like I always hate. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2913.64s)]
*  Does it feel like you're crashing a party? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2914.64s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2915.64s)]
*  And it feels like it's not your, you know, somebody else drove up there. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2916.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2919.64s)]
*  They might have a couple of children. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2920.64s)]
*  They might be expecting to get home. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2921.64s)]
*  I don't want to wreck that guy's. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2922.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2924.64s)]
*  Or, you know, I don't want to have him get home 30 minutes later. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2925.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2927.64s)]
*  You know. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2928.64s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2929.64s)]
*  That's like just out of respect. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2930.64s)]
*  It's like showing up to somebody's show and then somebody pointing you out and then you [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2931.64s)]
*  get up there and play for an hour and steal the show or something. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2934.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2936.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2937.64s)]
*  Like if you want to do one, you know, but, but, but yeah, I think, yeah. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2938.64s)]
*  So that kind of thing is a little bit uncomfortable kind of a, so I would rather, I like to, and [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2940.64s)]
*  I like to know in advance when I'm gonna have to go, go to work. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2944.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2946.64s)]
*  You know, cause now it's, it is more like going to work. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2947.64s)]
*  Um, is it interesting? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2949.64s)]
*  Does that start to feel like that for you? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2950.64s)]
*  Like in the beginning that it was a lot more of like, this is fun and it's still fun. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2952.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2959.64s)]
*  But once it becomes your work, it becomes your work. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2960.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2964.64s)]
*  I mean, man, I would almost argue and say that the more into it I get, like the, the, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2965.64s)]
*  the more the years have gone by, the more fun it feels and the less. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2973.64s)]
*  Cause when you're, if you just start out, man, and you're like, you've got a new brand [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2977.64s)]
*  new single, you're doing like radio tour. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2982.64s)]
*  And I mean, you're grinding so hard and you're playing shitty shows for people that you're [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2984.64s)]
*  either opening for somebody and the crowd is not there for you. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2990.64s)]
*  Cause they have no fucking idea who you are. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2993.64s)]
*  So, but then the more you're established, I feel like, I mean, it, it still feels like [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=2995.64s)]
*  work. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3000.64s)]
*  It's just a crazy job, but it's, it's, I think it's more fun. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3001.64s)]
*  The more like, you know, success you have, which I guess that that makes, you know, that's [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3004.64s)]
*  obvious, but [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3009.64s)]
*  No, it's not obvious really. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3010.64s)]
*  I don't think I think it's interesting. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3011.64s)]
*  Cause it's like, yeah, I don't know if I guess there's different ways to look at it or different [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3013.64s)]
*  ways that it kind of happened in the way you perceived it. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3021.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3024.64s)]
*  Because I think some people would say that it was more fun in those other moments. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3025.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3033.64s)]
*  And I guess in some ways it is more, it's like, you don't know what's going to happen. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3034.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3039.64s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3040.64s)]
*  Like there's so much left to wonder, like what's going to come of that. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3041.64s)]
*  You mean? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3045.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3046.64s)]
*  Or what the other side of the coin can look like a little. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3047.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3048.64s)]
*  I mean, I think it's more fun. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3049.64s)]
*  Isn't the overall word that we're kind of looking at. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3050.64s)]
*  It's like, it's all fun, but some of it's [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3053.64s)]
*  Thrilling, more thrilling in a way or [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3055.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3059.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3060.64s)]
*  I mean, I'm just trying to figure it out. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3061.64s)]
*  And today's one of those days where I'm not figuring it out that good, you know, but that's [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3062.64s)]
*  okay, man. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3067.64s)]
*  Um, but yeah, it's, it's definitely, there's things that are more, well, there's more intrigue. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3068.64s)]
*  I feel like, but I don't know, because then you get different opportunities. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3077.64s)]
*  You're like, Oh God, this is what this feels like. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3081.64s)]
*  You know, it's like, I think it's all, it kind of comes in like not waves, but even [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3083.64s)]
*  levels, right? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3087.64s)]
*  Like that's a good word, you know, cause then you have a, you have like a big record and [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3088.64s)]
*  then, then you're kind of like new to a newer scene of more of a higher level, you know, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3093.64s)]
*  and then there's more wonder and all that. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3098.64s)]
*  And then like you blow up again or have another big moment. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3100.64s)]
*  And I don't know, I feel like it could be kind of tiered, but it's all relative. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3103.64s)]
*  It's all the same situation, but just at different levels of success. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3106.64s)]
*  Maybe I think that's a good way to say it. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3110.64s)]
*  I remember, uh, going to you guys's show at the, in Nashville, Bridgestone, Bridgestone. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3112.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3120.64s)]
*  And I remember seeing the, uh, arrows on the flutter taped on the floor where the, where [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3121.64s)]
*  the artists go and go up and like, you know, cause it's dark back there. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3127.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3130.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3131.64s)]
*  Everything really dark. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3132.64s)]
*  And I remember thinking, Oh man, how cool, you know, I've always wanted to be in the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3133.64s)]
*  show. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3135.64s)]
*  I've always wanted to be like, see what the rock star sees, you know, and like stage and [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3136.64s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3141.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3142.64s)]
*  It was just like, and I have my own backstage at shows and there it's different, you know, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3143.64s)]
*  it's just with comedy, it's a lot different. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3146.64s)]
*  It's really subdued. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3148.64s)]
*  It's just, you're sitting back there. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3149.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3150.64s)]
*  And I was going to say, there's probably not, it's not all hustle and bustle because there's [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3151.64s)]
*  not like the production's not like a country, like, or any, like a concert. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3153.64s)]
*  Oh, there's nobody to damn bum a vape off of you. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3157.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3165.64s)]
*  And it's like, it's like quiet and more chill. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3166.64s)]
*  It's dead quiet. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3168.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3169.52s)]

*  Thursday night. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3455.54s)]
*  To me, I thought Thursday and Friday were the best. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3456.66s)]
*  It was Thursday night, St. Patty's or was that Friday? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3458.7s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3461.94s)]

*  It was like, I could see it from all the way at the top. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3466.42s)]
*  Like people were falling over and stuff. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3469.54s)]
*  Oh, that might have been Saturday. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3471.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't, yeah, I don't think when I left I remember seeing people doing St. Patty's [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3472.2599999999998s)]
*  stuff. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3476.18s)]
*  It might have been, it might have been. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3477.18s)]
*  Might have been Saturday. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3478.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3479.18s)]
*  Is there a night that you guys like to, is there a night when you feel like the shows [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3480.18s)]
*  are better or a day? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3485.1s)]
*  Is there a show that, give me that day and time that a country per show or that a performance, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3486.1s)]
*  a musical performance is the best. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3492.46s)]
*  Friday nights, usually in the summer. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3495.62s)]
*  Because Thursday night a lot of people have to go to work so they're there and they'll [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3500.18s)]
*  stay up late but they're not going to party. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3503.7799999999997s)]
*  And then Saturday night a lot of people go to church, especially in a country crowd. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3506.14s)]
*  Friday night is like, I just got off of work and I don't have shit to do tomorrow. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3510.18s)]
*  That's the one every time. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3514.94s)]
*  Even if you do, you can feel it, especially when you, if you do three nights at one venue, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3516.42s)]
*  you can see the difference between Thursday, Friday and Saturday. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3522.86s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3525.82s)]
*  And the Saturday crowds like more tired and hungover, you know what I mean? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3526.82s)]
*  They're all good, but like Friday night, nothing ever beats Friday night. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3529.94s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3532.86s)]
*  Damn. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3533.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3534.86s)]
*  Because for comedy it's different. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3535.86s)]
*  Friday night is the toughest night. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3536.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3537.86s)]
*  Why do you think so? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3538.86s)]
*  I think it's because people have been working. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3539.86s)]
*  They get off and I don't think they want to be kind of still in a space where they have [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3541.14s)]
*  to sit and kind of listen. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3545.1s)]
*  Pay attention. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3547.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3548.22s)]
*  I think their attention is a little burnout. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3549.22s)]
*  They either want to fucking rip their dick off, you know, or not, they're somebody's [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3551.7s)]
*  dick. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3555.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3556.2599999999998s)]
*  They want to rip a tit off or whatever and get a damn Michelob in them or they want to, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3557.2599999999998s)]
*  or they want to chill out. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3563.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3565.9s)]
*  But I don't think they want that middle ground. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3566.9s)]
*  Well, I wonder why that's different. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3568.14s)]
*  But it's notoriously the worst. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3570.06s)]
*  Steve Martin quit performing touring. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3571.2599999999998s)]
*  On Friday nights? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3573.8199999999997s)]
*  Because, totally. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3574.8199999999997s)]
*  I think, but because if you go out and you're just waiting Thursday to Saturday, I think [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3575.8199999999997s)]
*  it's just kind of a low, but he said he quit performing because Friday night. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3579.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3583.22s)]
*  It's that big of a difference. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3584.22s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3587.42s)]
*  I mean, I guess, I don't know. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3588.42s)]
*  It's crazy because I guess you don't have to pay attention at a concert. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3591.34s)]
*  This is super artsy. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3595.22s)]
*  I guess you feel music more than you actually pay attention to. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3597.1s)]
*  So maybe that's a little bit more of a release than feeling like having to sit and focus [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3600.94s)]
*  on something maybe. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3604.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3605.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3606.62s)]
*  Oh, it's interesting. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3607.62s)]
*  That is interesting. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3608.62s)]
*  Sometimes it stands up. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3609.62s)]
*  I think in the end it gets in your head that Friday's gonna be, you know, might not be, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3610.62s)]
*  but then I don't know, half the time I feel like I can't really tell the difference. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3613.22s)]
*  Dude, what other, if you take Louisiana out of the equation, what's your favorite city [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3616.34s)]
*  to play in? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3619.98s)]
*  Oh, dang, dude. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3620.98s)]
*  Anywhere in Texas is good. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3622.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3623.86s)]

*  Dude, do you know that Georgia, our Georgia was the same thing? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3647.14s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3651.22s)]
*  I think it was like Australia for Americans and they would send, and you can fact check [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3652.54s)]
*  me because I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it was a place where if you went bankrupt [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3656.4199999999996s)]
*  or committed a crime, they would send you down to Georgia because Georgia is one of [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3661.7799999999997s)]
*  the, I think one of the 13 colonies. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3666.8199999999997s)]
*  It's one of the original. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3669.4599999999996s)]
*  If not, it's like it was very early and they would send it down there to send you down [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3670.4599999999996s)]

*  18th century Georgia was really just King George's penal colony, right? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3686.38s)]
*  Can you zoom in a little bit more? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3692.26s)]
*  As conceived by its founder, James Oglethorpe and his trustees in London, Georgia was expressly [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3698.1400000000003s)]
*  built on the theory of work release. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3703.7400000000002s)]
*  They convinced King George the overcrowding in prisons. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3708.06s)]
*  It's fair to say that scores are recently released. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3717.02s)]
*  People of the King's house of corrections were among the colonists. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3719.98s)]
*  Huh? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3722.2999999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3723.2999999999997s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3724.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, the hears, hold on then. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3725.2999999999997s)]
*  This might go for the whole STC because Louisiana, they said it was like criminals and prostitutes [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3728.94s)]
*  from France. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3737.18s)]
*  Really? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3738.18s)]
*  They settled like in New Orleans? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3739.18s)]
*  No, in France they're like, if you want to marry a prostitute, we'll give you land in [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3740.66s)]
*  Louisiana. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3746.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3747.3799999999997s)]
*  I just tweeted something about it. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3748.3799999999997s)]
*  I just saw something. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3749.3799999999997s)]
*  The original colony of Georgia, for example, was founded by James Oglethorpe who originally [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3751.4199999999996s)]
*  intended to use prisoners taken largely from debtors' prisons, creating a debtors' colony [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3754.74s)]
*  where the prisoners could learn trades and work off their debts. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3760.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3762.74s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3763.74s)]
*  There were people over there that were just doing a trade to work off a debt that was [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3765.2999999999997s)]
*  in England. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3768.06s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3769.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3770.06s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3771.06s)]
*  But then the craziest part had to be after the American Revolution or after we won the [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3772.06s)]
*  beat England in the war, that those people were just like, oh, I don't owe anybody anything. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3774.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3780.7799999999997s)]
*  So then they were just free. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3781.7799999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3782.7799999999997s)]
*  They were just there. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3783.7799999999997s)]
*  Huh. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3784.7799999999997s)]
*  That seems like Georgia a little. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3785.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3787.7799999999997s)]
*  I get that vibe, dude. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3788.7799999999997s)]
*  What is something? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3792.4199999999996s)]
*  I like this. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3793.42s)]
*  What is something that... [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3794.42s)]
*  Had you met Laney before you guys got together to make that song? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3797.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3800.82s)]
*  So that tour I was talking about that Morgan brought me on that tour, I said 800 to 2000 [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3802.46s)]
*  people. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3806.58s)]
*  Laney was first of three just acoustic. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3807.58s)]
*  So she was the acoustic opener and then I was second and then Morgan was third. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3810.34s)]
*  And so I met her then. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3815.26s)]
*  Oh, dang. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3816.66s)]
*  And we did. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3817.66s)]
*  That was like 39 shows or something. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3818.66s)]
*  I really got to know her then. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3823.2s)]
*  She was on the first half of that tour and got to really know her then. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3824.7999999999997s)]

*  I heard a story about George Jones, and he got tired of waiting on the wife that he died [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3906.8s)]
*  with. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3912.36s)]

*  But that one time, he wouldn't wait on her, so he went and sat in the car and laid on [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3915.6s)]
*  the horn, and she came out in her underwear and got in the car. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3919.68s)]
*  And he was so fixated on going wherever they were going, he drove all the way down the [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3922.92s)]
*  road and didn't realize... [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3925.76s)]

*  And he went like five miles down the road until he realized that she was going to be [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3933.56s)]
*  there, that she was in her underwear, turned around and came back. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3936.4s)]

*  Like are they like in my mind, it was like, OK, the cops got him and they're like, all [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=3995.84s)]
*  right, go do the drug deal so we can bust the guy like I had. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4000.44s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4003.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, dude, I remember this guy told us one time he's like, yeah, meet me at this [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4004.2400000000002s)]
*  time. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4007.32s)]
*  So we get there as like a huge in the middle of this Kmart parking lot. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4008.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4011.0800000000004s)]
*  So we're like, well, fucking pick a corner. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4012.0800000000004s)]
*  So why them behind it? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4013.92s)]
*  It was just the worst idea. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4015.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4018.7200000000003s)]
*  So we were like, I remember we drove around like just around the middle for a while. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4019.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, I guess we didn't want to go in. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4025.16s)]
*  It was like if we went into the middle, we were in trouble. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4027.64s)]
*  But it was like we were just scoping. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4030.48s)]
*  I'd be less suspicious to just make like a bunch of laps around the parking lot. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4032.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, dude, the worst. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4036.9199999999996s)]
*  I remember one time we got some weed to sell it. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4038.6s)]
*  Right. And it was like we were so excited. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4040.64s)]
*  Right. We get this weed and the second we got it, we're like, oh, we're going to fucking [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4042.64s)]
*  jail. Right. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4046.2s)]
*  So we're so scared. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4048.2s)]
*  We're in the driveway. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4049.68s)]
*  We finally ended up just giving the shit away to a guy down the street, dude, and just ended [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4050.8399999999997s)]
*  up working the payment off to the guy. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4054.44s)]
*  No, seriously. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4057.2799999999997s)]
*  Just freaked out. Yeah. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4058.2799999999997s)]
*  Damn, dude. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4059.64s)]
*  Too annoyed. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4060.72s)]
*  I would have done some shit like that, too, though. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4061.72s)]
*  Too fucking annoyed it out, dude. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4063.44s)]
*  How much was it? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4065.56s)]
*  Was it like a quop or was it like was it like teenager a lot of like an ounce or something? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4067.44s)]
*  No, no, no. I would say it was probably. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4071.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, maybe a QP, I think. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4073.44s)]
*  Yeah. Damn. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4074.8399999999997s)]
*  That was good. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4075.84s)]
*  Damn, dude, gave it away. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4077.6400000000003s)]
*  That was a good day for the guy you gave it to them. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4079.04s)]
*  And maybe he saw that in us, maybe said, oh, these fear babies over here. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4081.96s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking get that. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4085.52s)]
*  Yeah, he might have. Was it a stranger or somebody you knew? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4086.6400000000003s)]
*  Somebody we knew. OK. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4089.28s)]
*  I was fun, though. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4093.44s)]
*  So you get in a tune, you get out here. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4095.48s)]
*  Yeah. How do you get that first hit? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4097.4400000000005s)]
*  You think, dude, it's I've it's a crazy story. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4099.360000000001s)]
*  I got my first publishing deal. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4102.8s)]
*  And what is a publishing deal for people that don't know? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4105.4s)]
*  So it's so if you're just a songwriter in Nashville, you sign there's time. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4107.28s)]
*  If you drive up down Music Road, there's like 50 or probably more publishing companies [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4111.96s)]
*  and they sign songwriters. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4116.08s)]
*  And the point is they pay songwriters a salary to write for that company. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4117.799999999999s)]
*  And they also they have people that work for the company that schedule the rights [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4123.92s)]
*  for the songwriter. They pitch the songs to artists that the songwriters turn in, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4127.719999999999s)]
*  you know, that type of thing. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4132.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, so you get a deal with a publishing house or a publishing company company. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4133.88s)]
*  And then you're kind of like one of their batters in their box. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4139.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  And like, you know, a lot of times I've seen like, you know, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4144.36s)]
*  fucking Joe Blow Nobody signs with a pub deal and then he blows up [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4150.84s)]
*  or signs with a publishing company and then he blows up and has a bunch of hits [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4154.88s)]
*  as a writer. Well, then suddenly that publishing company is on the map [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4158.0s)]
*  because people are going to want to sign there so they can write with this dude. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4161.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? And that's how people that's how Big Loud, you know, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4164.639999999999s)]
*  Big Loud started as a publishing company. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4167.679999999999s)]
*  Craig Wiseman signed like four writers and it was like Rodney Clausen, Sarah [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4170.36s)]
*  Buxton, Chris Tompkins, a few others. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4175.16s)]
*  And they all blew the fuck up. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4178.639999999999s)]
*  And they and so that just boomed Big Loud. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4181.2s)]
*  And then the end with along with Craig, who also is a big hit writer. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4183.5599999999995s)]
*  And so then they were able to really have a legit publishing company [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4187.04s)]
*  and sign a bunch of writers because people wanted to be in that camp [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4191.599999999999s)]
*  because they were the guys writing all the hits. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4194.28s)]
*  OK, so then how does a Big Loud get guys like Morgan and you and Ernest? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4196.28s)]
*  So once they, you know, so they're doing well, people know their name. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4200.0s)]
*  Just as a publishing company. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4204.4s)]
*  And so then Craig Wiseman and I think at that point, Seth England and them [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4205.799999999999s)]
*  decided to start a record label. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4210.759999999999s)]
*  And so that's, you know, when they started Big Loud Records. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4213.48s)]
*  And then they said, well, let's go find an artist to try to develop. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4217.879999999999s)]
*  And then they went and found Chris Lane and they had a hit on Chris Lane. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4221.96s)]
*  And FGL was in that because because they signed FGL to a publishing company. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4226.679999999999s)]
*  But they also manage them. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4231.36s)]
*  But but their record label is a big machine. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4232.639999999999s)]
*  But they had Chris Lane and then, you know, they broke Chris Lane. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4235.04s)]
*  And then they went and they got. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4237.719999999999s)]
*  I don't even know who like the next would have been. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4240.719999999999s)]
*  But anyway, then they found they found Morgan and they just like catch word. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4242.48s)]
*  Like Morgan was on The Voice and then he had, you know, word had gotten out [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4245.48s)]
*  that he had been coming into town and doing stuff. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4248.959999999999s)]
*  And so they were like, let's let's have a meeting with this Morgan Wilding kid. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4250.839999999999s)]
*  And they reach out to Morgan and Morgan plays them a couple of songs. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4253.679999999999s)]
*  They're like, we like your voice. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4256.879999999999s)]
*  Seemed like, you know, we could work well with you. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4258.32s)]
*  They signed into a record. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4260.919999999999s)]
*  You know, it's just it's constantly growing and that whole deal. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4262.799999999999s)]
*  And then guys like you at that point are friends already with Morgan. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4266.44s)]
*  You see that he's there and that excites you guys. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4269.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, like I met Morgan part of it. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4271.16s)]
*  Yeah, yes, exactly. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4273.2s)]
*  And like and especially like Florida, Georgia line and those guys, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4274.599999999999s)]
*  like they were all in that big loud camp. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4279.5199999999995s)]
*  And so that draws people into that. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4281.0s)]
*  And but I met Morgan when the way I talk was like at I think it died at like number 30, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4283.0s)]
*  which is crazy to think about because it's such a still like a big hit for him. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4289.16s)]
*  But it it died at like number 30 at radio. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4292.28s)]
*  And I wrote with him around that time and for the first time. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4294.5599999999995s)]
*  And I was just a big fan of that song and his voice. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4298.32s)]
*  And I was just like, this kid's really good. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4301.679999999999s)]
*  And so he came over to the house. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4303.4s)]
*  I've lived in an apartment over here and we wrote and hit it instantly, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4305.48s)]
*  hit it off and, you know, rest is history. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4309.5599999999995s)]
*  But when I so my publisher to this day, his name is Dennis McCoskey. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4313.12s)]
*  And he grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but his mom. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4318.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, really? From Philadelphia, Mississippi. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4321.84s)]
*  And his mom is my grandfather's aunt. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4324.6s)]
*  So and I knew and so Dennis in the 80s lived in L.A. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4329.72s)]
*  He's my grandfather's aunt. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4333.4s)]
*  So so Dennis and my grandfather are first cousins. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4335.0s)]
*  They shared mom's sisters, you know what I mean? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4338.28s)]
*  And when Dennis Dennis in the 80s was a big hit songwriter in L.A. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4341.0s)]
*  and his claim to fame, he's done a bunch of other amazing things. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4345.56s)]
*  But his biggest claim to fame is he wrote Maniac. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4349.08s)]
*  I'm an 80s. Exactly. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4352.04s)]
*  Yeah. And so growing up, I knew I had this cool cousin [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4353.6s)]
*  that was like a songwriter, but I didn't know. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4358.280000000001s)]
*  Like I knew he lived in Nashville at this point, but I didn't know. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4360.56s)]
*  And he's an older guy. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4363.400000000001s)]
*  He's like late 60s, maybe early 70s. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4364.04s)]
*  And so I was in college. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4367.0s)]
*  I was writing songs, videoing them on my webcam, dude, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4369.88s)]
*  and putting them on like YouTube and sharing them. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4373.04s)]
*  Dude. Yeah. Right. I know. Right. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4375.96s)]
*  And he wrote on my Facebook wall and my Facebook wall, dude. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4379.8s)]
*  And was like, like, you seem like you're doing good. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4383.04s)]
*  Like come by the house. What a bigger pervert. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4385.24s)]
*  Dude, that was that's like back then that this was shit. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4389.56s)]
*  This was like. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4392.4s)]
*  But if a man writes on your baseball, you seem like you're doing good. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4393.32s)]
*  Come by the house. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4396.28s)]
*  To anybody that didn't know the situation, I could see how that would be. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4398.2s)]
*  Yeah. But I went by his house and then he signed me. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4402.96s)]
*  And then I mean, well, it took like years, but but it was a cool thing [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4406.04s)]
*  because like it was a family thing. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4409.64s)]
*  But I didn't really know him. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4411.92s)]
*  And then he reached out. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4413.04s)]
*  And so we've now and now he and I are very close. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4414.12s)]
*  But it felt like it was supposed to happen when some of those other pieces [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4416.32s)]
*  are kind of built in the right. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4418.72s)]
*  It was written in the stars, especially when it's family stuff. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4419.88s)]
*  Yeah. Kind of put those pieces together. Yeah. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4422.6s)]
*  What about? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4427.12s)]
*  What about so tell me a little bit more about that publishing house. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4429.8s)]
*  So how does that work? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4432.08s)]
*  So people get some writers gets onto a publishing house. Right. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4432.8s)]
*  They start writing. Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4436.36s)]
*  And then they're on salary. Yeah. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4438.2s)]
*  But if one of them does well and creates a song, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4440.76s)]
*  then they start to make money from the song. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4443.2s)]
*  Yeah. But only these days, only if the song [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4445.240000000001s)]
*  gets played on the radio. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4449.68s)]
*  So you have what's called mechanical royalties. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4452.6s)]
*  And that is royalties that are paid to the song if it sells copies. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4457.08s)]
*  So like, for instance, like on Morgan's last record, the big record, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4463.240000000001s)]
*  that created a lot of mechanical royalties because it sold really well. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  Right. So but but when you sign your first publishing deal, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4471.64s)]
*  most first publishing deals called a baby deal. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4475.12s)]
*  You you as a writer, you don't get control of your mechanical royalties. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4480.6s)]
*  That goes to the publisher and the publishing company. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4485.0s)]
*  And it's just something that's been around for a long time. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4487.68s)]
*  So so even if you had a song that blew up on TikTok [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4489.92s)]
*  or that sold or streamed like crazy on Apple Music [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4493.240000000001s)]
*  or Spotify or whatever, you wouldn't see any of that money. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4496.639999999999s)]
*  The only way that young songwriters really make money, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4501.2s)]
*  because most of their salaries are like if you sign a first publishing deal, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4504.36s)]
*  it's like 40 grand. That's that's really good. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4508.08s)]
*  Like you're doing really good. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4509.92s)]
*  So it really for a year for usually they're like four, four years, three or four. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4511.24s)]
*  Yeah. So 40 grand over three or four years. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4516.639999999999s)]
*  No, sorry. Yes. 40 grand a year. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4519.16s)]
*  The term is like three or four years. Got it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4522.5199999999995s)]
*  But you only make money if if you have a hit on the radio. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4524.64s)]
*  So like anything, especially for a young writer, top 20 and better, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4527.56s)]
*  is you'll make a life changing amount of money. Right. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4533.240000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4536.280000000001s)]
*  Like is that the one you were talking about earlier? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4537.160000000001s)]
*  Like you make a couple hundred thousand dollars. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4538.280000000001s)]
*  A number one, you will. Wow. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4539.96s)]
*  Depending on how many writers, because if it's split, you know, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4541.64s)]
*  if it's a six way, you're going to make less. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4543.88s)]
*  You're going to make half of what you'd make if it was a three way [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4546.360000000001s)]
*  and that kind of thing. But but yeah. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4548.240000000001s)]
*  So the radio pays out a lot of money. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4551.88s)]
*  And that's where that's where songwriters get paid. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4554.44s)]
*  And that's the PROs, which is paid. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4557.44s)]
*  Wait, what's it? What does it stand for? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4560.48s)]
*  Paid royalty organization. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4561.879999999999s)]
*  Is that right? Yeah, I think so. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4564.4s)]
*  And they they collect money from the radio stations [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4566.44s)]
*  and then they in return pay the writers for having hits on the radio. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4570.44s)]
*  It's tricky, man. It's hard to get a song on the radio. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4576.0s)]
*  Like it's it's a it's so hard. It's I work. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4578.0s)]
*  Well, you know, one of my jobs that I had, I was a tour manager [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4581.28s)]
*  for Josh Kelly, who ever told you that or not? Really? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4584.24s)]
*  Yeah. George Clay. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4587.88s)]
*  Just like that George Clay. Yeah. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4590.599999999999s)]
*  Was it that time? Baby, you're amazing. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4592.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Josh's man. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4596.8s)]
*  I didn't know that you T.M. him. Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4598.96s)]
*  When was that? We went around the whole country, dude. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4601.12s)]
*  We would go to all the radio stations and I would go in in the morning [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4603.76s)]
*  and be like, done it again. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4606.599999999999s)]
*  Just can't leave. Yeah. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4608.48s)]
*  You know, I get the coffee and the donuts and, you know, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4610.0s)]
*  get people fired up and stuff. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4612.68s)]

*  Oh, there remember that you see this thing you're trying to make it. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4717.0s)]
*  So in Tennessee, you couldn't. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4720.12s)]
*  Couldn't they don't want people performing. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4722.24s)]

*  drag performances in public and in front of children. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4735.8s)]
*  So they want to stop, I guess, like drag perform. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4738.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't want performances that could influence, I guess, a child's sexuality, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4741.12s)]
*  maybe, or. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4746.4s)]
*  But then this is the governor, right? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4748.639999999999s)]

*  Like if you're taking your child to something. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=4774.28s)]

*  They didn't know what a lot of people had never seen a man nurse. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5502.88s)]

*  Right. It was just part of the practice. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5513.88s)]

*  Yeah, because you see a lot of Latino male nurses that have like families and stuff. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5518.96s)]
*  But I think in the beginning, yeah, it was like it was like I think a lot of men used to want to have kind of women jobs kind of, you know, I think if they were I think a lot of gay men because I think here's probably why is because they probably weren't accepted in a lot of male jobs. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5523.36s)]
*  Yeah, sure. You know, maybe people made them feel like they weren't capable, like a maid, a maid, like a man made. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5537.56s)]

*  Did you do something? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5792.96s)]
*  I did at the venue that I met her at a specific spot in this venue [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5794.16s)]
*  called The Lyric in Oxford. OK. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5798.92s)]

*  But I faked that I had a private show at this venue [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5806.12s)]
*  on a Sunday after our Atlanta show on Saturday. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=5809.44s)]

*  So everybody's going to have like cowboy hats and shit. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6012.08s)]

*  Like completely different, you know, than what she thought. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6019.04s)]
*  But especially at Ole Miss, I don't think you get the cowboy hat at Ole Miss. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6022.04s)]
*  No, no, that's a Mississippi state. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6025.360000000001s)]

*  Ben, was there anything else in the news that we wanted to look at? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6038.96s)]
*  I'm trying to think of anything else that was cool. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6041.52s)]
*  Oh, dude, what? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6045.2s)]
*  Let me see people. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6046.92s)]
*  Yeah, it says the average penis length is growing, according to a new study. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6048.76s)]
*  The study was led by Michael Eisenberg, a urology professor at Stanford Medicine [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6054.44s)]
*  and sexual function specialist. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6060.04s)]
*  The compiled data from over 75 studies done between 1942 and 2021. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6061.84s)]
*  Damn, he's been just looking at a lot of wean, huh? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6067.92s)]
*  Gathered measurements of the erect penises of over 55,000 men. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6074.4s)]
*  God, this dude's probably in the damn closet. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6079.44s)]
*  If he's got a wife, she needs to damn knock on the door sometimes [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6082.04s)]
*  and see what's going on in there. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6084.84s)]
*  55,000 men and erect, dude. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6086.4s)]
*  Yeah, there's no way you could look at this many. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6089.16s)]
*  I don't want to bring up a picture of the guy, but are we sure he's not just... [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6092.04s)]
*  The findings were astounding is what he says, dude. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6095.719999999999s)]
*  Let me see zoom in on... [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6099.799999999999s)]

*  Oh, no, he just looks like a dude who would look at some penises. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6103.839999999999s)]
*  1942 though? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6106.16s)]
*  Oh, that's when the study, that's when he's been looking at them from then. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6108.36s)]
*  Oh, OK, so he's just been looking at pictures? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6110.759999999999s)]
*  From then, yeah. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6113.5599999999995s)]
*  How do you even find a picture of an erect penis from 1942? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6114.88s)]
*  Oh, I think you can get that pretty easily. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6119.2s)]
*  I think it's some of the rest of the... [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6121.0s)]
*  It's like just putting them all in a stack or whatever. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6122.24s)]
*  How many is... [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6125.04s)]
*  Go back to the information, please, brother. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6125.92s)]
*  Let me see the findings were astounding. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6129.400000000001s)]
*  Penis length also showed variation by... [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6130.56s)]
*  Go down. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6132.6s)]
*  Let's get into some information. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6134.68s)]
*  Oh, it locked up, great. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6138.04s)]
*  You know what's becoming interesting? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6140.12s)]
*  You have to pay for news now. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6141.0s)]
*  You notice that? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6142.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6143.24s)]
*  So then over time, whatever information is going to be only available to people with money. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6144.6s)]
*  Damn, that's wild. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6154.12s)]
*  It's going to get weird. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6155.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you get, you read, I've noticed that. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6155.88s)]
*  Like I'll see a clickbait thing and you'll read like the... [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6157.56s)]
*  The just enough and then it's like for the rest, like subscribe to Huffington Post or whatever it is. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6160.92s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6167.400000000001s)]
*  Can we get any more? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6168.52s)]
*  Eisenberg told Stanford... [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6169.240000000001s)]
*  Showed variation by... [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6170.400000000001s)]
*  We all knew that already. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6171.320000000001s)]
*  By geographic region? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6172.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a given, right? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6173.88s)]
*  I think so. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6175.88s)]
*  In the article, Eisenberg said, chemical exposure could be interacting with our hormone makeup, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6177.56s)]
*  which could be one of the many reasons that biological change is occurring. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6182.68s)]
*  Oh, maybe people are living in a place where there's more plastics in the water. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6186.32s)]
*  Or could it be like, I've heard like kids, like a 13 year old boy or girl today looks like a grownup, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6190.28s)]
*  like has the, is built like a grownup compared to like in the 30s, 40s, 50s or whatever, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6198.0s)]
*  because of like hormones in the food or something like that. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6205.28s)]
*  That's crazy, dude. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6207.96s)]
*  It's weird what we're going to end up as. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6209.04s)]
*  We're going to end up like chickens in your dad's thing. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6211.4s)]
*  Yeah, we probably kind of already are, you know? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6213.4s)]
*  It feels like it doesn't it sometimes? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6216.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6217.8s)]
*  You know, it feels like we all know the same information and are kind of like watching this, you know, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6218.92s)]
*  it's like we all get the same six news stories every day. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6222.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6226.0s)]
*  We're all kind of like stuck in the same thing. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6226.599999999999s)]
*  What about that train thing? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6228.639999999999s)]
*  Are you keeping up with that? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6230.08s)]
*  That Ohio derailment? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6231.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6232.12s)]
*  I'm supposed to make it here, but I don't. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6232.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, that cloud is coming here? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6234.92s)]
*  Or something. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6236.719999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6237.28s)]
*  In the water. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6237.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I'm going to get a hot air balloon and go up and get a hit. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6238.2s)]
*  Cause if that shit comes over here, you might grow a fucking tail or something. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6240.4s)]
*  If you do that, dude, like a third arm or something. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6244.44s)]
*  Dude, I'll take it, bro. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p9kYt6L0&t=6248.5199999999995s)]
