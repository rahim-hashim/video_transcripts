*  in comedy, Mr. Burt Chrysler. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  I love the stuff. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=101.04s)]
*  So like I don't know the benefit. You know like Tim Dillon, what's he is right? Maybe the best [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=108.56s)]
*  podcaster we have of our generation. You and Tim Dillon are probably the two best podcasters I know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=114.0s)]
*  that I enjoy watching. I love Rogan. Rogan's obviously the king. I love watching Rogan but [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=118.0s)]
*  I love watching you and Tim the way you guys think. Now price point wise right? Say there's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=125.04s)]
*  let's talk about these companies that come in they go we're doing it right. We spent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=129.76s)]
*  $50,000 on cameras. We spent $100,000 on microphones. We got state of the art board. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=135.44s)]

*  But I do think that if you I do think here's what I learned from Rogan. If you invest a little more [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  money in it you care more and if you care more you get a better product. I think that that's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=150.48s)]
*  probably true and I think guests come and they see that you care more. Yeah. It feels more eloquent. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=156.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah it's one of the reasons like sometimes it's like I would like to get into like a nicer [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=162.16s)]

*  fucking eight years and so people are like do you live here? And you're like okay. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3BSefWPoQ&t=182.4s)]
