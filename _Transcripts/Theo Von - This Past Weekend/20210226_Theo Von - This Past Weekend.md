*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  He called out that gay, the other gentleman who he got an argument with, Larry Tunsel or [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  whatever. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=389.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=391.92s)]
*  He got in trouble for bullying, I think. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=392.92s)]
*  But he's always been a tough guy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=393.92s)]
*  Which you should do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=394.92s)]
*  If your job is being this guy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=396.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Now he's so big though. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  Like I, is that Caltrilly's son, dude? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=401.2s)]
*  Wait, go to that, that picture right there where he's got that Bill's hat on right there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=403.68s)]
*  Look at how, look at how just thick he is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=409.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=411.72s)]

*  He's a, he's a blonde silverback. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=413.72s)]
*  I couldn't put my, he, he, I couldn't put my hand. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=415.76s)]
*  So when I shook his hand, my hand didn't reach all the way around his palm. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=418.72s)]
*  So his palm, his two of mine. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=422.92s)]
*  It was so weird. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  And then he'd go both hands on his hand like that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  I had to go, yeah, I had to go, I had to go like this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=428.84s)]
*  Use one hand as your knuckles and one hand as your hand. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=431.4s)]
*  I said, how much did you squat? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=434.08s)]
*  How much did you squat? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=435.56s)]
*  He goes, well, I mean, I used to, when I was going crazy, you know, probably, I don't know, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=436.56s)]

*  There's absolutely no reason. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=667.8s)]
*  But I would go back to my boxing gym and use just some of the shit he taught me. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=669.3199999999999s)]

*  But anybody who fights Sanhagen, if I had to put my money on the future champion, I [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=695.96s)]
*  got to be honest, it's Sanhagen. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=700.4399999999999s)]

*  He doesn't take a lot of punishment, number one. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=714.8s)]
*  And he's just on the move so much. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=716.64s)]
*  And he's also 5'11", 5'10", 11". [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=718.24s)]

*  Let's get back into that, man. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=831.6s)]
*  So first I want to know physically, how do you age gracefully? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=832.72s)]

*  Okay. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=838.72s)]
*  So, but the problem with that is that people who I don't sleep well, are you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=839.1999999999999s)]

*  Now, what if you have a couple of good die of a chocolates? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=848.8s)]
*  It depends, but as you get older, you're going to have more and more of a problem. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=851.84s)]
*  As you get older, you, you could, when I was younger, I could drink a bottle [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=855.6s)]
*  of wine, red wine, no problem. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=858.24s)]
*  I had energy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=859.84s)]
*  I had energy. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=861.52s)]

*  And was it in like one of those? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=862.24s)]
*  Can you bring up a cask of red wine, please? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=863.12s)]
*  I just want to know. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=866.0s)]
*  I drank it from a cask. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=866.64s)]
*  Did you actually, actually you drink it from a, from a, from a leather bladder. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=868.08s)]
*  That's what I was asked from an old school flat. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=871.44s)]
*  I've heard stories of, uh, yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=873.92s)]
*  Can we get an image of a cask of red wine? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a cask. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=880.48s)]
*  I think it's a wine cask. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=881.76s)]
*  See that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=884.08s)]
*  You know what? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=884.72s)]
*  I was looking for more. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=885.12s)]
*  I was looking more for the, an old timey old cask is what you transported in. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=885.92s)]
*  Maybe you're just, you store it in or you, you age it in, but, but, uh, a flask, you [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  use a leather, a leather flask. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=897.52s)]
*  You know, I'm thinking via more like that bladder, that more like that, that would [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=901.04s)]
*  probably change the taste of the wine. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=904.8s)]
*  You see, you understand. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  So you need, what you need is you need a glass bottle. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  You age it under preferably 55 degrees. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=911.76s)]
*  Bitch wants to pull out a glass bottle with his buddies. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=914.88s)]
*  You guys are all on a mountainside relaxing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=918.16s)]
*  The women are, you know, if they want to do it or doing washing down by the creek. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=920.88s)]
*  Or collecting berries or yes, if it's a traditional, if it's a traditional hike, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=926.32s)]
*  they're gathering and you guys are hunting. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=931.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=933.04s)]
*  I mean, I, right. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=933.36s)]
*  Everybody's playing there. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=934.0s)]
*  Everybody's doing, helping out. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=934.8s)]
*  And there's a room for the other person. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=935.92s)]
*  There are other genders that might be represented there who might do both. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=937.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=940.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=941.28s)]
*  Or who might choose. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=941.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=943.36s)]
*  To do. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=943.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=944.0s)]
*  Maybe one day the biggest hunters like, oh, I'm going to go hunt berries. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=944.56s)]
*  You know, that's right. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=947.28s)]
*  Whoa, that's right. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  Calm down a lot. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=950.56s)]
*  We need your back up here, dog. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=952.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=955.52s)]
*  But you say, okay, so sleep. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=955.68s)]
*  Water. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=958.0s)]
*  And then I think I actually believe in. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=958.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, do you do water before you go to sleep? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=962.88s)]
*  Sometimes, but I think more importantly is in the morning. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=965.52s)]
*  And then what I think is important is not eating too much, never overloading your system. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  Never. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=973.1199999999999s)]
*  So if you, I do think intermittent fasting is a really good idea. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=973.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=977.36s)]
*  And I think eating simply and not overloading your body, you can feel it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=977.84s)]
*  Dude, I've done, I haven't done intermittent fasting, but I've had mittens on before and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=982.08s)]
*  it's so hard to fucking eat with mittens on. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=985.12s)]
*  And that's the same goddamn thing. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=986.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=988.16s)]
*  How are you supposed to butter your toast with mittens? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=988.56s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=991.52s)]
*  And then you're spitting out whoop, whoop, damn it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=992.16s)]
*  And it's like, at least they're wool though. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=995.6s)]
*  And why do you wear wool when you, why do you wear wool when you're hunting? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=997.04s)]
*  Because you are trying to attract animals. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1000.48s)]
*  No. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1002.64s)]
*  Because you need. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1003.44s)]
*  Why would you wear wool instead of cotton? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  I would wear wool instead of cotton because wool is warmer. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1006.88s)]
*  Well, it is, especially when? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  When it is nighttime. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1014.24s)]
*  When it gets wet. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1015.6s)]
*  When it gets wet. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1016.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1017.12s)]
*  So wool gets wet better. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1017.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  If you, cotton kills. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1020.08s)]
*  If you get wet in cotton, you're gonna die. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  You get wet in wool, wool will actually keep you warm. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1025.52s)]
*  It's, it acts like almost like an insulating, like a, like a, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1029.84s)]
*  it's almost like a wet suit. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1033.12s)]
*  So you'll stay alive longer in wool. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1035.6s)]
*  You don't want to be wet period, but wool, wool. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1037.84s)]
*  So that's why your first two layers when you go hunting or in the wilderness is always wool. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1040.32s)]
*  You don't, you can use polyester maybe, but you want wool. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1044.96s)]
*  I don't want to do, I want to do, if I'm going outside, I like to have on wool socks. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1050.56s)]
*  Actually, if I'm on a long distance flight, I'll even wear wool socks. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1055.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1057.92s)]
*  That's where I'm at age-wise. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1058.56s)]
*  I got all kinds of things, but I'm terrified of the cold. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1059.84s)]
*  I'm afraid of the cold. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1062.16s)]
*  Cold makes me a coward. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  So I always have warm shit in my car, including fire making material. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1069.0400000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  So does that, so I guess I do, but not really. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1070.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, if I can, you know, you live in Venice. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  So it's kind of like. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1076.72s)]
*  In case Venice goes to the- [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1077.92s)]
*  There's enough homeless who's making fires over there. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1078.96s)]
*  I know, but in case it goes to the wolves, maybe the vegetation. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1081.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  There's a virus and vegetation gets crazy and now we're in [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1084.88s)]
*  this tropical jungle because of global warming and now I got to make a fire. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  Here's a question right here, man, from Peter, Peter Rion, son. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1091.28s)]
*  Hey, Peter, take your hood off. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  Damn kid. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  What's up, Brian? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1097.6s)]
*  What's up, Theo? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1098.56s)]
*  Coming here from Los Angeles. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1099.84s)]
*  I ran into Brian about two years ago in Venice. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1102.48s)]
*  It was too much of a bitch to say what's up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1105.6s)]
*  My biggest regret in life, pretty much. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1108.72s)]
*  But speaking of Venice- [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  I didn't see you. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1112.56s)]
*  I would have said hi. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1113.2s)]
*  Brian, you can talk about- [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1114.24s)]
*  No, he said he was a bitch for not saying hi to you. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1115.36s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1117.36s)]
*  But I respect the fact you thought he called it that you were the bitch. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1118.16s)]
*  I always say hi. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1120.56s)]

*  Amen, brother. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1127.76s)]

*  You have any experience with that? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe some tips on how to navigate the waters and just get your workout in. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1133.52s)]
*  True alpha like Brian would know. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1142.08s)]
*  And he was talking about specifically the Venice Golds. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1142.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1145.6s)]
*  Well, I'm very, very appreciative of that question because I was working out in the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1146.08s)]
*  Golds in Hollywood when I was a young man. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1150.16s)]
*  And I was cute. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1152.4s)]
*  When I was a young man, I knew I was getting older because gay men stopped looking at me. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1152.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1155.68s)]
*  Now when I was younger- [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1156.48s)]
*  They just give you money at that point. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1157.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1159.04s)]
*  When I was younger, I was skinny, but I had a pretty face. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1159.36s)]
*  I had a pretty, I had a delicate nose. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1161.84s)]
*  And my jaw was well defined. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1163.44s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1166.72s)]
*  Write this down, man. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1167.28s)]
*  I had heavy eyelids. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1168.4s)]
*  I had not heavy eyelids, but you could see the- [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1169.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1171.84s)]
*  You could see the meat on your eyes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1172.24s)]
*  Even though I just had my lids, it doesn't work. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1172.8s)]
*  So I was cute. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1174.8s)]
*  And I was doing these. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1176.56s)]
*  I never liked lifting weights. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1179.2s)]
*  I was just like, whatever, but I'm there and I'm doing everything wrong. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1180.4s)]
*  Those are unique too. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1182.4s)]
*  Those are those kind of like, I'm a kangaroo. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1183.52s)]
*  Look at me. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's for your triceps. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1186.16s)]
*  I never could do, I hated working out where I was just doing curls. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1188.16s)]
*  I was like, I can't do it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1191.92s)]
*  I want to do something where I feel like I'm becoming more athletic, not looking like a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1193.52s)]
*  bodybuilder. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1199.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1199.92s)]
*  So I'm doing this stupid bodybuilding thing and a guy gets behind me. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1200.72s)]
*  He gets behind me because doing it wrong. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1205.44s)]
*  A white guy? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1208.0800000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1208.96s)]
*  He goes, you're doing it wrong. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1209.44s)]
*  What's up? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1210.88s)]
*  And he goes, get your butt in there. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  And he kicks my knee and he grabs my elbows. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1213.04s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck is going on here, man. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1216.8s)]
*  So we just went with it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1220.16s)]
*  We dated for like three years. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1221.28s)]
*  And I know. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1222.56s)]
*  And then I was like, I'm straight. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1223.68s)]
*  And I ran out. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  I was like, I can't do this anymore. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1225.92s)]
*  But you get confused. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1227.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1229.68s)]
*  So the answer to that question is sometimes you can get like, what the fuck? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1230.16s)]
*  And you're living with each other. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1234.0s)]
*  You have two small dogs. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1234.96s)]
*  You have a vegetable garden. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1235.92s)]
*  You're like, I'm not gay. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1236.88s)]
*  But it can take a while. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1238.24s)]
*  It can take a while. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1239.36s)]
*  It's comfortable. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1240.16s)]
*  They can get comfortable when you're shacked up with a man. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1240.72s)]
*  They lull you in with the wind chime. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1243.2s)]
*  You go to their house and there's wind chimes. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1245.36s)]
*  And some of the wind chimes, it's other young men screaming for help when the wind hits the pipe. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1247.44s)]
*  I've been attracted to, there's a guy yesterday. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1256.8s)]
*  It's crazy, bro. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1262.56s)]
*  Like, where did you get that wind chime, dude? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1263.6s)]
*  And why does each chime have a person's name written on it? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1266.88s)]
*  Do you have somebody somewhere in this house? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1269.6000000000001s)]
*  Is there somebody under the floorboards? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1272.0800000000002s)]
*  That's Edgar Allan Poe, man. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1276.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it is Edgar Allan Poe. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1278.0s)]
*  Telltale heart, dog. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1279.2800000000002s)]
*  God damn right, bro. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1280.0s)]
*  Hey, you ordered in the floorboards, dog. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1281.0400000000002s)]
*  So sleep and water helps. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1284.48s)]
*  But yeah, to get back to this man's question, sorry. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1287.0400000000002s)]
*  A lot of men, and look, one thing that's not discussed a lot of times in America is [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1290.24s)]
*  the aggression of, it's always looked at that men, straight men are the predators in America. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1295.68s)]
*  There is also predatorial behavior by gay men. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1302.72s)]
*  And it is unchecked. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1306.64s)]
*  There's nobody monitoring it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1308.88s)]
*  There's nobody... [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's guy on guy crime, so guys are... [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1313.04s)]
*  Right, but you see how, I think you can quickly see how women are [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1315.3600000000001s)]
*  disgruntled by the behavior of men sometimes by men flirting with them [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1321.92s)]
*  because it happens so aggressively with men. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1326.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's very true. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1331.52s)]
*  If you go to the supermarket at Whole Foods and you're a good looking woman, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1336.48s)]
*  you know you're going to be dealing with energy. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1339.2s)]
*  It's almost like being a celebrity where you know all those people want to talk to you [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1344.24s)]
*  and they're going to. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1348.0s)]
*  Something's going to happen. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1349.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1350.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1350.56s)]
*  First of all, you're aware of how you look because you have to be, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1353.52s)]
*  because they're staring at you. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1355.76s)]
*  You know they're going to look for an excuse to talk to you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1357.12s)]
*  You know they're going to try to stop you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1359.36s)]
*  It's all that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1361.6s)]
*  It's like being on a decent podcast. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1362.32s)]
*  It's like being on a decent podcast. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  It really is. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1366.3999999999999s)]
*  I love your podcast, bro, and then they want to take. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1367.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1369.04s)]
*  God bless. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1369.52s)]
*  But it's different for women. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1370.24s)]
*  For guys, it's like, ah, they like me, but for women it's... [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1372.0s)]
*  But for women, yeah, there's more of a... [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1374.8s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1376.32s)]
*  I bet it's exhausting. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1377.2s)]
*  But then you also get dangerous like guys who follow you and shit. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1377.76s)]
*  There's always that danger, I think, for women where men don't have to deal with that. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1381.2s)]
*  It's just different. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1386.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1387.36s)]
*  If a dude follows you back to your place, you can be like, hey, dude, what are you doing in my place? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1387.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1391.2s)]
*  Whereas women, it's more like, yeah, it's got to be, it's probably a lot scarier. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1391.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1395.12s)]
*  But it's getting... [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1395.76s)]
*  If a guy follows you back to your place, you know, as a guy, you can be like, well, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1396.8s)]
*  make sure you close the door, whatever it is. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1399.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1401.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1402.4s)]
*  Can I get you a drink? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1402.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1404.64s)]
*  Can I get you a... [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1405.12s)]
*  But wait, so aging gracefully, is that what we're talking about? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1405.84s)]
*  Oh, no, you were trying to answer his question. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1410.0s)]
*  I was trying to answer this guy's question because I feel like this doesn't get talked [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1411.12s)]
*  about enough that there is mans that will do anything to be gay with you. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1414.9599999999998s)]
*  And a attractive... [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1422.8s)]
*  Here's what I realized the other day. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1425.36s)]
*  The hottest guy that a gay male can get is a straight male. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  I've heard that from other gay men. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1433.2s)]
*  No, the hottest girl, that's their hottest girl. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1434.32s)]
*  Like our hottest girl is like a hot girl. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like, I got to get a hot girl. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1437.68s)]
*  The hottest girl for a gay man is a straight guy. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1439.52s)]
*  That's their hottest girl. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1443.44s)]
*  Mm. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1444.64s)]
*  Turning a straight guy. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1446.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1446.8s)]
*  And like, people were like, yeah, it's like, first of all, the term turning a guy straight [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1447.44s)]
*  sounds... [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1454.16s)]
*  There's a physical fucking element to it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1455.92s)]
*  It sounds like a fucking crazy guy. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1458.32s)]
*  It sounds like a fucking crime. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1461.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1463.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1464.9599999999998s)]
*  It's still a guy. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  I've seen women... [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1467.6s)]
*  There was a guy yesterday I saw who was a host of... [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  He was like, seating people. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1472.9599999999998s)]
*  And he was tall. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1475.12s)]
*  He was dressed so well and he was so effeminate. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1477.28s)]
*  He smelled so good. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1480.3999999999999s)]
*  And he had short blonde hair. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1482.0s)]
*  And he was just like... [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1483.52s)]
*  He was perfect and he had really delicate features. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  He was beautiful. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  He looked like a beautiful... [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1488.08s)]
*  He was so androgynous. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1490.0s)]
*  Like a little... [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1491.6000000000001s)]
*  Like a... [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1492.24s)]
*  And he was super nice. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1492.96s)]
*  And he had a kind of a very non-threatening voice. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1494.4s)]
*  And I was looking at him and I was like, I'm definitely... [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm drawn to this... [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1500.64s)]
*  This might be a man, but he's got so much feminine energy. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1502.3200000000002s)]
*  That's Rome. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1506.3200000000002s)]
*  That's that Roman vibe. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1506.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1507.92s)]
*  That you're like... [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1508.3200000000002s)]
*  It wasn't that I wanted to have sex with him, but I appreciated how beautiful he was as a creature. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1510.16s)]
*  I'd feed him olives. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1515.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1516.16s)]
*  I didn't even know... [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1516.8s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going to call him a guy or a girl. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  This is where the gender fluid thing makes sense. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1518.96s)]
*  And that's where we're headed, I feel like. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1521.52s)]
*  Well, I have a theory on all of it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1523.3600000000001s)]
*  Like right now, we're trying to deal with this non-duality, right? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1525.92s)]
*  So you know the idea behind... [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1528.64s)]
*  So a lot of this gender stuff comes from Jacques Derrida, who talked about... [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1530.8s)]
*  So when you have a dualistic mind, most of us have a dualistic mind. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1535.76s)]
*  I do probably. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1539.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1539.92s)]
*  Male, female. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1540.56s)]
*  Male, female. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1542.16s)]
*  Reason, passion. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1542.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, I have all that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1545.2s)]
*  Logic, superstition. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1546.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1547.8400000000001s)]
*  We break the world up into two. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1548.96s)]
*  Male, female. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1550.72s)]
*  Yin and yang. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1551.76s)]
*  Hot and cold. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1552.64s)]
*  And what Derrida said... [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1553.92s)]
*  I think Derrida was the biggest mental masturbator of all time, but what he said was... [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1555.1200000000001s)]
*  He said, if you have a dualistic sense of mind, you automatically privilege one over the other. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1560.48s)]
*  You automatically are going to privilege male over female, maybe hot over... [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1567.04s)]
*  There's a tendency to privilege... [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1571.2s)]
*  So reason over passion. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1573.76s)]
*  Be reasonable. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1576.88s)]
*  Be logical. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1577.6s)]
*  Don't be superstitious. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1578.24s)]
*  When we have this... [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1579.4399999999998s)]
*  The mind over the heart. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1581.9199999999998s)]
*  That's always the battle. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1585.28s)]
*  The mind or the spirit over the flesh. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  So we think dualistically. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1588.8799999999999s)]
*  And so the idea is when you do that, you're going to always favor one... [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  We construct as human beings maps of meaning, and you're going to always favor one over the other. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1595.9199999999998s)]
*  And when you do that, automatically... [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1602.0s)]
*  If that's your language structure, there's going to be built-in prejudice. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  There's going to be a built-in power structure. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1610.24s)]
*  You understand? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  And so the idea behind a non-dualistic way of thinking, the idea behind going beyond male and female, for example, and gender, is the idea that that's how you... [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1613.3600000000001s)]
*  Beyond going black and white, the idea is racist, non-racist, how about anti-race? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1626.5600000000002s)]
*  The idea is that you will sort of not favor one over the other. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1632.1599999999999s)]
*  And maybe there's value in favoring the one that you usually don't favor over the other. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1637.84s)]
*  You got to switch it up so you fuck with your brain. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1642.8s)]
*  So that you fuck with the entire power structure. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1645.1999999999998s)]
*  That would be the idea behind... [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1648.1599999999999s)]
*  That's what's coming on in the universities. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1649.28s)]
*  That's what's going on in the humanities. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what Jordan Peterson talks about. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1652.1599999999999s)]
*  That's why you have this huge fight with gender now. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1653.52s)]
*  So now you have... [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1658.08s)]
*  It's very interesting because the feminists are having a big problem with the transgender community. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  Because for a lot of feminists, they're going, wait, you're saying you're a man, you're a biological man, but you're saying you identify as a woman. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1665.9199999999998s)]
*  And so now you're trying to be on equal footing with women. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1673.36s)]
*  Meaning, for example, you should be able to compete in women's sports. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1677.04s)]
*  Which means women who are biological get their scholarships taken away because you might be physically just more advantaged. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1680.9599999999998s)]
*  So it's very interesting to see how the feminist movement is grating up against the trans movement. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1687.68s)]
*  It's becoming this whole crazy debate. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1692.64s)]
*  It's becoming the fucking WNBA, dude. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1695.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  You can't even guess me. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  But it all comes from a philosophy, a French philosophy. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1698.56s)]
*  It comes from Foucault, it comes from Derrida. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1701.76s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the fathers of these kinds of thoughts, it's very interesting. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1704.24s)]
*  So you're saying that because we got stuck in this old idea of black or white, male or female, that now things, it's starting to become, the picture is becoming muddier, but we're still kind of chained to some of these old ways? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1708.48s)]
*  We are, because that's the way our brains work. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1724.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1727.28s)]
*  And I don't know if some of it's evolutionary or biological. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  I would imagine a lot of it's evolutionary. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1730.24s)]
*  Right, a lot of it is evolutionary. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1731.76s)]
*  A lot of it is like us, because yeah, a lot of the things I hear and read these some days, it's like, this just, this sounds cool. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1734.08s)]
*  It's a neat idea, but it's not going to flow, actually flow through the system that I am made of. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  But when you get to the level of detail, it's really hard to implement. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1747.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1750.3999999999999s)]
*  But I have to say that, like, as somebody who felt very uneasy about all this woke shit, I will say this. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1750.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, I do, I know that if you watch commercials now, it's always like, it's always a mixed couple. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1758.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1763.4399999999998s)]
*  So it's like a black man with a white woman, a white woman with a black man. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1763.68s)]
*  And so there's this forced sort of diversity inclusion thing. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1767.6000000000001s)]
*  But what I like about that, in a way, is that it is, kids are growing up with the idea that that's the normal. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1773.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1781.28s)]
*  It used to be with my generation, if a black and a white person got married, it was always like, you're like. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1781.68s)]
*  Oh, you call them zebras. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1787.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1788.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  And now it's like what the left wants to do. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1789.36s)]
*  And I understand it is kind of try to erase all that from your mind. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  Don't see color and don't even see gender. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1797.04s)]
*  Because if you make it an issue, the problem is when you try to do that, you're actually making an issue. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1798.9599999999998s)]
*  So that's the trap that you have to get out of. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1802.9599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know how to get out of that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1804.8s)]
*  But I do appreciate, I will say that in a lot of ways, a lot of this woke shit is made. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1806.08s)]
*  So if you're trans, if you're a child and you do have this gender thing going on, like you're a man, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1812.8s)]
*  but you feel like a woman, I really do believe that's a biological thing. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1818.88s)]
*  I do believe that there are some people that just are born that way. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1822.24s)]
*  They're born into a male body. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1825.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're born to a male body, but they feel like a woman. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1827.44s)]
*  There's so many people. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1829.6000000000001s)]
*  Dude, I used to do it when that Shania Twain song would come on, if I'm real honest with you. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1830.8000000000002s)]
*  I would be honest, I would close my door and do the damn. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1835.5200000000002s)]
*  Well, we all have. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1837.92s)]
*  Put on the floor. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1838.96s)]
*  We all, you know, there's all spectrum. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1839.5200000000002s)]
*  Some people are more feminine, more masculine. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1842.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1845.0400000000002s)]
*  And we certainly get caged into what is expected. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1845.36s)]
*  There's a lot of conditioning in the world for sure. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1850.08s)]
*  Like this is the way I'm supposed to be. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think it's a lot to piece apart. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1855.12s)]
*  It is. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1862.32s)]
*  But I think that what I think is technology and gene editing and meshing with computers, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1863.36s)]
*  if you read the Singularity is Near, you know, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1871.6s)]
*  human beings are going to start being able to not only control their own biology, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1875.0400000000002s)]
*  their own evolution, but they might be able to control even their own. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1879.44s)]
*  I don't know if it's sex, but the idea of transforming into what you actually want to be [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1886.5600000000002s)]
*  through gene editing as an adult is not far. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1892.4s)]
*  It's not far fetched. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1896.4s)]
*  It just isn't. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1897.76s)]
*  You will be able to eventually. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1898.72s)]
*  Right now, the process of turning into a woman is crude. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1900.8000000000002s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1904.08s)]
*  It requires a great deal of surgery and things like that. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1905.36s)]
*  Stirrups. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1908.6399999999999s)]
*  All that stuff. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1909.76s)]
*  I think eventually what's going to happen is when we have the technology. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1910.56s)]
*  You think it would be a juxtaposition of genes in real time? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, to genetically, you know, you will be able to genetically morph into the female, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1916.72s)]
*  the biological version of yourself as a female. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1923.12s)]
*  And that's not at all unscientific. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1928.0s)]
*  Now, now we are already going to be at how would we talk about gender now? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1931.12s)]
*  So a lot of this is almost like this. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1936.3999999999999s)]
*  I always try to look at these big trends as evolutionarily. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1938.8s)]
*  It's like it's just there's an evolution to it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1942.2399999999998s)]
*  There is. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1944.4799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1945.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, sometimes it's hard to like with with media and like them pushing people certain ways, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1945.36s)]
*  it's hard to sometimes know what is like just where things are going and what is like, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1950.3999999999999s)]
*  okay, lead the people trying to lead you over there for like commercial value, you know? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1955.6799999999998s)]
*  Like that's a hard thing to notice sometimes. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I think as like I can't imagine if you could press a button or take a tonic or something. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1962.88s)]
*  And over like a week period, you'd be like, yeah, I'm fucking yeah, I'm doing drywall right now. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1969.92s)]
*  But in a week, I'm going to be a fucking at least an aide in Florida, you know, a female aide. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1976.08s)]
*  And you would say you would be. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1980.64s)]
*  And then you see your buddies down there who's doing drywall. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1983.52s)]
*  He's down there because you got a different job. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1985.92s)]
*  He got relocated. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1987.52s)]
*  And you guys just see each other in an elevator. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1988.72s)]
*  Yeah, but that's already happened. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1990.56s)]
*  But now it requires a great deal of surgery. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1992.6399999999999s)]
*  It's very rudimentary, they call it. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1994.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's physical and rudimentary. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1996.56s)]
*  I mean, it's a real hacksaw. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  Jim Duggan in there. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2000.1599999999999s)]
*  You basically. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2001.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2002.08s)]
*  Look, and then here you go right here. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2002.56s)]
*  Now, this this guy. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2003.9199999999998s)]
*  This is Gabrielle Ludwig. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2006.6399999999999s)]
*  It recently went viral. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2008.56s)]
*  People try to say this is just happening. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2009.84s)]
*  She's playing for Santa Clara Community College, but it was actually from 2012. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2011.76s)]
*  But she was a former Navy SEAL. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2016.56s)]
*  Come on. Yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2018.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2019.6s)]
*  Yeah. USA Today profiled her struggles of being on this team. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  But again, back in 2012, she's already a one percenter when it comes to men biologically. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2023.36s)]
*  Right. She's six three or six four. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2029.36s)]
*  Eight. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2031.28s)]
*  Six eight. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2031.9199999999998s)]
*  And she was a SEAL. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2032.56s)]
*  Six eight is too tall for a SEAL, I think. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2034.0s)]
*  Right. And so there's these other girls like. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2035.9199999999998s)]
*  Cardinal and naval tattoos. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2037.84s)]
*  First of all, she could. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2039.9199999999998s)]
*  Ex-Navy soldier, not SEAL. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2041.12s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2042.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2042.8799999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2043.2s)]
*  And professor or senator, not senator. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2044.24s)]
*  Admiral Ludwig could easily be some of these women's fathers. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2048.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2052.56s)]
*  He's how old is 50 at the time she was 50, 50 when she died. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2052.88s)]
*  Dude, she fucking got her dime on and fucking balled out. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2058.48s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2061.04s)]
*  Like to me, look, I've long said white men should be allowed to play in the WNBA. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2062.08s)]
*  As have I. But that's not a white man. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2068.56s)]
*  That's a white woman. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2070.0s)]
*  But you know, right now it is platformed. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  But see, but here's what I think also a lot of our like. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2072.88s)]
*  The structure we know so far, like all the rulebooks are male based and female based. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2077.52s)]
*  Like there's a lot of people that don't want to like you get stuck in the patterns. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2081.92s)]
*  And of what was of what the way things have been, it's hard to be like. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2086.48s)]
*  OK, now we're going to just change it up, you know. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2090.96s)]
*  Well, change takes time to I'm not against it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2093.6s)]
*  It's just like. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2096.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but wait a minute. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2097.68s)]
*  If you're a mother and you've dedicated your whole life to getting your daughter to practice. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2099.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2104.56s)]
*  And to get a scholarship because you don't have the money. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2105.04s)]
*  You need the money and your daughter is really gifted at tennis or she's really gifted at [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2107.12s)]
*  wrestling or she's really good for singing like Selena. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2111.44s)]
*  Well, no singing is not a good example. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2113.92s)]
*  I'm talking about a sport. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2115.2s)]
*  She's she's she's she's so a body sport, not a scholarship to basketball or track. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2116.4s)]
*  OK, and. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  A man, a biological man says I'm now a woman. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2123.04s)]
*  I'm not going to get any. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2126.08s)]
*  I'm not even going to get any estrogen. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2126.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm just a woman. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2128.24s)]
*  I identify as a woman and goes and decides to. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2128.96s)]
*  To compete and takes that scholarship away from your daughter. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2134.32s)]
*  You can understand. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2139.92s)]
*  How frustrating that would be. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2142.48s)]
*  Oh, it'd be heartbreaking for the mother and for the daughter. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2143.84s)]
*  And also why feminists now go wait, wait, wait. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  We've been fighting so hard to navigate this. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2151.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2153.76s)]
*  How I don't know how to navigate it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  The turf's. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2155.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, look exclusionary radical feminist. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, so then if you bring that up, though, you're called a transphobe or you're. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2159.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not fair either. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2163.12s)]
*  We're just trying to solve a problem and bring up an issue that is real. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2166.56s)]
*  So now what do we do about that? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2171.92s)]
*  Like, what do you do about that shit? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2173.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't want somebody who feels different or feels like they're a woman or vice versa, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2176.3199999999997s)]
*  but they were born another sex. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2183.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want them being excluded. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2185.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2188.64s)]
*  But at the same time, you know. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2190.4s)]
*  They can't be cheating and just putting a camara on every fricking, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2192.24s)]
*  you know, chick at 105. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2196.24s)]
*  That's what's. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2198.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but that's kind of what's. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2199.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the dilemma. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2203.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2205.3599999999997s)]
*  It makes sense because you're making a lot of rules where it's like, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2205.6s)]
*  OK, whatever you identify as, that's what you can play as. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2208.24s)]
*  So, of course, some people is going to bend the system. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2211.4399999999996s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2213.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but that's a political. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2214.4799999999996s)]
*  That's also an ideological and political stance. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2215.8399999999997s)]
*  So if you can just identify in whatever you say. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2218.9599999999996s)]
*  But that's what it's getting to be. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2221.84s)]
*  Well, so what? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2222.88s)]
*  So then that means that your whatever you you conceive and conceptualize. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2223.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2229.76s)]
*  Is truth. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2230.0s)]
*  Then this is Derrida. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2231.52s)]
*  Then there's no truth. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  So in other words, if we don't have a standard on which we can stand, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2234.48s)]
*  if there's not a standard that we can more that we can anchor into. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2239.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  Just so that we can know that we can distinguish. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2244.7200000000003s)]
*  Of course, life is the same. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2248.56s)]
*  You have to have that. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2249.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, but but but no, because there are a lot of there's a philosophy out there [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2250.8s)]
*  and it comes from Derrida and that says, no, there should be zero categories. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2254.96s)]
*  It's why the Maoists put everybody in the same uniform and with the same haircut. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  It was the idea of eradicating literally any distinction. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2266.7200000000003s)]
*  But Mother Nature is going to have her say in that, of course, you know, it's of course. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2272.2400000000002s)]
*  And also the number. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2276.6400000000003s)]
*  This is what gets me. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2278.1600000000003s)]
*  The number of people that it applies to to immediately take that template [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2279.28s)]
*  and put it against the the bill, the the majority, the mass majority. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2287.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2295.44s)]
*  And then a lot of times they try and force it in immediately. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2295.92s)]
*  That's the kind of shit where you get so much rebuttal [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  because it's disrespectful to just force it immediately. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2303.52s)]
*  I know it's disrespectful also to. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2306.48s)]
*  It's a little bit more than that, buddy. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2308.24s)]
*  If you even talk about this, if you even. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2309.9199999999996s)]
*  Now, if you were to if you had the point of view, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2314.3999999999996s)]
*  say you had the point of view that there are two sexes or that that your biology is what sticks. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2317.52s)]
*  OK, you'll get deplatformed. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2323.8399999999997s)]
*  You're considered you're you're you're practicing hate speech [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  and you will be deplatformed from everywhere, including YouTube. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2329.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2335.12s)]
*  And Patreon anywhere else. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2335.7599999999998s)]
*  So we can think stuff like that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2337.92s)]
*  We can't say it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2339.12s)]
*  You're not you're not allowed to speak. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2339.8399999999997s)]
*  So where do you say you just go chiseling into a bench? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2341.8399999999997s)]
*  The First Amendment doesn't really exist anymore. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2344.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2347.6s)]
*  And that's very. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2348.4s)]
*  It's a sign saying it's very dangerous [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2349.92s)]
*  and nobody I don't think enough people are talking about it. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2353.44s)]
*  And I certainly don't think enough people [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2355.44s)]
*  who are pushing this narrative really understand what's what. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2357.12s)]
*  No, a lot of people are just chasing clout. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2360.3199999999997s)]
*  They're chasing weenie and and vagina. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2362.16s)]
*  They just want all that. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2365.92s)]
*  They want any type of fucking body, you know, genital clout. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2366.72s)]
*  But what I'm saying is have a separate league for these [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2370.72s)]
*  for the middlemen of the universe. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2377.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2379.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, because, yeah, it's like if if I'm a young lady [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2380.08s)]
*  who's worked my butt off and is about feminism, you know, like women, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2385.6s)]
*  we need the opportunity, this and that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2389.68s)]
*  And then a fella comes along [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2394.16s)]
*  and he. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2397.2s)]
*  But you have lawyers on the left who are now calling this. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2398.16s)]
*  They're they're on the left. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2401.7599999999998s)]
*  They they fight for a lot of, you know, a lot of liberal causes. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2402.9599999999996s)]
*  I can't remember the woman's name, but she's a champion of [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2406.3199999999997s)]
*  she's a left wing lawyer and she's a champion of all these causes, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2409.4399999999996s)]
*  the social justice causes. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2412.3199999999997s)]
*  And she said she said this is misogyny. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2414.0s)]
*  And I was like, damn. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2417.8399999999997s)]
*  She said it's a misogyny if it's a man and if it's a transgender person. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2419.04s)]
*  She was saying that that for men to come into women's sports now like this. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2422.64s)]
*  But these aren't men. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2426.48s)]
*  Well, she was saying that these are rocks, biological men who are coming into female sports [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2428.4s)]
*  because they identify that, you know, they identify as women. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2433.76s)]
*  Now she was saying, you know, you hear women on the other side, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2436.64s)]
*  you hear feminists now fighting that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2440.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2443.12s)]
*  So it's a fight, man. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2443.44s)]
*  And I just sit back and I'm like, damn. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2444.8s)]
*  And then you got science. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2447.52s)]
*  Put them at straw weight. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2448.72s)]
*  Look, I say get them at a weight where is there a weight class you could get them at [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2449.68s)]
*  if you say specifically UFC? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2455.76s)]
*  Is there a weight class you could get them at where it would be where it evens out a little bit? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2458.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem with that is that you've got a different bone structure [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2463.76s)]
*  and you've got like so so when you're talking about [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2466.96s)]
*  punching people in the face and speed and all that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2473.2000000000003s)]
*  And even even even I think women and men have a different read on on split second timing. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2473.44s)]
*  So women tend to hesitate. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2482.6400000000003s)]
*  Even the high champions hesitate just a split second. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2485.44s)]
*  Oh, women will start bitching in an instant. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2488.3199999999997s)]
*  Than men do. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2490.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2491.3599999999997s)]
*  And so that's a huge advantage in striking. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2491.52s)]
*  So you've got so many issues. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2494.16s)]
*  So when you're talking about women in fighting, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2495.7599999999998s)]
*  you're talking about transgender women in fighting. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2498.48s)]
*  What stage are they at? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2500.8799999999997s)]
*  Like what stage are they at in their transition? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2502.64s)]
*  How much estrogen they have in relation to testosterone? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2504.72s)]
*  Do they still have the different bone structure [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2507.52s)]
*  and the different muscularity that gives a man much bigger advantage? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2510.4s)]
*  I think they there should be then a separate league or something. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2514.0s)]
*  And I hate to separate it, but it's just it's when you start catering to [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2517.84s)]
*  you have to cater to the masses first. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2525.2s)]
*  It's just I feel like it's where you have to it's the most people. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2527.76s)]
*  You know, it's like it's like the same when you get all these people to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2532.0s)]
*  reconfigure their bathrooms and do all that. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2535.2s)]
*  It's like there's nobody transgender in this town, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2537.28s)]
*  but you're going to have a news media come here [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2540.72s)]
*  and say these bathrooms are for men only. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2543.92s)]
*  Well, you know, there's only 11 people in town. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  People are trying to piss. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2548.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2549.12s)]
*  In some ways, that's the strength of this country, though. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2549.3599999999997s)]
*  Like in some ways, maybe. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2552.0s)]
*  And I'm not trying to be old sighted. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2554.4s)]
*  I just think you have to like, yes, you welcome them in and you find a way to do it, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2555.8399999999997s)]
*  but it can't be immediate. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2561.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's sometimes where I think the media fails is they want it immediate. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2562.8799999999997s)]
*  They want it now. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2566.96s)]
*  Well, I think the better way to put it is that you want to protect [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2568.6400000000003s)]
*  the marginalized and the minorities rights, right? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2572.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2575.76s)]
*  Not at the expense of other rights. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2576.0s)]
*  And that's the balancing act. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2578.8s)]
*  So if you're if you're trumping other rights or you are discriminating [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2580.08s)]
*  against another group to make room for this new group of victims [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2586.1600000000003s)]
*  or whoever you consider to be marginalized. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2589.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2592.4s)]
*  Now you're just now you're just moving money from one column to the other, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  but you're not really actually making the world more equitable. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2596.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2598.64s)]
*  You're actually so so so the idea would be if you have to have California, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2598.96s)]
*  if you're a public traded company in California, you had to have if you had a board of seven, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2604.3999999999996s)]
*  you had a board of five, two had to be women. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2609.8399999999997s)]
*  If you had a board of seven, four had to or three had to be women. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2612.3999999999996s)]
*  They just enforce that right. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2616.48s)]
*  So you have to have women on your board. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2617.7599999999998s)]
*  Now they want color. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2620.3199999999997s)]
*  Now it has to have diversity. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2621.6s)]
*  So if you are if you are the board, if you represent the board, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2622.64s)]
*  you're on board of a company which makes decisions for the company. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2625.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2628.64s)]
*  It's a public traded company. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2629.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2630.3199999999997s)]
*  You now have a diversity quota and you now have an this is enforced. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2630.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if they got the diversity quota through post, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2634.48s)]
*  but they did with the female course. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2636.72s)]
*  So the board cannot be all male no matter what. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2638.7999999999997s)]
*  So if you have so the idea is if you're really qualified for the job, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2641.6s)]
*  but you happen to have balls, you know, and a dick or whatever or certain chromosome, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2645.52s)]
*  you are excluded. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2652.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2653.04s)]
*  Damn. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2653.68s)]
*  You got to take a backseat. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2654.16s)]
*  So now now you're discriminating against men for having for having their biology. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2655.04s)]
*  And now you have to have a conversation about biology. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2659.44s)]
*  And if you're going to have if you're going to enforce [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2661.44s)]
*  biological women are allowed have must be on the boards. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2663.52s)]
*  Well, now what about what about gender fluid people? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2666.64s)]
*  What about are you going to represent? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2670.72s)]
*  And that is why you relocate to another state where they're not. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2672.64s)]
*  That's what happens. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2675.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2676.88s)]
*  Because it's just don't know how to do business that way. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2677.44s)]
*  Because if you have a business and you and you're you're responsible to your shareholders, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2679.92s)]
*  you go, wait, I want the best people. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2683.52s)]
*  I don't give a shit what they are. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2685.76s)]
*  I want the best people on them. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2686.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2688.48s)]
*  Especially if it's a small family business. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2688.88s)]
*  Now you got your son cutting his penis off just so he can work at the shop. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2691.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2694.7200000000003s)]
*  Like this is publicly traded. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2695.36s)]
*  Theo, you're going too crazy. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, my bad, man. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2698.08s)]
*  But yeah, it's just like but it just feels like that is a small business owner. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2699.28s)]
*  You feel like, well, if my business ever grows, I'm gonna have to fucking, you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2702.08s)]
*  get, you know, I'm gonna have to install a dick on my wife just to fucking make ends meet over here. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  But that paranoia in your head as a business person, you're like, I'm gonna go to a place. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2711.6s)]
*  The government comes in and forces you to do that. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2716.72s)]
*  That's mandated. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2719.2s)]
*  And so now what you're doing is you're enforcing equality. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2721.2s)]
*  You're enforcing equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2724.4s)]
*  And what they're doing in Hollywood, if you want your movie to be in the Oscars now, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2727.7599999999998s)]
*  be an Oscar. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2732.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you need to have an amoeba in there. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2733.52s)]
*  You got to have you have to have color in the cast. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2735.6s)]
*  You have to have color behind the scenes too now. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2738.56s)]
*  But it's gotten which look, I think it should all be I kind of believe it should all be based on [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2740.7999999999997s)]
*  just the percentages of the people that are in the country. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2746.16s)]
*  Like, you know, if the if ethnicity is a certain percent, then that percentage should be. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2748.72s)]
*  You'd be in trouble with that. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2753.92s)]
*  You think? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2754.96s)]
*  Oh, my God, it's a terrible idea. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2755.52s)]
*  Terrible idea because because then then then you then again, all you're doing is looking at [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  numbers and you need the people that get jobs should be the ones who are the best for the job. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2762.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2767.8399999999997s)]
*  I agree. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2768.08s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2768.7999999999997s)]
*  If if if most people are great for it. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2769.68s)]
*  Yeah, most people are great for the job are all black women. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2772.24s)]
*  Then all black women should be in there. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2775.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2777.3599999999997s)]
*  If it's all Asian and all Asian, I don't give a fuck. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2777.68s)]
*  Whoever's best for the job, man, and have blind auditions the way they did. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2780.56s)]
*  So with with orchestras, they were all male. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2784.3199999999997s)]
*  So they started just having blind auditions. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2787.04s)]
*  So you couldn't see if it was a man or woman playing that instrument. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2788.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  You go behind a curtain and play. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2791.52s)]
*  You just have to hear. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2792.8s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2794.32s)]
*  Women now represent even more than half of the of the instrumentation in I think the San [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2796.0s)]
*  Francisco Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2802.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2805.04s)]
*  You see a lot of those harmonics, a lot of ladies out there, a lot of dimes out there [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2805.36s)]
*  playing the flute on the lyre. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2808.64s)]
*  Do you play an instrument? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2811.04s)]
*  Uh, what did I play a little bit of piano? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2812.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2815.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2815.92s)]
*  For real. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2816.24s)]
*  I'm getting me a little hung. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2816.64s)]
*  I got me a little nice little place over there and [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=2817.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, man, it's, I guess you're right, because now the whole discussion has come back to full circle [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3287.92s)]
*  where it's like the original argument is now butting up with, it's just going to become a [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3294.1600000000003s)]
*  spiral that's, it's a never ending. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3299.92s)]
*  So how do you figure it out in the West? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3301.76s)]
*  We figured out a way around this stuff. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3303.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying the West didn't have its share of all kinds of prejudice and all that, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3306.7200000000003s)]
*  but the West has done a really, at least the West is the first country to talk about it [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3311.84s)]
*  and tackle it head on and respect the rights without killing, killing people. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3315.84s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3322.56s)]
*  So, you know, so, but the West, the idea, the idea, I'm saying we've implemented it very well, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3323.36s)]
*  but much better than any other country. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3328.88s)]
*  The idea is you treat people as an individual. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3330.8s)]
*  If you, because, because if you start categorizing people, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3333.92s)]
*  you'll never run out of categories. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3337.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3339.52s)]
*  I mean, if you want to include men and women on the board and that's mandated, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3339.6800000000003s)]

*  What about dwarves? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3347.92s)]

*  What, where are we going to stop? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3353.28s)]
*  We need the deaf, man. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3354.32s)]
*  Where are we going to stop this? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3355.36s)]

*  you would never run out of categories. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3364.8s)]
*  Let them keep going, man. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3366.88s)]
*  Treat people as individuals. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3367.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3369.28s)]
*  Have a meritocracy. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3369.52s)]
*  It's the only way at the level of detail to run a society. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3370.56s)]
*  You can't do it any other way. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3374.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3375.84s)]
*  And, and when you, and also I don't mind if you have a company and you don't even ask people up. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3376.16s)]
*  I don't think you should ask people if sexual orientation or any of that because obviously. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3380.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, who cares? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3385.36s)]
*  Well, obviously you don't want to get somebody a reason to discriminate. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3386.24s)]
*  So don't make anything. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3388.9599999999996s)]

*  But then I just feel like you. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3445.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3448.56s)]
*  Then it would start to affect the company's pocketbooks and then you wouldn't see so many [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3448.96s)]
*  companies. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3452.56s)]
*  I feel like be so outspoken. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3453.12s)]
*  Well, I'm worried. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3454.56s)]
*  Make their employees feel like they have to vote a certain way or this type of thing. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3455.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3458.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I worry about, I wish there were more options for, and there are becoming more and [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3459.3599999999997s)]
*  more options for technology. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3463.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3466.0s)]
*  There are, there is technology that's, that's coming out where you won't be as, as reliant [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3466.24s)]
*  on all the massive companies. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3471.52s)]
*  At least I'm hopeful. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3473.28s)]
*  I don't think that's good for anyone, but I am concerned and I am sympathetic to big [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3474.4s)]
*  techs worry about misinformation, malinformation and disinformation. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3479.84s)]
*  That's very dangerous. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3484.72s)]
*  But that's always been out there. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3486.0s)]
*  Like you could always listen to an idiot. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3487.52s)]
*  I know, but say, say you have a platform, say you say you're Facebook. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3489.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3492.96s)]
*  And, and you, you, you have a technology that you've invented. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3493.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3497.68s)]
*  And everybody's on Facebook. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3498.16s)]
*  And all of a sudden the government of a country, because it's worldwide, the government of that [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3499.6s)]
*  country says they start planting stories on Facebook that you know are categorically false [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3504.64s)]
*  that are demonizing a minority political group because they might be the Uyghurs. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3510.48s)]
*  They might be the Rohingya. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3516.7999999999997s)]
*  They might be whatever in certain countries. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3517.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3519.52s)]
*  And you go and you start talking about how, how they, they kill children or they, you do [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3520.08s)]
*  whatever to rouse up the majority in your country's ire, to rouse up their anger. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3526.0s)]
*  And you just start planting fake stories and you get more and more people more and more [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3531.92s)]
*  outraged about CNN, whatever it might be. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3535.92s)]
*  And now you have, now you have a vigilante mob of 5,000 that have all been talking on Facebook [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3538.88s)]
*  and they decide let's go kill these Rohingya, these Uyghurs, these trans people, these [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3545.92s)]
*  these Republicans or these Democrats over here or these liberals or these conservatives over here. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3556.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3561.28s)]
*  History is full of that. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3562.16s)]
*  I mean the Tsar in Russia when the economy and shit was going bad, he would say, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3563.92s)]
*  you know what, let's blame the Jews. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3569.68s)]
*  Let's go, hey, hey, hey, all you guys, it's the Jews that are doing this. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3572.08s)]
*  So you'd have mobs of men with bats and knives and they would come into the Jewish [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3577.28s)]
*  Pales, the ghetto and fucking burn down the synagogue and kill as many people as they could [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3583.36s)]
*  and rape everybody and do all kinds of horrible things. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3590.32s)]
*  That was the story of the Jew in Russia forever and that's where the Zionist movement was born. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3593.52s)]
*  The idea was if this is going to keep happening, we're going to keep getting killed. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3600.2400000000002s)]
*  We need a homeland. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  We need a homeland. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3604.8s)]
*  We have nowhere to go because we're always a minority. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3606.1600000000003s)]
*  So what I'm saying is that now with Facebook and with Big Tech, if you're allowed to spread [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3609.44s)]
*  information, if you're really organized about it and you're allowed to spread information that is [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3614.56s)]
*  categorically false, but is also galvanizing an enemy, galvanizing people to actually take [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3618.8799999999997s)]
*  violent action. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3625.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3627.04s)]
*  Like people that trade Pokemon cards almost. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3627.2799999999997s)]
*  But what if they're doing it, which apparently they were, I think at the Rohingya, I think at [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3629.92s)]
*  Burma or whatever, Myanmar, okay. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3633.7599999999998s)]
*  So people were really doing this. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3635.68s)]
*  They were meeting on Facebook groups and then having beliefs and then going out and taking [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3636.7999999999997s)]
*  action. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3642.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3642.48s)]
*  So now you have someone like Mark Zuckerberg. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3642.96s)]
*  What's Zuckerberg and all of them supposed to do? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3646.72s)]
*  They're responsible. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3649.44s)]
*  They're looking at the moral responsibility. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3650.96s)]
*  They're looking at all the responsibility. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3653.3599999999997s)]
*  They're looking at the financial, I mean the legal responsibility. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3656.56s)]
*  But it's also just a moral thing. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3659.7599999999998s)]
*  But also. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3661.3599999999997s)]
*  Problem because they don't know how to deal with that. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3662.0s)]
*  I wouldn't know how to deal with that. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  How the fuck do you deal with that? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3664.96s)]
*  So now you've got to get really, really draconian about it. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3666.08s)]
*  Now you've got to be like, look, if you guys are going to start talking about masks that [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3670.8s)]
*  aren't being effective or you're going to start talking about how vaccines are not effective, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3675.2s)]
*  which by the way, they are effective. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3679.28s)]
*  If you're going to start talking about that and you're going to start spreading all these [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3681.2s)]
*  documentaries that don't have any basis in science, I'm just using it as an example. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3685.12s)]
*  I guarantee I'll get a lot of shit just for saying that. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3690.0s)]
*  But if you keep doing that, right, they have to kind of go, the science is saying this [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3692.48s)]
*  and you guys are saying this. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3701.04s)]
*  They have to take a stand. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3702.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3704.16s)]
*  But then you're going to be stuck by what that person's views of the world are and what [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3704.4s)]
*  they- [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3709.2000000000003s)]
*  It's tough. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3709.36s)]
*  Because what if they have a total, their upbringing is totally, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3710.88s)]
*  they live from a complete different place. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3715.12s)]
*  And I think you have a lot of these people are all from the same spot, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3718.08s)]
*  the same type of tribe and the same type of, there are a lot of the same just type of people. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3720.72s)]
*  So I just did an interview with- [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3728.08s)]
*  Same ilk. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3729.68s)]
*  Yeah, same ilk. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3730.3199999999997s)]
*  I did an interview with Alastair Bostwick. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3730.8799999999997s)]
*  It's on YouTube now. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3732.7999999999997s)]
*  And he was a reporter for Huffington Post, for Buzzfeed, and now he works for Verizon.com, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3734.16s)]
*  which is kind of like, he's a really good journalist. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  He just did a crazy video on Woody Allen and how one side of that piece was on Woody Allen. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3743.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's basically defending Woody Allen, but [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3748.16s)]
*  he's a liberal guy. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3750.08s)]
*  But he said, he was talking about how I said to him, I said, why is the press so left wing? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  And he goes, because most of the people who are in the press are from LA and New York [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3758.0s)]
*  and Chicago and the big cities. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3763.36s)]
*  And they just happen to be younger people tend to lean left. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3765.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not like a conspiracy. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3767.7599999999998s)]
*  It's that they tend to be socially progressive. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3769.36s)]
*  And so what you're going to get is you're going to get more people in journalism who happen to be [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3771.6s)]
*  of that, the way he was describing it was really interesting. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3776.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3778.0s)]
*  That makes sense kind of. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3778.16s)]
*  Yeah. So like you said, it's the same ilk. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3779.2799999999997s)]
*  If you have one particular ilk and they're usually educated, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3781.2s)]
*  they're usually super educated from really good schools. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3784.96s)]
*  And they tend to come from socioeconomic backgrounds that are of higher class. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3787.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. So they have a different, but that perspective of the world growing up, like, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3792.64s)]
*  like, dude, some of my richest friends have been the absolute most scared about this pandemic. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3796.3199999999997s)]
*  Smartest friends have been the most scared about this pandemic. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3803.2799999999997s)]
*  That is just ridiculous. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, like, so I think there's a [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3807.3599999999997s)]
*  level there too, where it's just so overkill and so out of touch with what like [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3809.12s)]
*  a regular working day to day man and woman couple that wants to have a traditional kind of lifestyle. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3814.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3820.88s)]
*  And then everything is this. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3821.2s)]
*  But then you have a lot of those types of people who are far left, who end up being [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3823.8399999999997s)]
*  40 year old women who are lonely, who have no fucking children and who were trying to like, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3827.44s)]
*  you know, fly down to Barbados to jumpstart their wombs somehow on some [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3832.24s)]
*  fabled machine or something, you know, or wandering around their house and dyeing their hair fucking [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3837.68s)]
*  75 colors and fucking sawing their tits off for magic or whatever. Like it just gets. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3842.3999999999996s)]
*  So then you have a lot, you have a lot of people who are just unspoken for and who feel unspoken [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3848.9599999999996s)]
*  for even just to ask questions. And then that's where it gets really, really spooky. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3854.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, you ever heard the expression weird? So, so. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3859.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I'm not like some right wing Trump or not, but also I'm a person who believes I should be [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3863.04s)]
*  able to talk about stuff and ask questions and not feel weird if I want to also say stuff and get [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3867.28s)]
*  something wrong. I agree. Like how else do you even. I agree. Be a comedian, the whole. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3873.6s)]
*  But it's so scary that you're even having to be careful. Like we are both very careful right now [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3879.2s)]
*  on a podcast about what we're saying and how we're talking. That never used to be. I have to be [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3883.68s)]
*  careful because I don't know what I'm saying a lot of times too. So my brain is very careful [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3887.92s)]
*  because it doesn't know what I'm talking about a lot of times. Like you said, you're allowed to be [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3891.76s)]
*  you're allowed to get it wrong. Right. But so now you have a group, you have a society, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3896.5600000000004s)]
*  people that feel like they're not allowed to get anything at least to trial and error. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3900.5600000000004s)]
*  That's right. You have a ton of people that feel that way. Yeah. How does that feel to some, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3905.36s)]
*  I mean, it's just, that's debilitating. That's debilitating to people. It is debilitating. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3909.36s)]
*  It's awful. It's awful. I mean, it's funny because when they did any experiment they ever did, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3914.8s)]
*  right? So if you think about like anything, you know, Frankenstein, well, no, any, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3918.88s)]
*  that would be one Frankenstein is a good example. The man tried it on his brother. Look at Louis [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3924.2400000000002s)]
*  Van Gogh. Look at, do you know what, you know, what Frankenstein symbolized the idea that machines [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3929.04s)]
*  were taking over machines were now taken over humanity. We're having the same talk a hundred [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3934.96s)]
*  years later about how machines are going to take over and make man obsolete. That was something that [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3940.88s)]
*  Mary Shelley, who wrote that book, that was the thesis of that book. Like when man meshes with [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3947.68s)]
*  machine, we'll lose our humanity. It's kind of fucking cyclical. But most of the studies [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3953.04s)]
*  on economics, on social behavior, on social, we all talk about whatever it might be. Like, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3959.6s)]
*  you know, when you say things like, well, most people, you know, most people tend to be more [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3964.4s)]
*  emotional about this. It was all done on what they call, the acronym is weird, Western, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3968.96s)]
*  industrialized, educated, rich, developed people from those countries, from Westernized, educated, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3977.28s)]
*  industrialized, rich, developed countries. So most professors were doing their fucking experiments [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3987.28s)]
*  on people who are college educated, or at least, you know, had had money, were from a developed [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=3994.64s)]
*  country, definitely like Europe or America, there was never any of it done on people who came from [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4001.04s)]
*  other parts of the world who didn't come from industrialized, developed, educated backgrounds. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4005.92s)]
*  So so much of what we know is, has been skewed just by the nature of how experimentation was [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4011.6s)]
*  done and who is available to do the experiments on. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4017.84s)]
*  so we keep running into these issues. We keep running into these issues. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4023.12s)]
*  Yeah, man. Look, it's spooky time to be, it's like, is it spooky? It's a great time to be alive. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4026.96s)]
*  It's the only time that we get that we know of right now. I'm scared. It's also, it's a scary time. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4032.16s)]
*  But there has to be, there's always like, a way out of things. It's like, I mean, for example, like, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4039.92s)]
*  you know, you can still, if you shut yourself off to some of the media, and you just let it go and [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4047.44s)]
*  do its thing, you can still live a normal, straight life or gay life, whichever you want. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4053.76s)]
*  You don't have to get into the fights. You don't have to engage in it because some of it is out of [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4065.92s)]
*  my control. But then also it's like, every voice that was even like questioning or anything is, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4070.8s)]
*  has been extremely silenced. And that's not good. You know, I don't feel like that that kind of [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4078.96s)]
*  stuff is good. No, that's the problem. The other argument, like Sam Trippley, and I always have [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4084.24s)]
*  these arguments on- Oh, I've talked to Sam, dude. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4088.96s)]
*  Oh, it's great. But we have this podcast, Conspiracies Social Club, and I debunk conspiracies, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4091.6s)]
*  right? He seems to win a lot. But by the way, by the way, if you watch Conspiracies Social Club, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4096.32s)]
*  I think we may have to move over to Rockfin because they took us off Vimeo. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4100.96s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4106.72s)]
*  Patreon didn't let us do- Vimeo took you off? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4107.2s)]
*  Yeah, because they don't allow any conspiracy talk, even though I debunk it. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4109.04s)]
*  Vimeo did? Vimeo should be lucky to have anybody on that fucking thing. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4112.96s)]
*  I know, but they took us down because they have a strict policy against it. And I'm like, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4116.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm an anti-conspiracist. I'm trying to debunk it. But they're like, no. So I don't know what [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4120.32s)]
*  their practices are. Well, it's just become general and blanket, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4126.0s)]
*  which is crazy because that's the same thing that they that that like, like, kind of left leaning [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4129.76s)]
*  things say that people are doing about gender and stuff. But you're doing it in the term, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4138.0s)]
*  the term words that you use to terminate like anything that pops up. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4143.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm trying to in earnest debunk conspiracies. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4146.8s)]
*  That breaks my heart, bro. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4150.400000000001s)]
*  And, and, you know, so we have to go over that. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4151.2s)]
*  That's why you got to get a Glock, dude. You got to get your family and go be somewhere. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4153.2s)]
*  I know. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4157.52s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of people, a lot of people were saying this rat race [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4158.32s)]
*  doesn't even accept me anymore. They not only that, but they mistreat me on social platforms [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4162.08s)]
*  where I'm even just trying to be a regular person who errs and who is human and trying to be funny [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4170.08s)]
*  or just trying to be human. Yeah. Like, and it's just a lot of it is people who never wanted to [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4178.16s)]
*  take any risks just sitting somewhere flowing into this. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4185.12s)]
*  They're going to always exist though. It's the problem is corporations, the money listens. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4190.24s)]
*  Right. The money, you know, until consumers. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4195.44s)]
*  That's why you need to get an app that sends people to different places. They can support [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4199.04s)]
*  companies that also mimic some of their beliefs or at least are open to it. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4203.84s)]
*  Because then once it starts to affect the pocketbooks of companies, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4210.72s)]
*  they'll quit the bullshit. How about due process? How about just that? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4214.32s)]
*  So, you know, if Disney is going to completely cancel Gina Carano for writing Bebop Boop and just [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4219.2s)]
*  and having a clumsy comparison to the Holocaust, which wasn't even that clumsy compared to a lot [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4225.04s)]
*  of people who were on the left who didn't get canceled. Yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4229.28s)]
*  You know, if you're going to do that, then until consumers say, I'm not upping my subscription to [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4231.679999999999s)]
*  Disney, I'm not watching Lucas films anymore. Right. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4237.5199999999995s)]
*  Until they do that and until Disney sees that when they cancel someone like Gina Carano [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4240.72s)]
*  or they cancel anybody due to due process, they get it actually hurts their dollar. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4245.76s)]
*  It actually hurts their sales because right now they just don't want to deal with any kind of [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4251.68s)]
*  Twitter thing. But it's so crazy who gives a fuck about it. It's just like they do because [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4257.04s)]
*  they don't want to deal with the backlash because those voices are so loud and organized. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4262.64s)]
*  They'll go away in a week. Yeah. Not when it's just it creates too much bad press because what [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4265.84s)]
*  does the press do? The press needs clicks. The press, everybody in the press talking to [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4274.0s)]
*  Alastair Bostwick again about this. He's like, when you're a fucking journalist, you want clicks. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4278.88s)]
*  You want to create sensation. Right. You want to write. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4285.84s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4288.72s)]
*  You can't do if you're going to do a documentary on Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4290.0s)]
*  you can't take a balanced approach. Nobody wants to see it. They want you want to hit [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4293.52s)]
*  piece the way the Michael Jackson thing was. You got to you got to come up. You got to come hard [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4296.72s)]
*  from one angle. Right. Because then then we're like, yeah, we got a bad guy and a good guy. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4300.400000000001s)]
*  Right. So this is and then this is Dustin Poirier taught me this man. He said, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4304.320000000001s)]
*  this is when that Mike Perry thing came out. Mike Perry had done some things. He was kind of losing [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4308.88s)]
*  losing it. He was going through a tough moment like about eight months ago or a year ago. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4313.360000000001s)]
*  And I was talking to dust one time. He goes, you know, man, I don't click on that kind of stuff. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4317.76s)]
*  When people send me that kind of stuff, I don't click on it because I don't want that in my world. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4321.52s)]
*  He said, I don't want that in my world. I don't want to look at people that I care about or other [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4325.040000000001s)]
*  humans in ways where people are just trying to pinpoint them into one little space or one little [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4330.4800000000005s)]
*  moment. Good for him. He just said it's not fair. And so since then, man, I've tried to stay off [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4338.240000000001s)]
*  of like when people sent that kind of shit, don't send me that. It's like this porn. We use it as [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4343.200000000001s)]
*  porn. So as long as we keep doing that, that kind of stuff's going to keep happening. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4349.28s)]
*  And as long as you keep rewarding cancel culture. And you do it by clicks. We do that by clicks. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4354.96s)]
*  When you click on it, then you fucking saying, I support this, even if you don't. That's right. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4360.08s)]
*  That's what's crazy. So that's where the weird addiction comes in. It's like, we're just, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4366.08s)]
*  just like the fact that Disney makes amazing products and my kids love their movies. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4370.88s)]
*  They're good. When a massive company like that, you know, cancel someone like Gina Carano and we [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4375.36s)]
*  still, you know, we're still patrons of that company in a way we're all complicit. Right. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4381.599999999999s)]
*  It's so hard to fight, man. It's hard to fight because there's such tech as the new fossil fuel, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4387.5199999999995s)]
*  man. Yeah. That's the oil. What happened with this country singer who used the N word? He didn't [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4392.4s)]
*  really, I think people kind of galvanized that people kind of go, this is too much or what [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4397.12s)]
*  happened? He's a, I mean, Morgan's a friend of mine. He was on a podcast he was on a couple [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4401.92s)]
*  months ago. He used it. He called his friend the N word in the street. He came back and apologized. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4406.16s)]
*  He said, I'm going to try to do better. And you know, the media did what they did. They ripped him [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4413.12s)]

*  and this, and I'm, is that suddenly there were news articles that would never even watch Morgan. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4484.08s)]
*  That was the guy's name. Yeah. That would never even, and they're, they're using it in their [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4490.24s)]
*  titling, like the N word, the N word. So they're basically using the N word to get you to go. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4495.44s)]
*  Of course. So who's really using it? One guy who uses it on the street calling his white friend, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4500.0s)]
*  or the white press that makes money by getting clicks. That's what burn. And it's like, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4505.76s)]

*  money in clicks and there's money in telling your readers, your echo chamber, exactly what they want [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4520.4s)]
*  to hear and what they believe anyway. And already you, you will, you will continue to, to polarize [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4526.08s)]
*  the press. And now you look at anything that comes out of Huffington Post. You're like, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4533.04s)]
*  I know exactly how they feel. So why am I going to read this? Right. Or Fox. Oh, here we go. But [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4537.2s)]
*  it's like, um, here's a question, but what else is that thinking? I have one more thought on this, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4541.84s)]
*  but it's just when they, when, I mean, and he came out and said for himself, you know, he said, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4547.92s)]
*  you know, what do you want it to say on it? So it's like, it's his thing, but some, I don't know. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4553.44s)]
*  Sometimes you feel like it'd be, it's just crazy how you can go and buy the, on certain platforms, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4561.04s)]
*  you can buy the N word and listen to it. You know, you can pay $2 for it, $1.99 per song and go [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4566.96s)]
*  listen. Oh yeah. You know, it's like, maybe don't make it available to white people. Well, I think [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4573.68s)]
*  that this guy somehow got like, he, they tried to cancel him and I think his fans were like, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4579.44s)]

*  years. His music is just great. I mean, I think, you know, uh, and he's a great kid. I was at his [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4589.76s)]
*  house a couple nights before the video stuff and there were black guys over there with him. He [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4595.52s)]
*  had, it's not like, I've seen racist people. He's not a racist guy. He's not a racist guy. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4600.64s)]
*  So, and that's obvious to most human people with a brain. But yeah, but intention doesn't matter [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4606.72s)]
*  anymore. It's just consequence. What's this question? I see a guy asking a question. Yeah, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4612.8s)]
*  let's get out of this. Sorry. And I didn't really want to talk about that, but it's okay. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4616.96s)]

*  You had to give each other three compliments that didn't have anything to do with comedy [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4633.28s)]
*  or a mullet. What would they be? It's a hockey haircut. First of all, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4637.04s)]
*  that's good. That's a great question. Three compliments that had nothing to do with comedy [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4641.76s)]
*  or the mullet. I would say this. You want to, who goes first, Nate? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4646.16s)]
*  Brian. Okay. Go, go one, go every other. Fine. I'm your boss, but Brian, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4652.4s)]
*  I would say, I would say that you're, I think you have a very original brain [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4657.44s)]
*  and I love that about you. Okay. And I think, I mean, I'm not allowed to talk about comedy, but [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4666.5599999999995s)]
*  it's, it's very difficult to separate your, you see, you have what's called original expression. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4671.599999999999s)]
*  You're just original. You're an original generally, and that's so fucking rare. And then I think you're, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4678.4s)]
*  you're very loyal. You're a loyal fucking dude. And you also have overcome something. I think [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4686.88s)]
*  most people don't even understand. I mean, I think what you've overcome [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4696.24s)]
*  over your family, your mother and all that, I don't think anybody realizes how huge that is. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4701.12s)]
*  I don't, and I think that's, that always is going to be something that you're contending with, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4706.32s)]
*  but the wrestle, you know, it's that Jacob's ladder thing when, when you wrestle the angel, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4711.36s)]
*  the angel that you wrestle on a day to day basis is what makes, and you're winning that you're [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4716.0s)]
*  winning, whether you know it or not, you win it every day. And it's, it actually makes the world [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4721.68s)]
*  a better place. So your trauma, and I believe it's trauma, I really do. I've watched your old stuff [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4726.8s)]
*  when you were young, talking about your life and your childhood, the trauma that you went through [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4732.96s)]
*  has not beaten you. It has made the world a better place. That's why people love you. And I don't [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4737.68s)]
*  think you would be who you are without the irony is you wouldn't be who you are without that, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4743.4400000000005s)]
*  that almost impossible thing to deal with, that, that thing that would break most people. And it, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4749.28s)]
*  you never let it, you just turned it into something very special. So that's my compliment. Those are [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4755.28s)]
*  my three compliments for Theo Vaughn. That's why I love you. Well, thank you, bro. Sweet of you to [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4760.719999999999s)]

*  just, you know, if you'll learn as much as you can, then you'll have so much, so many tools to be [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4806.48s)]
*  comedic from, you know, to even things now from growing up to recommending books, you know, just [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4813.36s)]
*  different things. If I'm going through like, yeah, sharing stuff, like different, you know, experiences [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4821.76s)]
*  from childhood trauma and wanting to like discuss that and needing some support, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4826.8s)]
*  you know, you actually like, even if it takes a day or something for you to call back or to get [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4832.56s)]
*  back when you do, you give some time that's real, that really feels valuable and important. And so [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4836.64s)]
*  I don't want to say thank you for that, man. It's really sweet of you. Because when I hear you, I [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4847.12s)]
*  hear somebody that it's like a voice that, like a male voice that's educated that I never, just, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4852.0s)]
*  and is like kind of educated, but also good at injecting it into the flow of [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4860.48s)]
*  immediate life. And so it's hard to do that. It's such a skill that so few people have. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4869.28s)]
*  So thank you. I'm lucky to be privileged to see some of that and to experience it firsthand. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=4876.48s)]

*  through this shit right now. Your grandparents are dying. Jim Brewer has this great bit now. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5057.68s)]
*  Grandmother's dying. It's like he's fucking impersonating a Nazi. I love him. I love, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5063.360000000001s)]
*  yeah. You know, as you get older, I'll tell you this, I'm a lot older than you and you get less [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5069.92s)]
*  sure of, of uh, any kind of a truth. Really? In a way. Now that's another thing I was going to ask [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5073.360000000001s)]
*  you. How does aging happen in your beliefs and in your thoughts? Like what starts to happen? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5080.16s)]
*  You know, I tend to become more, um, I tend to become more compassionate for people who have a [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5086.879999999999s)]
*  totally different point of view than I do. Right? Wow. So I'm, I'm a white straight male, right? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5095.5199999999995s)]
*  Fine. I'm not saying you have it easy if you're a white straight male. I'm not saying, but I'm [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5100.4s)]
*  saying that if I was a black woman, if I was, uh, if I was a native American from, or an indigenous [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5103.919999999999s)]
*  person, a first nation person from Winnipeg, if I was, uh, from a small Indian village in the [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5112.4s)]
*  south of India, I would have a very different point of view. That's true. On the world, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5118.5599999999995s)]
*  on what's right, on what's wrong, on what's fair, what's unfair, on what I was afraid of, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5125.679999999999s)]
*  what I wasn't afraid of. If I was a black man, for the most part, even if I had money, even if I was [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5131.92s)]
*  privileged with an education, if I drove by, I know this, if I was driving by two white cops, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5138.48s)]
*  okay, maybe not now, but certainly nine months ago, I would have turned my music down. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5145.599999999999s)]
*  I would have put my glasses on. I might have rolled my window down. Set my wallet on the [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5152.799999999999s)]
*  dashboard. Whatever it is, right? Right? Whatever it is. A little bit like the way we talk now about [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5157.2s)]
*  anything that's, that's considered politically incorrect. We're now aware that big tech might [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5162.5599999999995s)]
*  shut us off. Right. That was what it's like. That's what it was like always. So as I get older [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5167.84s)]
*  and I read more and I, and I try to take that perspective of, I don't know, it tends to make me [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5172.72s)]
*  a little bit more compassionate and a little less attached to my cognitive beliefs. Cause I know how [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5178.16s)]
*  my brain works. Right. It's from reading. My brain works like this. I'm an emotional creature. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5185.68s)]
*  So I have a set of beliefs that were given to me by people I love, like my mother and my father, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5190.88s)]
*  like the culture I come from and media, like what worked for me and media. Right. So I have a set of [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5197.36s)]
*  beliefs like this. And so what happens is when you have that set of beliefs, you're going to try to [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5202.799999999999s)]
*  find evidence to support your beliefs. So if you start talking about socialism, I'm automatically [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5207.92s)]
*  going to have an argument, right? Cause I'm a capitalist quote unquote, or I'm a free market [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5214.639999999999s)]
*  guy. Right. I'm a libertarian, but then I, then I'll read a book and I realized that a lot of the [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5218.88s)]
*  basis of what I'm making all my philosophy on is not necessarily grounded in evidence. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5225.28s)]
*  And that somebody over there who has a different point of view has something to offer me, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5231.12s)]
*  has something to enlighten me on. So this is a process. So I guess what I'm saying is that as [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5236.639999999999s)]
*  I get older, I realize I'm a work in progress. Don't be too attached to everything you believe. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5241.84s)]
*  I love that. Don't, don't be so sure that everything you know and believe is true. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5249.36s)]
*  Okay. That's really important and willing to change your mind based on evidence and be able [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5254.32s)]
*  to see the evidence when it's in front of you. Well, right. I agree with you, man. And I think [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5260.5599999999995s)]
*  a lot of, and I've even noticed some own life over the past nine months, over the past year, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5265.44s)]
*  I've gotten very, a lot of people are very stuck to their, what their, their beliefs, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5269.5199999999995s)]
*  because it's some of it's a safety mechanism. They feel attacked. They feel like they don't know. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5273.679999999999s)]
*  Cause the other side is building weaponry over there. Right. Yeah. Right. So yeah, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5278.32s)]
*  it's like you start to feel, and you feel like they're not doing that. So why do I have to, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5281.76s)]
*  you know, it's like, it's interesting how like a lot of that has flared up over the past year. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5287.6s)]
*  Well, there's a documentary on Netflix called crack and remember crack babies. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5294.56s)]
*  Okay. I know a guy that was all bullshit. That was all bullshit. There were no crack babies, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5301.280000000001s)]
*  crack, crack babies weren't born that way. Most of the time it was a woman, a woman who was [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5306.24s)]
*  doing drinking marijuana, but it wasn't that crack itself was creating a whole generation of [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5312.16s)]
*  kids who are addicted to cocaine. That's not, oh yeah. I never heard that. I just heard like [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5318.16s)]
*  if they had a real skinny baby and he had jewelry on, but yeah, but again, that's what I always [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5321.76s)]
*  heard again. You can, you can also add to that black baby. You can also add that black woman [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5328.400000000001s)]
*  giving birth to black baby. Right. So what happened with the crack epidemic? I said, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5333.360000000001s)]
*  your crack baby's born to a mother who's addicted to the crack. Now I promise you in every Americans, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5338.16s)]
*  every white Americans at the media and even movies like, like boys in the hood, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5345.5199999999995s)]
*  the woman was holding a baby and saying something like, I'll do whatever it takes to get my crack. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5353.2s)]
*  Right. It was a black woman. It was always demonizing a black woman. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5360.88s)]
*  This is true. So if you're a black woman in the hood, try to make ends meet. You can't afford to [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5365.120000000001s)]
*  leave a battle zone and you're trying to raise your kids and there's a thousand other things [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5369.6s)]
*  you're dealing with. And now that's going on in the media. You're being demonized. Right. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5374.0s)]
*  You know, so, so, so because that was the narrative, right? And so you'd have a very [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5379.68s)]
*  different perspective on America. Oh, I would have a total. If you were, if you were a black woman, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5384.240000000001s)]
*  especially living in the eighties and night, my generation, my generation, how the fuck wouldn't [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5388.400000000001s)]
*  you have a chip on your shoulder? Oh dude. Yeah. Look, I think about that a lot of times. I think [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5392.8s)]
*  sometimes there's a, people don't realize like I've talked to before about like Disney world, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5396.72s)]
*  like you'd see the, the advertising for Disney world and there was always white kids at Disney [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5401.76s)]
*  world. So if you're a black kid and you're watching that, how would you not feel like, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5405.84s)]
*  oh, this isn't even for me. You weren't represented in, in cartoons, anything. Well, but there's some [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5409.4400000000005s)]
*  stuff is that's, that's not entirely true. Like some of my favorite shows were black acted shows. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5414.72s)]
*  So like, you know, you had Sanford and son, you had in the heat of the night, which had a [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5420.72s)]
*  black characters in it. Some of my favorite, um, Althea Tibbs is one of my favorite characters [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5424.72s)]
*  ever from a, from a drama. You know, they had a lot of, uh, and what was the one, um, and I know [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5430.16s)]
*  I'm just saying the one, but there was a lot. There was the one with the cops. There was Cosby, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5436.56s)]
*  which was huge. That's huge. That did a lot. That was like, oh, look, there's a black family, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5440.64s)]
*  just like a white family. There's a black doctor. He's in my living room every day. You know, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5445.68s)]
*  that was that whole, that was that, that was an important show in that sense. But I could imagine, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5450.64s)]
*  yeah. But when I was growing up, there wasn't any black doctors in our town. No. So this is where I [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5454.4800000000005s)]
*  get, I get the, I get where black activists, where white, you know, activists, where woke people are [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5458.96s)]
*  coming from. If you actually look at the history of this country, just go back 20 years, 15 years. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5466.96s)]
*  See, I don't, I'm not liberal this way. I'm not like a woke person. I do like fair play though. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5474.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. I've always wanted fair play. If you show me where something's not fair, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5479.6s)]
*  I'm right there. I'm like, I got it. I get it. I get it. Oh man. I remember putting a Jesse Jackson [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5484.64s)]
*  sign out in front of our apartment growing up. Like I remember, um, I was a David Dukakis fan. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5490.8s)]
*  Like I really resonated with a lot of David Duke. Oh, I used to lift weights at David Duke. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5497.6s)]
*  Everybody knows that though. Yeah. You worked out with David Duke. Yeah. He shared a fence, dude. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5503.68s)]
*  He used to date the hottest chick at the seafood restaurant I worked at. Is that right? God. You, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5508.24s)]
*  you live near David Duke? She was hot. Yeah. Still, my folks still share a back fence. Not far from. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5513.2s)]
*  That's hilarious. David, they call him D Duke around the neighborhood. D Duke is a beautiful little, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5518.16s)]
*  uh, Pomeranian white. I won't say that, but yeah, that would make sense. Um, but yeah, there's just [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5524.5599999999995s)]
*  a lot to it, man. There's a lot to it. But yeah, to think that I think the part that gets me a lot [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5531.84s)]
*  of times it's people, it's, it's people have now become like, it's like people use the woke stuff [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5537.28s)]
*  for clout and it's not even about the argument anymore. And then I also start to see, I've always [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5543.12s)]
*  thought about like equality, fairness. I see a lot of like black supremacy, Jewish supremacy. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5548.0s)]
*  I see some people, uh, you know, um, Indian supremacy. I see a lot. I don't like privilege. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5554.0s)]
*  I don't like supremacy. Yeah. I don't like it. Anytime when people start to get stuff into [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5561.2s)]
*  supremacy, Marcellus Wiley was that that guy's name? He had a great quote about it a while back. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5565.76s)]
*  Um, that's the part where it starts to make me feel angry, bro. I don't like any type of [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5570.64s)]
*  supremacy, bro. Like, um, it just, because then it's not about everybody anymore. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5576.56s)]
*  Well, you're assigning something called group guilt. What you're doing is just saying that [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5582.4800000000005s)]
*  entire group is guilty. And if you do that, we know how that works out in history too. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5586.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5591.360000000001s)]
*  Because when you, when you assign guilt to an entire group, just for their color, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5591.84s)]
*  just for their gender, just for their, uh, so it's your economic background. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5597.84s)]
*  Yeah. Now, if you do that, just remember that you can, that's a double edged sword. You can [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5602.64s)]
*  turn that sword on the other group just as quickly. If you do that to that group, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5607.68s)]
*  when you're done with that group, you're next, you know, and, and so, and, and what happens is [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5612.16s)]
*  if you have group guilt, then you usually have to have a group that rectifies that guilt. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5616.8s)]
*  And one need only look at the world today, forget history and see how that works out for [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5624.8s)]
*  people who are assigned group guilt. They're killed, they're jailed, they're put in concentration [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5631.28s)]
*  camps. They're, they're quote unquote marginalized in the worst way possible. So let's all be careful [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5636.16s)]
*  about that shift. That's why that's the problem with identity politics. That's why I'm very [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5642.08s)]
*  now one thing I'm not on the fence on is I am very against identity politics. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5647.12s)]
*  I think it's fucking the worst. I don't even know what it is. It's the idea that you are, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5651.6s)]
*  you are, you are essentially breaking people up into their groups and you are assigning [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5656.88s)]
*  guilt or you are assigning victim hood to varying degrees, to different groups. I mean, that's, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5661.92s)]
*  that's what you do. And those groups that have traditionally been in a position of quote unquote [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5667.6s)]
*  supremacy or in a position of privilege have to take now a backseat or whatever, or are- [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5672.64s)]
*  Like give me an example. So I know what I'm- [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5678.64s)]
*  Well, well the idea behind identity politics would be, you know, we have, even when you start [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5680.56s)]
*  talking about the black vote versus the Asian vote versus the white vote, you're already [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5687.68s)]
*  creating groups. You're already saying that you're already creating a monolith. You're suggesting [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5692.96s)]
*  that black people think the same. Oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5697.68s)]
*  Like there are, that their opinions are- Yeah, it's hard not to do that. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5700.0s)]
*  Versus it gets. But also when you start doing that, when you start, when you start saying [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5702.16s)]
*  we need a quota, we need representation from this group, because this group has been left out, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5707.84s)]
*  you're playing a form of identity politics. Because when you do that, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5715.04s)]
*  when you, when you privilege one group over the other, or you start detracting just based on group, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5719.5199999999995s)]
*  not based on skill, based on biological attributes, you have to have an enforcing [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5728.08s)]
*  mechanism. You have to have someone at the top who has the power to make those decisions, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5735.44s)]
*  to enforce those decisions. That is a, that is a, that is something you must do through force. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5741.759999999999s)]
*  You must do at the end of the day, at the barrel of a gun. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5748.24s)]
*  Damn. Because that's what the state does. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5752.08s)]
*  If I say no, they say yes. If I really refuse to move, you get dragged out by officers of the law. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5754.48s)]
*  Right. They happen to have guns. At the end of the day, there's no way to do that without some form [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5762.719999999999s)]
*  of coercion, some form of force. When you do that, and you, and you, and you demonize one group, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5768.32s)]
*  or you start to say this group is a victim and this group has to pay for that, what happens is [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5775.759999999999s)]
*  you're going to push people, you're going to really push people into groups. What you're going [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5781.52s)]
*  to do is you're going to create the, the, the, America will become what a prison yard is, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5785.6s)]
*  what a state penitentiary becomes. Where you got the Aryan Brotherhood over here, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5791.52s)]
*  you got the Southern Mexicans, you got the Northern Mexicans, you got the Black, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5795.280000000001s)]
*  you got this whole thing over here. And all of a sudden you create, and now you're, now, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5798.56s)]
*  now the only consideration is color. And you have people that are so obsessed with color, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5802.64s)]
*  it's like they should be in art school. They should be in art school making, studying oil [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5808.72s)]
*  painting. Because that's the only criteria. And so it's a very, again, it's a very rudimentary, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5813.52s)]
*  very dangerous game to play. And I'm not nearly as articulate about this. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5819.52s)]
*  No, it's helpful for me. It's great though, because it's good because it's like, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5823.84s)]
*  yeah, this is good practice. Cause Jordan Peterson, it's like, damn, it's like somebody [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5828.0s)]
*  just beach in the face with a fucking library. He's been talking about this. You know, I did, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5831.68s)]
*  I did the first podcast with him. Really? Yeah. That's when Rogan called, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5835.28s)]
*  texted me and said, your podcast with Jordan Peterson was great. He had, he had just heard [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5838.96s)]
*  about him and I did this podcast. You and Jordan Peterson were on Rogan together? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5843.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I did the first podcast with him in our group. No way. And Rogan, Rogan then put him on. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5845.92s)]
*  Dang, that's crazy. Yeah. How about that? Wow. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5850.16s)]
*  Yeah, man. And it was so great. I love, I've done three podcasts with him, I think. So such an honor. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5855.2s)]
*  I love that guy. Yeah. I feel pretty excited. I'm trying to think of good questions, like just to [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5862.88s)]
*  ask and just things that I'm like thinking about and also things that I'm scared about. Yeah. I'm [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5866.64s)]
*  gonna read the book, but also just things that like, I'm just worried about and, or just like, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5870.240000000001s)]
*  just looking for sometimes guidance, you know, sometimes when you get someone that has more [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5875.68s)]
*  experience, what I like to try to do sometimes is get some guidance. So how do we, how do we stay [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5879.92s)]
*  away from identity politics and stuff like that? What can we do and how do we stay funny? What can [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5883.92s)]
*  we do to stay funny in a time like this? You have to fight back. You have to, you have to [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5888.16s)]
*  recognize, first of all, where identity politics came from. You have to recognize, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5893.92s)]
*  you have to recognize what the other side that pushes that stuff is trying to do. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5899.76s)]
*  You have to have, you have to have better ideas. You have to remember that what has worked for the [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5904.96s)]
*  most part with the West and what other countries have not done is that they treat people as [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5911.36s)]
*  individuals. Okay. You treat everyone as an individual. You treat when someone comes in [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5917.839999999999s)]
*  for a job, whether they are trans, whether they are black, whether they are Native American, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5923.28s)]
*  whether they are straight white guy, India, I want to see what you can do. Let me, let me try. And [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5927.12s)]
*  it's very, and what they'll tell you is there's unconscious bias. Okay. So they say if you're [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5933.28s)]
*  white, you're unconsciously going to be biased towards someone who's white. Okay. Fine. That's [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5937.44s)]
*  true. I don't either, but, but, but this is the new thing. So you have anti-bias training. Here's [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5941.599999999999s)]
*  the problem with anti-bias training. Here's the biggest problem. So the idea is you have some [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5946.24s)]
*  expert who's taking some classes in the humanities and, and, you know, and they come in and they [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5949.839999999999s)]
*  apparently are the experts on how to teach you about your unconscious bias. Okay. The idea then [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5955.599999999999s)]
*  would be you take a class and now you don't have, either you don't have unconscious bias or you're [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5960.48s)]
*  aware that you have unconscious bias. Okay. Okay. All good. The problem is you'll never take [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5964.88s)]
*  unconscious bias out of a human being. And by the way, unconscious bias is very important and a very [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5969.28s)]
*  good thing most of the time. Or some of the time. Why? If somebody has shifty eyes and clammy hands, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5974.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not fucking loaning you money or I'm not going to hire you for the job because you're sketchy. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5980.72s)]
*  I can't explain why, but you give my gut, you give my gut, my intuition, the notion that you [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5986.16s)]
*  ain't no good. And I need that because that's how I keep my money. That's how I keep safe. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5993.36s)]
*  That's how I keep my family safe. Yeah. Well, that's how women keep from fucking, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=5998.88s)]
*  keep, stay, stay safe. When they see a guy who's something, something's over there. So my mother [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6002.639999999999s)]
*  told me that one time she goes, there was a guy and the way he was standing, I knew he was, he [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6007.2s)]
*  was looking to get, jump me. I knew he was looking to rape me. Oh yeah. And so my mother was like, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6011.28s)]
*  she just, she got a bad feeling and turned and walked the other way and blah, blah, blah. So, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6015.36s)]
*  we need our unconscious bias. Yeah. You can't walk into a dark alley filled with people like bad wolves [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6020.879999999999s)]
*  and just be like, maybe they're good wolves. You know, the guy at the, at the, at the meeting said, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6027.599999999999s)]
*  maybe they're good wolves. Give them a chance. One of them is loading a gun and chiseling your name [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6032.48s)]
*  into the side of it. This is where critical race theory comes in. This is the, this is all comes out [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6037.36s)]
*  of the same idea. That's not enough to be not racist. You have to be actually actively tearing [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6042.24s)]
*  down the institutions that have given us the longest standing democracy in the history of the [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6047.36s)]
*  world. You got to start tearing down institutions. I grew up around nuclear family. Apparently is bad [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6052.719999999999s)]
*  now. Yeah, that's insane. And that's what's causing a lot. I mean, a lot of it is people don't have [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6057.839999999999s)]
*  any faith anymore. There's nothing. There's nowhere to turn. We could go in all of it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6061.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's, it's being talked about at least. And even, even a couple of knuckleheads like us are [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6066.639999999999s)]
*  actually talking about it. Let's get back to common. I wanted to get into something funny. I fucked up. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6070.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, it's all good. This could be funny. I don't know. Okay. Here's a guy right here. And [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6074.88s)]
*  this guy might be black, might be white. This dude might be Jehovah's witnesses. He's a composite man. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6079.36s)]
*  What up Theo, Brian, bright guy, the original kid, Callan. Yeah, yeah, right. We just all want to [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6085.6s)]
*  know probably, um, you spent a lot of time away. We all be personally missed you. I'm sure a lot of [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6094.24s)]
*  other people did too. And I think we're just all really curious. Like what did you do during that [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6101.28s)]
*  time? Like I, uh, give us an update. I think we're all really wanting to know how you spent that time [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6106.24s)]
*  and gang. Yeah. What have you been doing, Ryan? Great question. Starting a podcast with Steve [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6114.639999999999s)]
*  Byrne, big and hungry, hungry. Yeah. Which I was on. Yes, you were. Which is awesome drops every [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6119.5199999999995s)]
*  Monday. When's our episode coming out? Uh, I think, I think this Monday and it's fucking hilarious. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6124.8s)]
*  Okay. Killed it. Cool. Cool. And then we got me on. Yep. That's big and hungry. Anywhere you find [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6130.8s)]
*  podcasts. Uh, been doing the conspiracy social club with Sam Tripoli twice a week. And that's [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6135.4400000000005s)]
*  been interesting because now we might have to move over to another platform. Rockfin because we too [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6141.360000000001s)]
*  hot. We too hot. Too hot for Vimeo. But that's good. Maybe something like Rockfin starts up. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6146.0s)]
*  I wish we would all start our own platform, but yeah, you know, and I just kept, you know, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6151.68s)]
*  I was dealing with a lot of shit. So I just kept, I worked out every day and I just, did you? Yeah. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6156.4800000000005s)]
*  And I just tried to become a better father. And, uh, you know, I was, I was going through a divorce, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6160.24s)]
*  but that, that ended very amicably because me and my ex get along really well. And we, we, uh, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6165.5199999999995s)]
*  we raised the kids together and, and we didn't need like, uh, we didn't need courts and you know, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6170.8s)]
*  we needed, we needed, we did some lawyer stuff just to, cause it's detailed. But other than that, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6175.76s)]
*  we were, we, we, we did it great. And I'm proud of that. And I'm proud of her for that. We, we, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6180.16s)]
*  ended it really, really well. And cause the kids are our priority. And then, uh, and then I don't [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6185.36s)]
*  know, man, I just fucking brushed up on my kung fu. Did you? Yeah, dude. There's something about [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6190.64s)]
*  that staying physically active. How important was that man? It's called communicating with your body. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6195.68s)]
*  That's what you do. So when you do a sport or you do anything, you're communicating with your body. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6202.24s)]
*  You, you, you know, it only gets harder as you get older. But that's almost the point, like [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6206.96s)]

*  some of that learning in jujitsu, it takes like the anger that's inside of me. It takes it out [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6324.16s)]
*  of my body to be trapped by another man or young woman and not have any fucking recourse except to [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6328.16s)]
*  scream into the fucking abyss as they're, as they're imposing their will on you of a fucking gym where [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6335.28s)]

*  readjust your neural pathways and stuff. It's like doing LSD, man. All of a sudden you're going to be [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6357.2s)]
*  thinking about shit differently. Like you're just not comfortable. Yeah. Being comfortable. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6362.08s)]
*  Comfort might be the wolf at the door. Comfort. Look, we've said it on this podcast before. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6366.0s)]
*  Comfort will be your coffin, man. It really will. And it's crazy to think that. Yeah, it is. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6371.52s)]
*  It really is. And before we go, yeah, like I was a little bit nervous about having you on [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6375.52s)]
*  just because I know you kind of been through a lot over the past year. Has it been tough to like, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6379.92s)]
*  um, has it been, what's it been like for you, man? Terrible. Has it been? Yeah, the worst. Yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6386.080000000001s)]
*  Because you can't fight back. There's nothing you can do just the way it is. And like, you know, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6392.320000000001s)]
*  it's very interesting because you get ready for whatever come what may in life, right? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6397.76s)]
*  And then something comes along that you don't even know how to fight against. How the fuck do [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6402.56s)]
*  you fight something like that? How do you do, how, how in the world do you, when you never in a [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6405.76s)]
*  million years thought something like that would happen in a million years, cause you've tried to [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6410.72s)]
*  live your life the best, you know, right. Helping everybody. And I don't know, I can just only, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6413.84s)]
*  I'm not spiritual enough, but you got to just kind of figure out how to pivot, but it's real [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6420.64s)]
*  and it's got lasting consequences and it's, it's true destruction. But the question is, who are you [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6425.84s)]
*  in destruction? Who are you when chaos hits? Who are you when everything is taken from you [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6431.759999999999s)]
*  that you've built over 30 years? And, um, I don't know, but I'm finding out, you know, at least I'm [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6437.599999999999s)]
*  tough. At least I know who the fuck I am. And, and, and, and, you know, that's the other thing. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6443.679999999999s)]
*  I've talked to people who've been through this and one of, one of a dear friend of mine said, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6447.84s)]
*  the good news is you know who you are and you know what you've done and you sure as fuck know what [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6452.400000000001s)]
*  you haven't done. And that's what's kept me going. That's why I keep moving. That's why I'm not [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6456.72s)]
*  quiet about things because I know who I am and good person. And I've done everything I can to [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6463.280000000001s)]
*  try to make the world a better place. And I'll keep doing that. The biggest thing is not letting it [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6470.320000000001s)]
*  take the funny away from you. That's a motherfucker. My biggest accomplishment has been, I wrote a [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6474.56s)]
*  whole hour in this insanity and I was funny and I did a good fucking job and I'll keep doing that. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6479.12s)]
*  You know, that's, that's been, you know, when you can suffer well, suffer well, suffer with dignity [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6484.88s)]
*  and suffer productively and criticize by creating, keep criticizing by creating. Don't criticize by [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6491.599999999999s)]
*  complaining. Don't criticize by, you know, well, this person did that to me. That's always going [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6498.72s)]
*  to exist. I just got hit. Okay. Now what? That's good for me to hear, man, because I do that sometimes [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6503.28s)]
*  I'll fall, especially in this past year. And I think a lot of us have, we've fallen into the [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6508.88s)]
*  complaint and the fear and this, the outbursts and the speak, but yet to be able to stay creative. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6512.64s)]
*  That's it, man. Was there ever did, has there ever been any like actual court case or anything [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6518.4800000000005s)]
*  that's followed up from the accusations? No, not at all. Okay. Not at all. And, uh, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6523.68s)]
*  because you're talking about an accusation that was, is 21 years old, dude. This is somebody, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6529.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't want to get into the details, but this is somebody that- [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6535.599999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And I'm not trying to get you into it. I just wanted to know- [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6537.92s)]
*  This is somebody I, I mean, it's insane. I don't know what happened and I'm not interested in [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6540.08s)]
*  speculating on that. Um, but there was never like a, there hasn't been like a court case. There's [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6547.28s)]
*  not like a- No, no, because absolutely not. Right. Well, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6552.0s)]
*  that's two things. There's one thing- First of all, ready for this? I didn't do it. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6556.48s)]
*  Right. Right. There's, there's always that. The good news is I didn't do it. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6559.44s)]
*  Right. And that's, that's, and I mean, you know, I, I'm always hesitant to say this, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6563.76s)]
*  but the number of women, and I put it in a drop box and I sent it to my lawyer and my, my publicist, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6567.599999999999s)]
*  the number of women that have been in my life over the past 25 years that reached out without me [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6575.36s)]
*  doing anything. One of, a couple of them are high profile who've gone through this stuff with Harvey [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6580.88s)]
*  Weinstein. Wow. The number of women that actually reached out to me and said, I can't believe this [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6586.0s)]
*  is happening to you was so heartening to me. I put them all, all the texts, these people I hadn't [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6590.96s)]
*  heard from for 10 years, 15 years. When you hear from that many people and you know, I put it all [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6598.08s)]
*  in, I have it all saved. I have it all saved. I have it all saved. It's pretty devastating. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6606.32s)]
*  It's pretty cool to have that many people that you never even reached out to reach out to you. Then [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6612.4s)]
*  you have some people you haven't talked to in 10 and 15 years. And say, Hey, you were a good guy. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6619.36s)]
*  Like, I can't believe this is happening to you in a, and I'll be a witness for you. You know, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6624.48s)]
*  that's like, you know, that's, that's, that's what I hold onto those kinds of things. But sometimes [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6628.719999999999s)]
*  when somebody writes an article, it never goes away. They just, you know, your reputation in [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6633.44s)]
*  many ways is destroyed in certain circles, circles, or, or it shuts off your ability to do anything in [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6639.04s)]
*  certain facets. And so, okay, that happened. Now what? Now what? Let's move forward. But I'm [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6646.56s)]
*  never going to shy from it. I'm never shy from it. And I'm never going to hide. And I'm never going [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6654.72s)]
*  to put my head down because I know who I am. And I know the truth. And that's, and Jordan Peterson [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6659.52s)]
*  says in chaos, all you can do is tell the truth. And you know, and that's what I said to my fucking, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6665.120000000001s)]
*  the first thing I said to my lawyer and my publicist, I go, I need to know that you guys know [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6669.92s)]
*  that I'm innocent. I don't want, I'm not, I don't want a hired gun. I don't want anybody who doesn't [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6675.679999999999s)]
*  believe fully that, that this is, you know, and so I provided them with the evidence, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6680.88s)]
*  but that's okay. Well, I'm sorry for not being brave, like just trying to be braver to be more [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6686.4s)]
*  supportive. I thought your job that this is a very scary time. So I'll stop you right there. This is [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6690.48s)]
*  a very scary time for everybody because if they can come for me, they can come for anybody. Well, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6695.2s)]
*  I just wanted to be able to, at least to be able to have a place where people can be heard, whatever [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6698.88s)]
*  they're to have a discussion or just to be, to be heard about like, yeah, just felt like you'd never [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6703.84s)]
*  even had a chance to be heard in some ways. You're not, you're not, you know, it's, it's just, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6710.96s)]
*  it's, it's, we have built a world where due process doesn't exist. We have built a world [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6716.400000000001s)]
*  where like it or not, and there's arguments on both sides where allegations alone ruin everything, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6722.32s)]
*  allegations alone destroy your life. And that's a fact. And, and you know, I always, I really [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6729.76s)]
*  want to be man. Well, it's, it's, it's not good for anyone. Not fucking Halloween, man. Not for [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6735.84s)]
*  your brother, not for your father, not for your friend. It ain't. And again, I always say this, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6742.08s)]
*  you know, if you want to build a world like that, where there's no due process, where the court of [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6747.12s)]
*  public opinion can destroy your ability to feed your children, you're next. Yeah, I always say that. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6751.04s)]
*  So, you know, Oh, yeah, I just don't see how that ends. I don't see how that that ends. Well, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6757.36s)]
*  well, it just gives all the power to one side. And that's an imbalance of power is never good. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6763.679999999999s)]
*  So we're trying to figure it out. We're all trying to figure it out. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6768.639999999999s)]
*  We appreciate you being here today, man, and making me feel, you know, and just, you know, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme1O7K3mpU&t=6772.4s)]
