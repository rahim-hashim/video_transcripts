*  You know, especially during like a lot of the I guess election stuff and then especially during like be it when BLM really went off [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=655.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because I used to like we're all in the same team. We're all trying to do our best and everybody [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=663.82s)]
*  You know, this is what we're doing. This is like America and it's just like Howard, you know, we're trying our best [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=670.22s)]

*  Some some of the BLM stuff to me almost felt like a like supremacy like it wasn't like about [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=682.74s)]
*  Everybody anymore like it wasn't and it wasn't even just about black people. It was just like [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=688.38s)]

*  I think it always had been so to me. I was just like well [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=718.28s)]
*  If and in some points and this is just me as a white person, right? Yeah, it almost felt like [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=721.74s)]
*  Attack on me, but it felt like it didn't feel like there was a safe place for you to go if you were somebody [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=728.74s)]
*  Who's like well, I've always right [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=734.04s)]

*  Right, so when everybody's like they matter you're like, yeah [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=756.0s)]

*  Yeah, why it does feel like that a little bit I guess which I [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=817.3s)]
*  Everybody can have their own thing. The internet is big and vast and it's got room for everybody [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=822.02s)]
*  But when people start attacking [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=826.34s)]

*  Primarily black neighborhoods [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=894.5400000000001s)]
*  Just curious. What was the best part about being one of the only white kids? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=896.9000000000001s)]

*  well, just in comparison I'd go to my friend Eddie's house and it was just like [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=921.22s)]
*  Shit, I'd never seen before like weird brands and bags of cereal, right? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=925.88s)]

*  Gizzards or whatever the fuck that is, but no, but I'm saying what like I think his question is like what do you think was? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=935.26s)]
*  What was it? What was interesting about it? He's always the one of the perks of being the one of the white kids. I [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=942.74s)]
*  Showed a lot of kids had a skateboard [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=949.22s)]
*  Okay, so there you go. I think that would be a real perk. So you had better snacks. Yeah, I think so [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=952.62s)]
*  So yeah, you got to show kids how to skateboard [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=958.38s)]

*  This black kid would come over and play our Nintendo. He was unbelievable [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=967.38s)]
*  It was like something I'd never seen and me and my brother were like in awe of this kid. He would just [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=970.5s)]
*  Go to town on that Nintendo with Mario. He could jump up [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=975.98s)]
*  Remember when you had to jump on the flagpole at the end of Mario and slide he could get to the top [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=979.94s)]
*  Oh wow, yeah [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=984.34s)]

*  That's what I heard anyway [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=990.7800000000001s)]
*  Did you hear that growing up in Louisiana that black people have extra muscles in their body quick twitch? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=991.9s)]

*  So you could be like a liaison at times [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  At least you got a little bit of like more respect if you were like talking to the black kids [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1033.94s)]
*  You could be over there you could kind of joke around you could have a little bit more [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1039.1s)]
*  Room with the black kids. Mm-hmm. Um, I was the other kid that was on Tom's brother was liaison. Yeah [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1043.9399999999998s)]

*  It was a little tougher. You got to all my means sometimes you got to even see you [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1072.18s)]

*  This is back when you could kind of do I mean you couldn't you weren't so but it was just a moment [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1230.7s)]
*  It's like that's one thing about comedy though [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1235.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's like there's times where it's like if you it used to be anyway if you felt a certain thing [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1237.42s)]
*  Yep, and you could trust that instinct. It was real scary [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1243.26s)]
*  Oh, so true. It was it was like somebody fucking it's almost like Satan lit a little fuse in the distance [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1247.22s)]
*  And you just start to see it [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1253.34s)]
*  Frickin boiling that's so and that would happen every now and then cuz hitting on a girl is so scary [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1256.06s)]
*  I'm I'm with a lady now, but in the single days [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1260.74s)]
*  Every now and then you get that devil's spark right in the taint and it would just work with a girl [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1265.18s)]
*  You had the ball to the confidence and she ate it up and then sometimes it fell flat [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1270.66s)]
*  But it's the same thing with comedy every now and then you get that little twinkle of jizz in your eye and it just works [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1274.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=1280.1399999999999s)]

*  I can use this this is gonna be perfect. You know, let's get this uh [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4518.98s)]
*  Let's get this question right here that came in from Jack Harlow [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4523.46s)]
*  Harlow good name Jack Harlow. Yeah [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4527.7s)]
*  What's up, Theo? What's up, Mark? My name is Tyler from Texas [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4531.34s)]
*  So there was this HBO show called talking funny [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4536.36s)]
*  Bass Jerry Seinfeld Chris Rock and Louis CK where they sat down for like an hour-long discussion or whatever and [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4540.12s)]
*  Part of that they were talking about their different methods for building an hour [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4547.2s)]
*  For their act or whether maybe it's gonna become a special or whatever and Jerry Seinfeld [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4551.8s)]
*  Took the approach of like you take about 20% remove it and cycling your new stuff that way [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4557.16s)]
*  And so over time your act is this like ever-evolving piece [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4562.34s)]
*  I [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4565.88s)]
*  Got to see mark a couple months ago and I kind of noticed something similar with his material where it's like there's definitely like [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4567.4800000000005s)]
*  staple jokes of yours [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4574.84s)]
*  as well as like you trying in the new stuff and [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4577.04s)]
*  This great step by the way, I was curious [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4580.0s)]
*  Is that something that you picked up from Seinfeld that kind of method of removing a little bit of the old to push in the new? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4582.2s)]
*  Or you know, what's your general method for building an hour? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4588.2s)]
*  same question Theo [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4592.64s)]
*  Thanks guys, yeah, maybe I'll let mark answer it. Thank you taller for the for the question man for paying attention to the show [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4594.96s)]
*  What do you think more? Well, first of all, I can't believe anybody cares about stand-up who doesn't do it [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4600.280000000001s)]
*  Which is it's I always assume when we go into stand-up people get bored. Yeah, but maybe not maybe not this guy's uh, you know [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4604.320000000001s)]
*  at Comic Con apparently but [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4610.76s)]
*  Yeah, I I think he nailed it. It's just kind of the natural progression [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4614.04s)]
*  You got your pillars like I'll do the the plant joke and then I'll do the the car joke and these murder every time [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4618.76s)]
*  So you you kind of pepper those in like M&Ms and trail mix like oh, that's the good stuff [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4625.38s)]
*  And then you try your new and you got your your half-baked idea [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4630.56s)]
*  And then when you start losing them hit them with another M&M [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4635.6s)]
*  Yeah, and then you close with a big M&M at the end [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4638.52s)]
*  But yeah, eventually in natural progression it will then the new stuff will grow and be great [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4641.320000000001s)]
*  And then you can just start letting go of those M&M's [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4647.4s)]
*  Yeah, just fluff off and then you got a new hour, but it takes a while [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4649.74s)]
*  Yeah, it takes a while. It takes a while and I think that's one thing that's scary about putting stuff out [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4654.5599999999995s)]
*  I think like I got this special coming out and I think a week and a half or something [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4659.48s)]
*  But I'm also as long as I wish like man [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4663.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the true value would have been in not putting it out at all and just touring forever just toward not just with that [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4666.16s)]
*  Material change my material but not having like these definitive moments where I have to change it the Jay Leno method [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4672.6s)]
*  He never put an album out because he was like I want to keep this [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4679.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, which I don't know [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4682.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe there's good good and bads to both like if you put this out, it'll force you to write new shit [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4685.120000000001s)]
*  Which is like but you have to do it [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4689.660000000001s)]
*  But if you don't put it out, you can just kind of do it forever and there's no sometimes we need a deadline as comedians [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4692.0s)]
*  We're a bunch of lazy cucks. Yeah, we are kind of huh. I [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4696.92s)]
*  Think we can get lazy if we would get lazy because we knew we're capable of making things happen at the last minute [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4700.96s)]
*  Exactly. He's had that book report man. You would like that fucking thing dude [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4706.36s)]
*  Wing it brother one time it was about I don't even know what it was about [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4710.4s)]
*  but I remember taking a bunch of stuff out of our kitchen and putting it in a bowl and then putting like this like [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4713.92s)]
*  Something on top of it. You had to put your hand in there and reach in and grab it was like [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4718.72s)]
*  Ha literally did it in the morning before school didn't make any sense [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4721.96s)]

*  And fond it also went to our school to fund it [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4730.96s)]
*  Bayham that was a girl that went to our school [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4734.719999999999s)]

*  Oh, yeah, we had some great ones, but then the last name would be kind of normal. It would be like [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4741.92s)]
*  Latrine Williams. Yeah, you know Bayham Washington Wilson. Yes all presidential. Yeah [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2nSwakGlE&t=4746.719999999999s)]
