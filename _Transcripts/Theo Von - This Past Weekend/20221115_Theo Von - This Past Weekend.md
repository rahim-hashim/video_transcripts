*  We're going to learn a little bit about that today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=130.0s)]
*  I'm grateful to get to spend time with him, Mr. Dana Carvey. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=132.0s)]
*  Well, the worst thing you can do is say to yourself, I wonder if I'll get an election. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=170.0s)]
*  The whole idea of sex is not thinking. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=172.0s)]
*  And all you have to do is concentrate on turning yourself on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=176.0s)]
*  Because they asked me that once on a podcast. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=181.0s)]
*  They go, how do you turn someone on? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=183.0s)]
*  You go, turn yourself on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=185.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=187.0s)]
*  True. Focus on that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I like, yeah, I mean, I've had probably libido issues since I was probably, I would bet eight or nine months old. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=191.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=198.0s)]
*  Well, but you're, okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=199.0s)]
*  I don't know when your libido is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=201.0s)]
*  Well, you don't have a libido until you go through puberty, really. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=203.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=205.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=206.0s)]
*  I mean, who has a libido when they're in diapers? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=207.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=210.0s)]
*  But, you know. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=212.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=213.0s)]
*  I have to look at some pictures and see what was going on back then. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=214.0s)]
*  But yeah, I felt like, I don't know when that libido starts cranking up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=217.0s)]
*  Well, it's normally, I'll just play doctor. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=223.0s)]
*  When puberty happens is when libido kicks up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=226.0s)]
*  I'm going to say that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=230.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=232.0s)]
*  We had a party in our neighborhood. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=233.0s)]
*  This guy had, he was an Elvis impersonator, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=234.0s)]
*  And he had a party for his child whenever he went through puberty, I remember. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=236.0s)]
*  And we went over there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=240.0s)]
*  Well, that's kind of like a bar mitzvah kind of, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=241.0s)]
*  I guess. I don't know. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=243.0s)]
*  I'd never, I'd never been anything like that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=244.0s)]
*  I think it was like some part of, I don't know if it was like a church program or whatever, but yeah, this fella got all pubescent or whatever. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=246.0s)]
*  And so they invited everybody over there for cake or whatever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=252.0s)]
*  When I turned 13, my dad headbutt me and I saw stars. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah. You think you're a man. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=258.0s)]
*  But another guy's a girl. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=260.0s)]
*  That's the same thing, bro. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=264.0s)]
*  I tell everybody, Mike Myers always said the one movie had was a headbutt. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=267.0s)]
*  And you always come up slow. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=271.0s)]
*  If you know there's going to be a fight, like, what's up? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=273.0s)]
*  We got to have peace. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=274.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=275.0s)]
*  And then you really is efficient. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=276.0s)]
*  Didn't you have that in Louisiana? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=277.0s)]
*  A move? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=279.0s)]
*  Headbutts. The sudden friendly one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=280.0s)]
*  I don't know, Jed, we should get along. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=282.0s)]
*  We can share the fishing hole. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=285.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=287.0s)]
*  I don't know where you grew up. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=289.0s)]
*  I know it's down in that area of the world. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think a good headbutt was a good move. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=293.0s)]
*  Oh, Mace I think was popular by us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=296.0s)]
*  Are you a little warmed in now? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, no, I'm not. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=301.0s)]
*  This is for Arctic weather, but I just want to keep the blue around me because it's hip. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=302.0s)]
*  I'm liking a little cozy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe how good I look today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=308.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=310.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=312.0s)]
*  Some days you crack up, you wake up, you're like, okay, today's going to be an okay looking day. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=313.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=317.0s)]
*  Well, if I go back, I still think that a man, Lorne Michaels said once, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=318.0s)]
*  something about a man in his 40s and a woman in their 20s. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=323.0s)]
*  They're both at the peak of their power. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=327.0s)]
*  So you're just coming into your peak sex symbol. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=330.0s)]
*  You're successful. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=333.0s)]
*  You're in your 40s. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=334.0s)]
*  Now you go start to look at 20, 21, 22. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=335.0s)]
*  I'll keep going with 23, 24. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=341.0s)]
*  But yeah, you're in your prime. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=344.0s)]
*  But I remember someone saying that to me. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=345.0s)]
*  I had this guy my age doing my hair on some kind of movie. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=347.0s)]
*  And he goes, I go, I'm 38, you know, and he goes, oh, you're in your prime. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=350.0s)]
*  That fucker was right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=355.0s)]
*  Was he? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=356.0s)]
*  No, but I'm in my prime now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=358.0s)]
*  Hey, yeah, the prime, I guess. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=359.0s)]
*  I'm Johnny positive. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=360.0s)]
*  The prime has to keep moving, huh? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=362.0s)]
*  You have to keep the prime moving, don't you? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=365.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=367.0s)]
*  If you didn't age or get older, then we'd be in some kind of hellish environment. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=368.0s)]
*  You think? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=373.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got to check out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=374.0s)]
*  We got to have an expiration date. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=375.0s)]
*  It makes everything intense. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=376.0s)]
*  What if you lived a million years? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=378.0s)]
*  You just like, what would you do? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=380.0s)]
*  I mean, you would definitely probably call in, you know, you'd show up late to work more. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=382.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=388.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I've always wanted to play the saxophone because my parents, I got picked [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=390.0s)]
*  to play the saxophone in fifth grade, but it was $7 a month. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=395.0s)]
*  And I kept coming to school. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=399.0s)]
*  It's expensive. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=401.0s)]
*  And they said, they said, where's your saxophone? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=402.0s)]
*  So I go, I'll have it tomorrow. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=404.0s)]
*  And at one point, I think my mom said, you know, we can't afford the saxophone. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=406.0s)]
*  So if I lived a million years, I would spend at least 10,000 years practicing the saxophone. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=410.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=416.0s)]
*  Bro, you'd be so good then. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=417.0s)]
*  You'd be able to play for the king. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=419.0s)]
*  No, I don't think that's my skill set, but I like to bang on things and strum things. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=421.0s)]
*  Did you have an instrument as a child? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=426.0s)]
*  Was there something you got kind of early that they gave you? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=428.0s)]
*  Usually a parent will give a child something, give them a horn, give them a little, you know, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=430.0s)]
*  some of you see people give them a Moroccan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=435.0s)]
*  That came later. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=437.0s)]
*  But first, my brother and I saw the Beach Boys. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=439.0s)]
*  We had a band called the Surfers. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=442.0s)]
*  So we had the clothes hamper and I was a crayon. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=444.0s)]
*  We wrote the Surfers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=447.0s)]
*  He got a one string guitar. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=448.0s)]
*  He could play Louie Louie for a buck. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=450.0s)]
*  And I would kick the clothes hamper for my kick drum. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=452.0s)]
*  And then I had a Hardy Boys book for my snare. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=455.0s)]
*  And the two drumsticks we stole from Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, his store in the 1960s, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=458.0s)]
*  because we were huge juvenile delinquents. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=464.0s)]
*  And then I met him 30 years later and I didn't know if it was true. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=466.0s)]
*  He goes, did you own a music store on Laurel Avenue in San Carlos? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=470.0s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=472.0s)]
*  I go, I think I shoplifted there. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=474.0s)]
*  I handed him a 20. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=476.0s)]
*  But I had that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=477.0s)]
*  And then I got a Big Bash snare drum in sixth grade. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=478.0s)]
*  Plastic. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=481.0s)]
*  But I had a muscly cousin who came down and just beat, killed it in a day. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=482.0s)]
*  And why did he do it? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=486.0s)]
*  He just was angry that you were going to try to learn it? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=487.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=489.0s)]
*  He was one of those muscly kids. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=490.0s)]
*  He's like a sixth grader, Jay Winters. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=491.0s)]
*  He just was muscly. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=493.0s)]
*  Every time you visited him, he'd crouch like he was going to wrestle you. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=494.0s)]
*  You know, one of those cousins. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=498.0s)]
*  Like, I don't want to wrestle you, dude. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=500.0s)]
*  So he broke the Big Bash. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=501.0s)]
*  But do you remember what toy blew your mind? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=503.0s)]
*  Because I always ask people this. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=506.0s)]
*  This is what I say, the Big Three from five to 12. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=508.0s)]
*  Movie or TV show where you went, holy shit. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=511.0s)]
*  Toy you had where you went, holy shit. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=513.0s)]
*  And then a bike where you felt like an adventurer. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=516.0s)]
*  The bike, you know. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=519.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the bike was, it had those spoke things, those little dinks, those little dinks. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=521.0s)]
*  Whenever the wheel turned, like the little thing would slide down a little. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=528.0s)]
*  It had like a little, you know, a thing that they used to count if you can't count real good and you slide it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=531.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. So it had like a little ticker thing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=537.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=539.0s)]
*  Something like a little, like these little, can you pull it up, Zach? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=540.0s)]
*  Abacus? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=544.0s)]
*  No, can you pull up what I'm talking about? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=545.0s)]
*  Just like the spoke. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=546.0s)]
*  Because we would do a clothespin and playing cards to get the motor self. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=547.0s)]
*  That's fire. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=550.0s)]
*  You did that too, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=551.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got to up-sold some garbage a little deal, but it would tink. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=552.0s)]
*  And then this hot girl sometimes would ride on it with me, you know. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=556.0s)]
*  Or not that hot, but like, you know, she like lived near me, which was hot back then, you know. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=559.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=563.0s)]
*  Dude, if a girl lived far, and if you could throw something and hit a girl, damn, she was fine, wasn't she? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=564.0s)]
*  When you were growing up. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=569.0s)]
*  I would say third grade, yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=570.0s)]
*  Did you ever drop your pencil so you had to pick it up and then you'd look behind you and the girl, you could see the girl's skirt? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=573.0s)]
*  Oh, drop it so she would get it? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=581.0s)]
*  No, drop it so you have an excuse to reach down and look back where the girl you like is sitting. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=583.0s)]
*  Dude, I was erect from probably... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=588.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, you had no libido. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=590.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if I did or not. I might have been all libido. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=592.0s)]
*  But I was erect probably from, yeah, I can't even imagine. I think from probably fifth grade to probably 31. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=594.0s)]
*  Did you ever have like in grade school, like, okay, and you're just full bloom, you're just fantasizing, you're in a zone, you're not paying attention. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=602.0s)]
*  They go, Theo, come to the chalkboard. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=610.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=612.0s)]
*  Come to the chalkboard right now. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=613.0s)]
*  And you had a full erection? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=615.0s)]
*  Dude, what did you do about that? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=617.0s)]
*  Joust. I would joust the other guy passing me in the aisle. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=618.0s)]
*  That's what I would do. Everybody was erect, man. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=621.0s)]
*  The whole classroom. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=624.0s)]
*  Oh, it was a bunch of like those tarpons passing each other in the water in middle school and junior high. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=626.0s)]
*  Every like, I feel like you just didn't want to get snagged on somebody's freaking pants now when you're walking down the hall. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=633.0s)]
*  I remember sometimes I would have my strap hanging off my back and we'd get hooked on somebody else's penis. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=640.0s)]
*  You know, because in junior high, every kid is just so damn erect, bro. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=645.0s)]
*  It's just like, you know, people just, they can't handle it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=649.0s)]
*  You know, you get that front rudder on you and you can't handle it as a child. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=653.0s)]
*  But I remember this hot girl got her toe caught in my bike. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=656.0s)]
*  We had to take her to the like, I don't know if it was emergency room or just just somebody close by that had damn thread on them, you know, when we took her over there. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=659.0s)]
*  And I remember. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=668.0s)]
*  Damn thread? You mean just cool clothes? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=669.0s)]
*  Oh, no, like just like could knit knit or, you know, spruce splice her toe back up. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=672.0s)]
*  Oh, and so I remember she got man, she got she got pretty mangled up and she had a limp after that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=677.0s)]
*  And I would limp with it because she was always trying to run away from me. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=684.0s)]
*  So after that, it was kind of good because it kind of, you know, gave me a chance to talk. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=687.0s)]
*  So she's out in some open field in Louisiana and she's got this hickety step because of broken leg and you're kind of chasing her. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=691.0s)]
*  She's trying to get away. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=699.0s)]
*  Originally, she'd keep away from me. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=700.0s)]
*  But once she got her toe, she rode on my bike one time, she got her toe caught in the spokes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=702.0s)]
*  And that was and that's what slowed her down. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=705.0s)]
*  And it caused permanent damage or? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=707.0s)]
*  It caused at least maybe two months of damage. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=709.0s)]
*  Wow. OK. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=711.0s)]
*  Well, my brother lost his front teeth two different ways in fifth grade. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=712.0s)]
*  I think first he did a wheelie on his stingray, front tire went boom, chip. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=718.0s)]
*  They got the caps. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=724.0s)]
*  Then he's doing Duncan yoyos and he's going loop the loop. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=725.0s)]
*  Bam. Chip them again. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=728.0s)]
*  Only twice. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=730.0s)]
*  I thought there'd be a third one, man. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=732.0s)]
*  It'll happen still. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=734.0s)]
*  Duncan Imperials. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=735.0s)]
*  I went shoplifted six of those at a Woolworths. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=736.0s)]
*  I would go to kids on the street, go, you want a yoyo? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=739.0s)]
*  And I go in, steal a yoyo, bring it out. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=742.0s)]
*  You want one? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=745.0s)]
*  Duncan Imperial. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=746.0s)]
*  Go in, take it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=747.0s)]
*  I was juvenile in fourth grade. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=748.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=751.0s)]
*  And what were you think you were acting out about some? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=752.0s)]
*  I'm sitting here with Dana Carvey as well. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=754.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry I didn't even introduce that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=756.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=758.0s)]
*  And what is that? Is Dana short for something? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=759.0s)]
*  Dana? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=761.0s)]
*  No, my name was Brett on the birth certificate. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=762.0s)]
*  My grandmother, because I had three older brothers, we were all stacked tight, five kids and 10 years, my mom. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=764.0s)]
*  And my grandmother said they're going to call him Brett the Brat. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=770.0s)]
*  So I think Dana Andrews was a movie star at the time. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=773.0s)]
*  I think it came from that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=777.0s)]
*  But it was I got in girls PE classes in high school. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=778.0s)]
*  Like the thing would come report to the girls physical education class. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=782.0s)]
*  Can you show up? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=785.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=786.0s)]
*  Theo is definitely a man's name. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=787.0s)]
*  But Dana is a switch hitter like Chris or Robin. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=789.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=792.0s)]
*  Robin was a wild one. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=793.0s)]
*  Dana. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=794.0s)]
*  But yeah, that must have been nice. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=795.0s)]
*  I was thinking, yeah, could it be short for something? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=796.0s)]
*  Maybe maybe bandana. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=798.0s)]
*  I could see. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=799.0s)]
*  They call me Dane the Brain because my two of my brothers were dyslexic. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=802.0s)]
*  So they got C's if they really tried. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=807.0s)]
*  So I got a few B's and then I was my nickname was Dane the Brain. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=809.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=812.0s)]
*  That's kind of funny. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=813.0s)]
*  If you're even smarter than your brother, you get classified as the brain, even if all y'all are dumb. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=814.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=818.0s)]
*  Not y'all. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=819.0s)]
*  But I'm just saying, no, no. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=820.0s)]
*  Any family, you know, like this is our smart kid. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=821.0s)]
*  You know, we get C's. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=823.0s)]
*  Well, it was it was it was bad for dyslexic kids in those days because they just put you in the the yellow book or the red reading book. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=824.0s)]
*  Then there was the green. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=832.0s)]
*  Pretty smart. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=833.0s)]
*  We got the blue book. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=834.0s)]
*  We were the rock stars and then they would send us to the speed reading kind of clockwork orange van and they would do the words like that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=835.0s)]
*  Read in a thousand words a minute. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=842.0s)]
*  So that was, you know, it was a weird childhood. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=843.0s)]
*  But I my brothers were we're all shoppers, shoplifters and smokers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=846.0s)]
*  We would steal my mom's Kent cigarettes and just wail on those. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=852.0s)]
*  And we would eat ice plants and no one would smell it on our breath. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=856.0s)]
*  And one day we went to the mall and we three of us, me, my two older brothers, we parked our bikes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=859.0s)]
*  Said, shit, someone's going to steal them. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=864.0s)]
*  We went into a hardware store, stole locks, locked up our bikes, went back in shoplifted, came home, laid everything out on a table. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=865.0s)]
*  My brother, Brad, who I based Garth on, a science brother, he added it all up and he goes, that's fourteen dollars and about ninety two cents of stuff in those days. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=874.0s)]
*  So that's so there we said 1492. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=884.0s)]
*  It's like Columbus. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=887.0s)]
*  So when you were shoplifting with your brother, you'd go, are you sailing the blue? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=889.0s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I'm sailing the blue. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=893.0s)]
*  I'm trying to get, you know, and my brother, Brad, eventually would steal for the sport of it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=895.0s)]
*  Like he'd go and get a whole LP album under his shirt and I go up, you see it sailing the blue and he goes, check it out. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=901.0s)]
*  I could I could take it if I want. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=908.0s)]
*  I could take it because he talked like that and then he would put it back. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=910.0s)]
*  So he was like a catch and release shoplifter. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=914.0s)]
*  Wow. You don't see a lot of that. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=917.0s)]
*  No, just for sport, just for. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=919.0s)]
*  But he was a brilliant kid. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=921.0s)]
*  I mean, we would go to Battle Creek, Michigan to get something from Kellogg's, you know, the cereal. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=923.0s)]
*  So you'd have to put a quarter in the envelope and he would just he tore a little part of the envelope open to see if they go, oh, poor kid. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=928.0s)]
*  If someone tore it and he would get the prize or if we wanted to buy candy at the mercantile, we went to the lake. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=937.0s)]
*  He would have a he would sort of take a piece of metal and make a slug out of it and put a quarter on top. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=944.0s)]
*  So the guy would think it was 50 cents. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=951.0s)]
*  He was clever kid. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=953.0s)]
*  He was real clever. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=955.0s)]
*  I sound like he's very I have that Ocean's Eleven in him, you know, like he's got that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=956.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=959.0s)]
*  And did he end up getting any any real crime? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=960.0s)]
*  No, he just he became he became a brilliant engineer. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=964.0s)]
*  He invented the first sort of sort of online. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=967.0s)]
*  They're sorry. Computer video home thing was called the video toaster with Tim Jensen in the 90s. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=971.0s)]
*  And he was a kid who had diesel batteries. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=977.0s)]
*  I found a frog one day and I gave it I thought it was dead. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=981.0s)]
*  You know, and he kind of hooked it up and it was sort of vibrating because he had these two decals and he sort of wired it up on it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=985.0s)]
*  And I thought it was kind of I was opening and I said, Bradley, I was opening. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=991.0s)]
*  And this is a true story. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=995.0s)]
*  I do my act, but he's like cars. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=996.0s)]
*  He said, yeah, I brought him back to life. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=997.0s)]
*  He'll never die again. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=999.0s)]
*  That was a but Scott and I. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1000.0s)]
*  So he was the one the bunk bed one. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1004.0s)]
*  And we were we all shared or you had a room with how many bunk beds in it? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1006.0s)]
*  The downstairs brothers that were weird even to this day, they had a bunk bed downstairs. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1010.0s)]
*  Mark, two brothers, two brothers and me and Scott up there, Mark and Brad and Mark would wet the bed like anybody's business. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1014.0s)]
*  So my parents got this machine in a catalog. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1021.0s)]
*  So it'd be like this plastic sheet and a little mechanical thing to wake him up when he'd start to wet the bed. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1025.0s)]
*  So he started to wet one night, but he went so much he killed the machine. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1031.0s)]
*  And that would rain down on Brad because he was the lower bunk. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1035.0s)]
*  But he was inventing all kinds of stuff. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1038.0s)]
*  But and then Scott and I, we were upstairs and he would sleep with the covers over. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1040.0s)]
*  But we was a rough and tumble second day baked goods. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1045.0s)]
*  You know, you go to my mom and go to the bakery one day old, too, too expensive. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1049.0s)]
*  Two day old. They're almost giving it away. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1054.0s)]
*  Yeah. So we put those in a freezer. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1056.0s)]
*  My dad would buy a side of cheap, cheap beef and he would put it in this freezer and then we'd get it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1058.0s)]
*  And it was almost all gristle. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1065.0s)]
*  It goes, oh, Jesus Christ, the best parts of gristle. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1067.0s)]
*  And it was just like gnarly steak. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1070.0s)]
*  So I had a blocked artery by the time I was your age. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1073.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent blocked, man. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1076.0s)]
*  It was really blocked. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1079.0s)]
*  There was so much fight. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1080.0s)]
*  I think like there was so much more mystery and stuff. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1082.0s)]
*  It seems like when you look at like your childhood, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1086.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then you have children now. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1090.0s)]
*  How many children do you have? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1091.0s)]
*  Two. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1093.0s)]
*  OK. And you have two male children that I know of, sir. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1094.0s)]
*  Right. And so y'all are male heavy. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1097.0s)]
*  Y'all seed line is male heavy. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1098.0s)]
*  Yeah, basically. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1100.0s)]
*  My younger sister, my mom had four boys. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1102.0s)]
*  I've had two boys. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1105.0s)]
*  So a lot of, you know, I think masculinity begats masculinity. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1106.0s)]
*  No, I'm just saying it's almost like a damn gay nightclub at this point. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1110.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm saying there's a lot of men in it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1114.0s)]
*  That's all I'm saying, dude. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1116.0s)]
*  But why is it a gay nightclub? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1117.0s)]
*  You're going to have a lot of men over there, you know? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1119.0s)]
*  I'm just saying Jeffrey Dahmer would buy all a couple of sandwiches. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1122.0s)]
*  Well, there was a lot of wrestling. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1126.0s)]
*  So my dad, first of all, he loved to grow a scratchy beard. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1127.0s)]
*  And then he'd go, oh, Jesus Christ, time for the whiskers. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1132.0s)]
*  You're like five years old. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1135.0s)]
*  You weigh like 40 pounds. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1136.0s)]
*  Ah, and he would get on top of you and he'd go, whiskers. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1137.0s)]
*  And he would just rub his face on your face like, ah, ah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1140.0s)]
*  And then he'd have me, oh, Jesus Christ, fight him. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1144.0s)]
*  So I had to fight my brother Scott, who seemed like a giant compared to me. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1147.0s)]
*  He was 12. I was 10. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1150.0s)]
*  And he'd go, oh, grab his balls. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1151.0s)]
*  He would scream at us. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1153.0s)]
*  Your dad would? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1154.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, grab his balls. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1155.0s)]
*  So that was these are these are good times, Theo. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1157.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1161.0s)]
*  I had a Disney face when I was your age. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1162.0s)]
*  So people always used to think, what a what a mellow, easy, happy life you've had. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1166.0s)]
*  But it was it was good that we had each other. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1171.0s)]
*  Right. And so it sounds like it sounds like y'all were really close, huh? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1173.0s)]
*  We are. We are still now. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1176.0s)]
*  We survived it. It was a fascinating time. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1178.0s)]
*  It was, you know, but you look back on your childhood pretty fondly. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1181.0s)]
*  It sounds like you look back on because you have so many like memories. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1185.0s)]
*  I love I'm like kind of fascinated by nostalgia and stuff. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1188.0s)]
*  So I think I think about those times a lot, you know? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1191.0s)]
*  Well, I think that those years you can't ever get back. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1194.0s)]
*  And those years are precious. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1197.0s)]
*  The thing that we were able to do is we were so independent. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1199.0s)]
*  There was one landline. It was a party line. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1203.0s)]
*  Sometimes you pick it up and the neighbors are using it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1205.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Yeah. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1207.0s)]
*  So you were just gone a lot. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1209.0s)]
*  And my dad would go to Montana with his friends a lot. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1211.0s)]
*  And so we were be just on our own and just get on your Schwinn Stingray. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1215.0s)]
*  My brother got the Schwinn Monster Green. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1220.0s)]
*  My parents ran out of money. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1222.0s)]
*  They got me this Sears offloader, whatever it was. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1223.0s)]
*  It was a cheap kickoff. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1226.0s)]
*  Which I knew it was OK, but the step kid or whatever the bike was even called. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1228.0s)]
*  I think so. The other Scott was the favorite. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1231.0s)]
*  So we we just ride around all day and we just you know, I played flag football in fifth grade. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1235.0s)]
*  And it seemed like professional sports. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1242.0s)]
*  I loved it. Ready, break. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1245.0s)]
*  And I was the halfback. And you know, so I agree with you. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1248.0s)]
*  That's why I call them the Seminole years. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1251.0s)]
*  I think they're so important to about 12. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1253.0s)]
*  And that then then life kind of interrupts. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1256.0s)]
*  But before that, you're taking in so much information. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1258.0s)]
*  You know, what about you? Yeah, I mean, you had a decent time. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1262.0s)]

*  Are you scared? Dude, I was very scared growing up. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1268.0s)]
*  I think I think I just grew up like real sensitive, like super sensitive, real scared. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1271.0s)]
*  What was it like? I think, yeah, it's a lot of time alone. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1276.0s)]
*  A lot of time strange babysitters, you know, we had a babysitter that got a roach in her ear one night. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1282.0s)]
*  And she kept like yelling at us that she had a roach in her ear, but she spoke also Spanish or something. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1288.0s)]
*  I don't know if she spoke Spanish or just something was like wrong with her or something. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1293.0s)]
*  Or she didn't maybe she didn't speak real well or something, but we thought it was Spanish, you know. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yeah, babysitters are memorable. We had one when I was five. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1300.0s)]
*  My parents drove to Montana and you lived in Montana growing up. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1304.0s)]
*  No, just till age five. But we went there every summer. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1308.0s)]
*  I was just there. So I'm a native son in a sense. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1311.0s)]
*  But that babysitter like I'm five and I got she's putting Bactine and a bandaid on my knee and I'm five. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1314.0s)]
*  And I'm remembering her years later like she was a fairy princess, like gorgeous. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1321.0s)]
*  So I said, brothers, at the time, Mark was like 12. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1327.0s)]
*  And he goes, oh, yes, she was just a complete knockout. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1330.0s)]
*  But that's that was a memory when I was five. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1334.0s)]
*  I wasn't thinking sexually. I just thought it just hit my brain. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1337.0s)]

*  I don't know what she was. There was something unique about her to us, you know? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1463.0s)]
*  Yeah. And she, she got a roach in her ear and she was trying to tell us and we're just kids. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1466.0s)]
*  You know, I remember and she's like yelling in Spanish about having like a curcaracha and I don't know what they call it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1473.0s)]
*  She's yelling at the kids. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1481.0s)]
*  We don't know. We don't know what's going on. We, you know, we don't know if it's like charades armor. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1483.0s)]

*  God, it's funny because that's such a great word for that accent because I remember Al Pacino doing a Cuban accent. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1494.0s)]
*  A curcaracha is a great word. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1500.0s)]
*  Curcaracha. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1503.0s)]
*  Curcaracha. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1504.0s)]
*  Entaire. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1505.0s)]
*  Entaire. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1506.0s)]
*  Entaire. Curcaracha. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1507.0s)]
*  Sorry, am I canceled? Can't do that accent. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1508.0s)]
*  No, you're good, dude. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1510.0s)]
*  Curcaracha. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1511.0s)]
*  So yeah, so I just for a second because. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1512.0s)]
*  My father was Nicaraguan also. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1514.0s)]
*  So you're good to do that here. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1516.0s)]
*  So he had a full accent and everything? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1518.0s)]
*  He had probably, I would say, 40% accent. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1520.0s)]
*  So you would say, I don't know the difference. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1523.0s)]
*  I just know a general, I just know Al Pacino's crazy Cuban accent. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1526.0s)]
*  So Theo, why are you going to talk Theo? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1530.0s)]
*  It's time for Thanksgiving dinner Theo. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1533.0s)]
*  Is that how he said it? No, he didn't. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1535.0s)]
*  Not that much. He's a little lighter, you know? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1537.0s)]
*  Hey Theo. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1539.0s)]
*  Hey Theo. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1540.0s)]
*  So what did he think of you? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1541.0s)]
*  He was jealous of you, you think? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1543.0s)]
*  Like my dad had it in for me a little bit. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1545.0s)]
*  Was he jealous of you, you think? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1547.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1549.0s)]
*  He was jealous that you were kind of like funny and fun? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1550.0s)]
*  He didn't think I was funny. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1553.0s)]
*  I think my brother Brad could fix things like, you know, our tool drawer was really sucked. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1555.0s)]
*  Like the hammer always was lost. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1560.0s)]
*  So Brad would take a butter knife and fix the dryer. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1562.0s)]
*  And my dad would stand over him and then try to take credit for it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1565.0s)]
*  He was just insecure about not being able to do that. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1569.0s)]
*  The funny thing is because my mom called me precious. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1572.0s)]
*  I look kind of androgynous. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1574.0s)]
*  I don't know what he thought I was. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1576.0s)]
*  Yeah, I could see it a little. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1578.0s)]
*  And he was, oh I definitely had a very much a baby face. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1580.0s)]
*  And he had it in for him. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1582.0s)]
*  But what did your dad think of you? Were you the favorite son? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1584.0s)]
*  How many brothers? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1586.0s)]
*  I had one brother and two sisters. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1588.0s)]
*  And my dad was born in 1910, so he was an old man, right? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1590.0s)]
*  So by the time you were like eight or ten, he was almost 80 then. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1593.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was almost 80. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1597.0s)]
*  When I was 10, he was 80. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1599.0s)]
*  He was interesting. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1601.0s)]
*  I don't think I knew what he thought of me. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1602.0s)]
*  He would be sleeping a lot. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1604.0s)]
*  Like a lot of my memories are my mom waking him up and him being kind of pissed off about stuff. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1606.0s)]
*  Or he'd be sitting somewhere and he would just kind of doze off. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1610.0s)]
*  He liked to let me sometimes rub on his shoulders a little bit. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1614.0s)]
*  Sometimes he would smell like beer. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1619.0s)]
*  He let me drive his car whenever I was tall enough to drive. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1623.0s)]
*  He needed help a little bit. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1628.0s)]
*  So it was kind of like this trade-off a little. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1632.0s)]
*  But what did he think? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1634.0s)]
*  He's got three other kids. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1636.0s)]
*  Between him and your mom, was there anyone who was the clear-cut favorite? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1638.0s)]
*  I was my mom's favorite and Scott was my dad's favorite. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1644.0s)]
*  Because all of a sudden you'd come home as a new guitar. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1648.0s)]
*  It's not even Christmas or his birthday. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1650.0s)]
*  Fuck! That must have been way unfair. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1652.0s)]
*  Oh man! But I was not envious of it to be Bud's favorite. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1654.0s)]
*  No, Scott didn't. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1658.0s)]
*  That was great. Get away from the monster. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1660.0s)]
*  But I thought, he's just getting toys. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1662.0s)]
*  He was called Scotchman or Scott the Pot. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1664.0s)]
*  Oh, he got it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1666.0s)]
*  Did you have a nickname, Theo de Leo? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1668.0s)]
*  No, I think I just had Theo, what is it? Teddy maybe sometimes? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1670.0s)]
*  Why did they name you Theo? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1674.0s)]
*  It's such a unique name, isn't it? For your generation? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1676.0s)]
*  Yeah, my dad's name was Teodoro. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1678.0s)]
*  So we had some type of Spanish flair or something. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1682.0s)]
*  Teodoro. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1686.0s)]
*  Teodoro Roosevelt. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1688.0s)]
*  I named my son, so he'd become a Presidente. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1690.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, is it offensive? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1694.0s)]
*  Teodoro Roosevelt. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1696.0s)]
*  I think it's good. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1698.0s)]
*  I used to think you must have been such a cool kid because you have such a curious brain. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1700.0s)]
*  So I hope that you're... What about your mom? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1704.0s)]
*  My mom was busy working so we had these strange people that'd be over there. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1706.0s)]
*  A lot of these babysitters and we'd make up stories and tell them stuff. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1710.0s)]
*  A lot of them, we'd have like this big black lady that would take care of us [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1714.0s)]
*  or a very old woman that would take care of us. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1720.0s)]
*  And just like we had this Spanish lady with the roach in her. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1722.0s)]
*  So there was just like, I think we didn't really know who was going to be there. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1726.0s)]
*  One time we did get the hot chick, dude. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1730.0s)]
*  I remember she took me to summer camp or day camp at the YMCA. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1732.0s)]
*  And she drove this orange car. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1736.0s)]
*  And she drove this orange car, I don't remember. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1738.0s)]
*  And she played Bon Jovi and I just remember... [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1740.0s)]
*  I don't think I'd ever heard music until there was like a hot woman present. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1743.0s)]
*  And suddenly I could hear music, I was cool. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1747.0s)]
*  And I was like, play it again, play it again. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1750.0s)]
*  And just like her interacting with me or engaging with me was like the most magical thing I remember. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1753.0s)]
*  And then, yeah, she was not even cute, I don't think. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1759.0s)]
*  But I thought she was just the hottest thing ever. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1763.0s)]
*  She looked like a man, actually. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1766.0s)]
*  She was almost like a man. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1769.0s)]
*  She had like a short haircut and she... [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1771.0s)]
*  I think a lot of dudes would have been like, whoa, you know. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1773.0s)]
*  She's not my first choice of a woman, you know. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1777.0s)]
*  I had crushes, I had just mad crushes with absolute shyness. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1780.0s)]
*  Linda Benson, there was like a... [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1786.0s)]
*  She had some tits, huh? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1789.0s)]
*  Seventh grade party and you do a makeout session in the dark. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1790.0s)]
*  And it was Linda Benson and she knew her way around that situation. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1794.0s)]
*  What did they do? They put you all in a closet or something? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1799.0s)]
*  It was just a dark room and I, you know, seventh grade and I'm like, what? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1801.0s)]
*  And suddenly, yeah, maybe we went in a closet. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1805.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1807.0s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1809.0s)]
*  Is it like... [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1811.0s)]
*  The hardest part ever was I think trying to touch a breast or something. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1812.0s)]
*  And at the movies, a lot of guys, there'd be big guys, like touch it, get that titty, boy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1815.0s)]
*  And they threaten you if you didn't do it, you know. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1820.0s)]
*  So then you're like working off of a clock, kind of like a shot clock. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1822.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is that there were... I don't know where you were. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1826.0s)]
*  In junior high, there's some women that go, right. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1829.0s)]
*  They come back from the summertime and they've been genetically gifted. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1832.0s)]
*  They're suddenly stunning. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1836.0s)]
*  Some of the guys, we had a guy who's like had a little beard. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1837.0s)]
*  He was all muscley. He was in eighth grade. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1841.0s)]
*  And I look like a fetus with shoes. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1844.0s)]
*  I mean, I was nothing was happening. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1846.0s)]
*  But I got a chip on my shoulder. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1848.0s)]
*  Did you? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1852.0s)]
*  I don't know where my drive comes from a little bit, but I hate to lose. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1853.0s)]
*  And I hate anyone trying to fuck with me. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1857.0s)]
*  But I mostly want to be nice and friendly and stuff. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1860.0s)]
*  But if someone goes, I'm not good with that, I attack pretty hard. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1863.0s)]
*  Not physically, but I will. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1867.0s)]
*  Verbal, you'll get there. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1869.0s)]
*  I have to get the upper hand. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1871.0s)]
*  But Spade's got an edge to him too. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1872.0s)]
*  My good buddy Spade. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1876.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had a nice time. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1878.0s)]
*  We had dinner the other night. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1879.0s)]
*  That was fun. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1880.0s)]
*  We ended up laughing our ass off about your comedy team. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1881.0s)]
*  Australian dancers in Vegas. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1884.0s)]
*  Your movie idea that they try to go to Vegas and they come like thunder down under. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1888.0s)]
*  Like models with their shirts off. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1892.0s)]
*  They call themselves Kalki and Baus. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1894.0s)]
*  On Kalki's bow. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1896.0s)]
*  Together we're Kalki and Baus. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1898.0s)]
*  And then you have little... [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1900.0s)]
*  It only lasts like one... [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1902.0s)]
*  It's only 30 seconds of the movie. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1903.0s)]
*  But that was just funny. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1905.0s)]
*  But yeah, Spade's... [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1907.0s)]
*  I think we... [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1908.0s)]
*  It's like... [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1909.0s)]
*  He's fun. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1910.0s)]
*  You guys have your podcast, right? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1911.0s)]
*  It's called Flying the Wall. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1912.0s)]
*  Flying the Wall. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1914.0s)]
*  It's called Flying the Wall. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1915.0s)]
*  This is a promotion. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1916.0s)]
*  Yeah, David, knowing him since before SNL. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1918.0s)]
*  Met him when he came in. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1920.0s)]
*  He was always cool. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1921.0s)]
*  You met him before that? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1922.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1923.0s)]
*  He was like 21. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1924.0s)]
*  I was like 30 or something. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1925.0s)]
*  And did he seem similar to you kind of? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1927.0s)]
*  There was a period of time where... [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was definitely from my tribe. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1932.0s)]
*  You know, we have a... [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1935.0s)]
*  There was a time when he opened for me. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1937.0s)]
*  So he's like 28, 29. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1940.0s)]
*  I'm like 38. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1942.0s)]
*  And he'd come out. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1943.0s)]
*  We were playing these sheds in the round in the Northeast. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1945.0s)]
*  And he'd walk out and they'd go, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1949.0s)]
*  whoo, from a wide shot. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1950.0s)]
*  At that point they thought it was me. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1952.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1954.0s)]
*  And so... [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1955.0s)]
*  And they're like, boo. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1956.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1958.0s)]
*  This babe was so hip even then. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1959.0s)]
*  Eventually he just had shorts on and a skateboard. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1960.0s)]
*  And he would kind of just hang over the stool. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1962.0s)]
*  And he's like, what's up, everybody? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1964.0s)]
*  And I go, you can do it that way? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1966.0s)]
*  I didn't even know you could do it that way. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1968.0s)]
*  And he was hysterical. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1970.0s)]
*  Because I come out jumping around, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1971.0s)]
*  isn't that special? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1972.0s)]
*  Hums and flasasasas. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1973.0s)]
*  You know, I drench in sweat. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1974.0s)]
*  And this babe is just cool. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1976.0s)]
*  He's got a little diet Pepsi. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1977.0s)]
*  What's up, ladies? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1978.0s)]

*  So he's the coolest. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1980.0s)]
*  But really fun to do a podcast with him. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1981.0s)]
*  He can drop a little sketch in five seconds. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1983.0s)]
*  He can take a story of just that the hamburger was overcooked. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1988.0s)]
*  And the guy's going, I'm like, whoop. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1992.0s)]
*  And I go, rrrr. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1994.0s)]
*  And he goes, hey, buddy, could you shh a little bit on that? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1995.0s)]
*  Boo. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1997.0s)]
*  I mean, he'll create a complete sketch in five seconds. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=1998.0s)]

*  It's so lo-fi. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2002.0s)]
*  He doesn't push it at all. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2004.0s)]
*  And you've got to go back and rewind it almost. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2005.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2008.0s)]
*  That's a remarkable way to say him. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2009.0s)]
*  It's like he's not out there barking about his wares. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2010.0s)]
*  It's just like, hey, come see what I made here. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2014.0s)]
*  He's got this little physical moves that represent another person, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2016.0s)]
*  a little effect, and really funny word packages. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2020.0s)]
*  Hey, buddy. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2023.0s)]

*  Pth, pth, pth, pth. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2028.0s)]
*  I learned that from John the Winner. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2030.0s)]
*  You know, then the rotary dial went out and I lost my closer. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2032.0s)]
*  Fuck! [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2035.0s)]
*  Oh, that's the worst. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2036.0s)]
*  That's the worst when time starts to change. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2037.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2041.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird about humor? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2042.0s)]
*  Do you find this, Dana, that I get scared that I don't know what the next [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2043.0s)]
*  generation of humor is? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2047.0s)]
*  Because it's almost impossible to really know it because you have to live, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2049.0s)]
*  you have to come up in it, really. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2054.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2056.0s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2057.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously I don't generally now go east. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2058.0s)]
*  I don't do Indian accents or Japanese accents. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2062.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2066.0s)]
*  I can do them. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2067.0s)]
*  And I had a bit about them and I just sort of dropped it. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2069.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2072.0s)]
*  There's this sensitivity now. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2073.0s)]
*  But I do agree with Bill Burr. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2075.0s)]
*  He was on our podcast, Fly on the Wall, that if the intent is to hurt is [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2077.0s)]
*  different than just an observation. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2081.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2083.0s)]
*  You know, I just was talking about where maybe the dialect of a Japanese [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2084.0s)]
*  accent came from. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2088.0s)]
*  Just that every accent like French is, de bezie, la gosse, where did that come [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2089.0s)]
*  from? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2093.0s)]
*  And where did, you know, wudu, zudu, de sa, wudu, like that. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2094.0s)]
*  And I figured it's because of all the ring of fire, all the earthquakes. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2099.0s)]
*  So you're just sitting around, wudu. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2103.0s)]
*  Wudu, zudu, wudu, wudu, you know, so that was that. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2105.0s)]
*  So I don't know if you don't have to edit that out, but I just have this one. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2109.0s)]
*  Wudu, zudu, wudu, wudu, I mean, so because why do they talk like that? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2112.0s)]
*  They could have talked like this. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2116.0s)]
*  Everybody could have talked like this. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2118.0s)]
*  All humans, all humanoids were just grunting all over the world, pointing [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2120.0s)]
*  and brunting. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2124.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2125.0s)]
*  And then the sounds came up. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2126.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2128.0s)]
*  You know, and I think the Indian was more copacetic on the trade routes. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2130.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2135.0s)]
*  Wudu, or, don't get, put it all, do the boop, do the da da da. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2136.0s)]
*  You know, it's lyrical and very copacetic. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2142.0s)]
*  Like, I will not hurt you, but you will not hurt me. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2144.0s)]
*  So I don't know if you have to cut this part out. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2147.0s)]
*  No, I think it's interesting, man, because we used to play this game when I remember [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2150.0s)]
*  the first time we met a Japanese guy, we played this game where it was like, we would [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2153.0s)]
*  make some sounds and see if it was something in Japanese, you know? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2156.0s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2159.0s)]
*  We'd be like, and then we would ask him, you know, what the hell? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2166.0s)]
*  No, but it's incredible accent to listen to. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2167.0s)]
*  It's crazy to think that somebody has a whole different, like, like Bible of what is [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2171.0s)]
*  sounds and thoughts inside. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2177.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2179.0s)]
*  And I'm just into rhythms. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2180.0s)]
*  That's all, you know, they, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2181.0s)]
*  And when I hear, I just like, it's just poetry to me, you know, with any accent. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2185.0s)]
*  Well, it makes me think too, what their thoughts and insides are like, you know, and what some [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2194.0s)]
*  of the mechanics are like inside of it, you know, that's what I wonder sometimes. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2198.0s)]
*  And where does it come from emotionally for the male and the female dynamic? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2202.0s)]
*  Yeah, cause jet, like, like a lot of Asian females are very, yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2207.0s)]
*  And the men are kind of alpha male, which you can sort of practice probably lowering [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2214.0s)]
*  your voice. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2221.0s)]
*  It's coming from, you know, like a sea. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2222.0s)]
*  It's almost where semen launches from, like right there. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2224.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2227.0s)]
*  That could be a guy ordering a Pepsi. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2235.0s)]
*  This is my favorite podcast ever. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2238.0s)]
*  I'm just saying this. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2240.0s)]
*  I think there's a guy ordering a Pepsi. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2241.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2243.0s)]
*  Or a guy having a male orgasm. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2246.0s)]
*  And they don't have a lot of orgasms also in Japan and in, we're orgasm heavy over here. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2247.0s)]
*  I mean, we're skeeting up the landscape, you know, and then we're orgasm heavy. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2253.0s)]
*  We're skeeting up the landscape. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2257.0s)]
*  So in your mind, we climax more than Japanese people or Asian people or any other culture, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2259.0s)]
*  by far, because we are the world literally. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2266.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2268.0s)]
*  We are the world. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2269.0s)]
*  We are the world. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2270.0s)]
*  You know, we're- [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2271.0s)]
*  Were you in that video? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2272.0s)]
*  No, but I could do a Springsteen if you want. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2273.0s)]
*  We are the world. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2276.0s)]
*  I'm Bruce Springsteen. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2277.0s)]
*  I'm five foot seven and a good day. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2278.0s)]
*  But with my boots and my cowboy hat, it's six feet of Springsteen coming at you. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2280.0s)]
*  Sure, I could have fixed my underbite, but why? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2284.0s)]
*  I'm worth a billion dollars and I love everybody. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2287.0s)]
*  So anyway, that's- what were we saying? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2290.0s)]
*  We are the- [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2293.0s)]
*  Remember the Michael Jackson video? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2294.0s)]
*  I just mean all the badass people of the world came to America. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2295.0s)]
*  All the aggressive people are- that's why we are so freedom heavy here. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2299.0s)]
*  If they told the anti-vaxxers, we're not going to admonish you. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2304.0s)]
*  We're not going to say you're a piece of shit and you're a murderer, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2308.0s)]
*  but could you please get a vaccine? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2310.0s)]
*  They would have been like, sure, man. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2312.0s)]
*  You just ask me. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2314.0s)]
*  But if you go, you got to get one. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2315.0s)]
*  Fuck you, man. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2316.0s)]
*  American. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2317.0s)]
*  No one tells me what to do. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2318.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2319.0s)]
*  It was just the wrong strategy. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2320.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2321.0s)]
*  You know, Arnold did a PSA. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2322.0s)]
*  It should have been instead of, you know, fuck your freedom, it should have been, you [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2323.0s)]
*  know, if you could look at it, you know, you could maybe go to the doctor. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2325.0s)]
*  You get the little injection, you know, and you help all the people instead of you murder [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2329.0s)]
*  us. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2334.0s)]
*  But we are badasses. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2335.0s)]
*  We're the people. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2336.0s)]
*  You know, my ancestors, just somebody at some point in Ireland just said, I think I'm leaving. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2342.0s)]
*  I don't know, I'm out there. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2343.0s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2344.0s)]
*  I don't want to stay here in the rain in the potatoes. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2345.0s)]
*  I'm going to America. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2346.0s)]
*  You could get killed. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2347.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2348.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2349.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2350.0s)]
*  We'll have a better menu. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2351.0s)]
*  So where- you have Nicaraguan. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2352.0s)]
*  Polish and Nicaraguan, yes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2353.0s)]
*  So somebody probably fucked on a boat, I'm guessing, because I don't know how you even [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2354.0s)]
*  get that mix, you know, but- [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2357.0s)]
*  That's a steamroller that went through the Suez Canal and somehow connected your mom [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2359.0s)]
*  and dad. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2364.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2365.0s)]
*  It was probably a hundred ton steamroller. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2366.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2369.0s)]
*  But I think, look, man, I want to go back to this guy. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2370.0s)]
*  I think we're semen heavy over here, right? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2372.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2374.0s)]
*  So you mean we have a lot of semen or we climax a lot? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2375.0s)]
*  We climax a lot here, I believe, in America, because we're all- we're selling it now. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2377.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of- and I know there's Japanese porn and stuff, but in Japan, like, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2381.0s)]
*  even if you go there, it's hard to meet women. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2385.0s)]
*  There's not as much, I don't think, promiscuous sex, from what I've heard anyway. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2387.0s)]
*  Well, look, I don't know. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2392.0s)]
*  Like, for me as a kid, you'd go to the dump or go in a park. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2394.0s)]
*  And jerk off? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2399.0s)]
*  No, you'd find a beat up Playboy magazine. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2400.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2403.0s)]
*  And I don't understand. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2404.0s)]
*  I can't wrap my mind around a 12-year-old online going on porn. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2405.0s)]
*  I don't know what toxicity or joy that represents, but the boys are falling behind the educational system. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2411.0s)]
*  So technology gave boys video games, you know, and porn, and then said, now, study your algebra. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2419.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2426.0s)]
*  I think I got something better to do. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2427.0s)]
*  I'm about to find the square of my own route. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2431.0s)]
*  At least he had a smart answer. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2435.0s)]
*  Totally, Dad, I'm going to do it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2437.0s)]
*  So it's the boys are behind now. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2439.0s)]
*  This is the- it's been the year of the woman for the last 30 years, which I'm okay with, but here we are again in 2023. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2442.0s)]
*  It is drum roll year of the woman again. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2449.0s)]
*  And so it's a great time to be a woman and I'm all for it. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2453.0s)]
*  It's just the boys have been the porn and the video games are- [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2456.0s)]
*  We've been really beat down. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2459.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you ever tail end that? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2461.0s)]
*  Were you into Nintendo? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2463.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got Nintendo came out. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2465.0s)]
*  I remember when we get a game on our birthday, usually you'd get a game and your friend would come over to see what game it was. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2467.0s)]
*  You had that one gift and you'd open it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2472.0s)]
*  And when porn came along, man, I remember, yeah, I would bike far for porn if I heard there was porn somewhere. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2474.0s)]
*  You know, I was starved. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2481.0s)]
*  I was starved for like, for motherly affection. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2483.0s)]
*  So I think when porn came around, it really started to fulfill some of that space in my life. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2486.0s)]
*  Let me just unpack that for a minute because I was a therapist for a brief period of time. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2491.0s)]
*  Were you really? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2496.0s)]
*  I'm not. No, but I love talking about human aid. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2497.0s)]
*  So what do you mean you were starved for affection? Your mom didn't give you affection? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2500.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think my mom didn't like look at me much. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2504.0s)]
*  You know, she didn't- [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2507.0s)]
*  Did she hug you? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2509.0s)]
*  She didn't pick me up much. No. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2510.0s)]
*  I had a sister that was real sick that had, she was born with like a rare liver condition. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2512.0s)]
*  And so she is different than the rest of my siblings because she got actually like physically picked up. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2516.0s)]
*  But my mom didn't, she doesn't know that there's like this emotional world at all. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2522.0s)]
*  I think she just probably didn't get it, you know. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2526.0s)]
*  I don't know if I got a lot of it either. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2528.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe it was the 60s. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2531.0s)]
*  You know, I don't remember, you know, I love you. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2533.0s)]
*  But she was nice. She was sweet. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2537.0s)]
*  But she was the sixth kid. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2539.0s)]
*  She was as terrified of my dad as we all were, you know. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2541.0s)]
*  Oh, your mom was? Oh, wow. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2545.0s)]
*  Yeah, but she wasn't mean. She was sweet. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2547.0s)]
*  But she was terrified. We all were. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2549.0s)]
*  It was just like, you know, this one time I got up. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2551.0s)]
*  These are just fun stories. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2554.0s)]
*  I got up and, you know, I was like four or five and there was no toilet paper. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2556.0s)]
*  And I had to, you know, and so I used the towel and I was so young. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2561.0s)]
*  I just put it back on the rack. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2564.0s)]
*  So to wipe my butt. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2567.0s)]
*  And my dad came out with it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2568.0s)]
*  And then I had to grab my ankles in front of everybody. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2570.0s)]
*  And he had asked my brothers how many. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2572.0s)]
*  You had to go get his belt and he'd snap it. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2576.0s)]
*  You had to go grab it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2579.0s)]
*  You had to go get it. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2581.0s)]
*  You get the belt and then he would snap it and you'd grab your ankles. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2582.0s)]
*  And then he'd ask your brothers, how many? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2586.0s)]
*  So then your brothers get to chime in. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2588.0s)]
*  Give him four. Four. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2590.0s)]
*  And then he would just start screaming. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2592.0s)]
*  So the next day I had short term memory issues. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2595.0s)]
*  I wiped my ass again with a towel in his bathroom and I put it back on the rack. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2599.0s)]
*  No, I didn't do it a second time. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2603.0s)]
*  I didn't do it a second time. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2605.0s)]
*  But I wanted to tell you about my toys because we didn't have, I came up during so-called practical effects. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2607.0s)]
*  Like we got Rock'em Sock'em Robots. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2614.0s)]
*  There was nothing visual on a TV screen. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2616.0s)]
*  Rock'em Sock'em Robots was amazing. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2619.0s)]
*  Getaway chase game. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2621.0s)]
*  And we played a lot of board games. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2624.0s)]
*  You know, they're kind of cool. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2625.0s)]
*  Don't you find the tactile three dimensional board, Stratego or Risk? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2626.0s)]
*  Risk is fun. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2632.0s)]
*  You're playing Risk. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2633.0s)]
*  Candy Land we played. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2634.0s)]
*  We played a lot of games. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2635.0s)]
*  Scrabble we played a lot. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2636.0s)]
*  I remember my favorite time actually as a kid was when the power would go out because our family had to all get together. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2638.0s)]
*  It was like we had to be kind of stuck in the same room because we needed like, you know, mom had two candles or whatever. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2644.0s)]
*  And so we'd have to go downstairs. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2650.0s)]
*  And you couldn't really fight because if you fought and ran off out of the distance of the candle light, it was real scary. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2652.0s)]
*  So yeah, power outages were hip. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2657.0s)]
*  Everybody had to like, you kind of needed each other, you know. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2659.0s)]
*  So it was like there was I used to kind of like hope that the power would go out because it would give me a time where I don't know. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2662.0s)]
*  I just really like those moments where we all it was like the only time I felt like our family. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2669.0s)]
*  There was a semblance of that. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2675.0s)]
*  We needed each other, you know. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2676.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2677.0s)]
*  I do know that the visceral feeling of like you kind of say you're not feeling well, can't go to school. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2679.0s)]
*  And then you had the house to yourself all day because my mom taught preschool and you're watching anybody can teach preschool. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2686.0s)]
*  No offense to your mom. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2693.0s)]
*  I'm sure she was awesome. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2694.0s)]
*  No, she was. Yeah, my sister became a preschool teacher. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2695.0s)]
*  But being in the house by yourself and then looking out the window at like three o'clock and seeing the kids who went to school is a little melancholy. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2697.0s)]
*  I was almost like a panic attack. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2704.0s)]
*  Like I should have gone. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2705.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2706.0s)]
*  And it's like when school was canceled, you find out that there's no school today because of whatever reason. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2707.0s)]
*  All those feelings. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2713.0s)]
*  Same thing with the powers out, you know, and, you know, the all these things again, they inform us. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2714.0s)]
*  That's what my five years of therapy was about. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2720.0s)]
*  All those experiences and how they stay with you, you know, and how it manifests in you now. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2723.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting how it does. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2729.0s)]
*  So did your did you and your dad have a good relationship? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2731.0s)]
*  Because it sounds like I think a lot of men from his era probably just had a tougher. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2735.0s)]
*  I think it was a different thing of being a man back then. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2739.0s)]
*  It was full John Wayne shit. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2742.0s)]
*  And he was so terrified of his son not being, you know, and he was an orphan and he went through different, you know, and then he got in the Navy in 1943 or something or the Army. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2744.0s)]
*  And he's an orphan with a gun. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2754.0s)]
*  Now he's while he was a radio operator in India, but I'm sure he had a firearm at some point, but it was it was a different time. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2757.0s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes I would pick up the phone at night. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2765.0s)]
*  I'd hear his birth mother saying, you forgive me, buddy, because he was nicknamed as Bud, for giving him up at birth. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2767.0s)]
*  Oh, so he had his he was wounded and had that deep seated insecurity. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2774.0s)]
*  I think he had a little colorblind and a little dyslexic stuff that would have not been diagnosed. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2780.0s)]
*  So he had an inferiority complex. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2786.0s)]
*  But I, you know, in the end of the day, I don't harbor any. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2788.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm kind of like, you know, just moving on. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2791.0s)]
*  I mean, but but there were times there was a few times I felt like he was being intentionally cruel to me and getting off on it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2794.0s)]
*  You know, because when all my brothers left, I was the last one to focus on. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2802.0s)]
*  And I'm with my two high school buddies, cross country runners, really close friends. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2807.0s)]
*  All we did was run. And I was going to work this weed killer and sprayed around the yard. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2812.0s)]
*  So he came in the garage ago. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2817.0s)]
*  How do I get the top of this off, Dad? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2819.0s)]
*  And he goes, this is the quote. My friends never forgot. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2821.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, use your penis, you shit head. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2824.0s)]
*  So we broke that. Use your penis, you shit head. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2829.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, OK, it's practical advice. I'm a shit head. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2832.0s)]
*  I don't know how to do it. Can I use my penis? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2835.0s)]
*  So I started. No, but that. But then he kind of it was real anger. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2838.0s)]
*  And my friends left it. It freaked them out. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2841.0s)]
*  And six weeks later, I got out of there. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2843.0s)]
*  I thought this is not good. Use your penis, you shit head. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2845.0s)]
*  It's a poetry to it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2848.0s)]
*  You know, we all laughed a lot now. I mean, we we laughed even then. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2850.0s)]
*  We just have fits of laughter. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2853.0s)]
*  Dude, laughter was so there used to be a value to the moment, you know, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2855.0s)]
*  and I think about this a lot that there used to be like the moment was so valuable [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2859.0s)]
*  because you couldn't there wasn't a lot of recording of it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2864.0s)]
*  There wasn't nobody had the opportunity to see it again. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2867.0s)]
*  A million times over, it was like, this is the frickin moment. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2869.0s)]
*  Are you going to be here right now? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2873.0s)]
*  Go. And you know what I've observed is like young women are the happiest people on Earth. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2876.0s)]
*  Really? Because I go to Griffith Park and I got my sweatshirt hood on. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2882.0s)]
*  I'm going I'll see groups of high school or college girls laughing and chirping. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2885.0s)]
*  And just like and I'm just like, you know, it's like just giggling. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2891.0s)]
*  Just head back laughing. But we did so much of that. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2895.0s)]
*  That's what made me a comedian. The friends I had, there's such they were just really funny. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2898.0s)]
*  Had great sense humor. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2902.0s)]
*  And we just just started performing, just laughing, laughing, laughing. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2904.0s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes you lose that. But it's so fun to laugh. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2908.0s)]
*  Like on this scripted podcast, we had a we don't have to bring it up. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2911.0s)]
*  No, let's bring it up. I want to. Yes. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2916.0s)]
*  But we had a credit roll and Dex, my son Dex Carvey and Julian Matalich did so many things. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2917.0s)]
*  It was during the pandemic. They wore every hat. They're directing, producing. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2923.0s)]
*  So the credit roll at the end, I read it as a character, but they did so many things that it just hit me like a ton of bricks. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2927.0s)]
*  And it wasn't one of the hardest I've laughed in the last five years. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2933.0s)]
*  It's a character like this, co-directed by Julian Matalich and Dex Carvey, written by Dex Carvey and Julian Matalich, edited by Dex Carvey. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2936.0s)]
*  And it went on and on. But they literally had to wear all those hats in the pandemic. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2945.0s)]
*  We just did it at a table with a laptop. But that belly laughing is so valuable and so charming. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2949.0s)]
*  And you're right. Just just going with it. We had a little bit the other night right before that last 10 minutes. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2956.0s)]
*  10 minutes. I was really because it just getting silly. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2961.0s)]
*  You were in there. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2965.0s)]
*  Cock and balls. Oh I'm cock. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2966.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was it? Yeah. What was it? We're talking about having like an Australian. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2968.0s)]
*  It was like the Thunder from Down Under. Yeah. Thunder from Down Under. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2973.0s)]
*  But if you're two characters and you're the cheap. Me and Spade would be the guys. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2976.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're like it's a 2 p.m. little review and you'd be in Speedos. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2980.0s)]
*  And so you decided you spell it differently than cock and balls. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2984.0s)]
*  Basically, I'm cock. He's balls. Together we're cocking balls. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2988.0s)]
*  And then you start dancing. Yeah. Just as Spade do that. It'd be pretty funny. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2991.0s)]
*  And especially if one of them lost his cock and he is only balls, you know. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2995.0s)]
*  And that's why they had to do it. Wouldn't that be crazy? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=2999.0s)]
*  I'm not a cock. I'm only balls. He's only cock. Together we're only balls and only cock. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3003.0s)]
*  Sign on to www.onlycockonlyballs.com. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3011.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's anyway. I want to say cock and balls more on this pocket. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3015.0s)]
*  And there's any other one I've ever been on. He's cocking only balls. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3019.0s)]
*  But it's just idiots with super cocky. That's the funny part. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3023.0s)]
*  It's like, here we go. Here we go. Come watch us come see our own penises outside inside. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3026.0s)]
*  Do you think? I lost it in a lawnmower accident. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3035.0s)]
*  When I was a kid once, the guy next door was mowing the lawn. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3039.0s)]
*  And screaming and he cut off some of his toes. Right. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3043.0s)]
*  But the animal has got him. But the toe was out there later. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3048.0s)]
*  So then my brother Brad came out and put it in formaldehyde. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3051.0s)]
*  My mom saw it and said, we got to take it. We got to get to the, you know, take him to the place. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3054.0s)]
*  And they went into like a medical center. We just moved to this town. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3060.0s)]
*  And she went into a psychiatrist's office and she goes, there's a boy who's missing a toe in my car. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3064.0s)]
*  You know, they said, it's okay, lady. Just have a seat. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3069.0s)]
*  But Brad's kept that big toe. And I remember looking at it. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3072.0s)]
*  Wow. This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3076.0s)]

*  Yeah, I remember we found two fingers in the woods when it sounded like a peace sign. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3254.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3258.0s)]
*  And we were actually collecting cans and we found two fingers in the wood, in the woods. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3259.0s)]
*  What else happened? Did you grow up in, is it suburb or rural? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3263.0s)]
*  It was rural, but it wasn't redneck. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3267.0s)]
*  So I never had like any redneck stuff. We just had like a lot of poor people. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3269.0s)]
*  Like we used to watch dogs give birth and people would bet on how many whelping, how many dogs, how many babies were going to be in it. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3273.0s)]
*  Yeah. We grew up like a hamster breeding area. We had a dude not far from us that used to breed hamsters. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3280.0s)]
*  You know, it was big in our area. We had, I used to clean out wishing wells. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3286.0s)]
*  Our town had like apparently the most wishing wells per capita or something. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3291.0s)]
*  Is that because of religiosity or just Irishness, I guess? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3295.0s)]
*  I think people just love, you know, people just love having water hidden under the land. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3299.0s)]
*  I tell you, for me personally, when I had this bypass at 42, I'm incredible now. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3305.0s)]
*  You had a heart surgery? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3310.0s)]
*  Well, the heart's perfect, but the artery was blocked and I had to do a bypass and they did it. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3314.0s)]
*  They didn't do the right artery, but they didn't harm me, but I was fine. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3320.0s)]
*  But my Indian cardiologist, PK Shaw, did a, he went to Mother Teresa's grave site and did a prayer for me. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3323.0s)]
*  And then my Irish, super Irish Catholic mother-in-law born and raised in Dublin, she did a wishing well in Dublin. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3330.0s)]
*  And then now I'm just perfect. I don't know if it's true, but you know, I like, I leave a space in my head for spookiness. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3335.0s)]
*  Oh, me too. I think that's one thing that used to really, that's one thing used to help my imagination so much when I was young is that anything could be possible. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3341.0s)]
*  You know, you heard a lot more lore and stuff back then. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3350.0s)]
*  You know, that's one thing I really miss. Like now it's like everything is, like I asked my little niece, I said, you should use your imagination. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3353.0s)]
*  She goes, what is it? Imagination? She thought it was an app on your phone. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3361.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3365.0s)]
*  Well, not to dovetail again to this goofy, this brilliant scripted podcast, but that is bringing that back for mom and dad's driving around with their kid. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3367.0s)]
*  They're going to just going to hear a story. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3376.0s)]
*  So let's go into it. So you guys started it during the pandemic, right? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3378.0s)]
*  Yeah. Dex and Julian came to me with the idea of my son, Tom. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3382.0s)]
*  They all grew up with Twilight Zone because I had the mix. I had the DVD at my house in the 90s. So they're obsessed by it. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3386.0s)]
*  So we want, they want to make a show like it. And we just came to them. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3393.0s)]
*  We needed to have Rod and we knew it would be a big budget thing. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3396.0s)]
*  So we decided to do it scripted podcast and based on the Twilight Zone, but a comedy version. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3399.0s)]
*  And they went downtown. We went crazy. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3404.0s)]
*  So a scripted podcast. Yeah. Comedy podcast. Right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3406.0s)]
*  So it's basically where you, where you, it's where like you guys write it out in advance. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3409.0s)]
*  Right. Well, we wait. Here's what happened. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3414.0s)]
*  We tried to do it. We wrote it, recorded it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3417.0s)]
*  And it sounded like some people were on a pirate ship. We're like, wow, this is awesome. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3420.0s)]
*  Then we play it for people and they're just checking their phone. That's pretty good, dude. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3425.0s)]
*  Whatever we got. Holy fuck. This is not like old time radio. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3428.0s)]
*  You're competing for someone's mind where they got their phone in their hand. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3432.0s)]
*  So then we kept redoing it, restacking it, record it, write it, add effects better, re-record it, more music, more effects. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3436.0s)]
*  We had access to all this lush music in the Warner Brothers Library because we did it with Team Coco and they had a deal with Warner Brothers. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3445.0s)]
*  Big orchestral score. So you want to make it filmic and ear candy and intensity. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3451.0s)]
*  And then we go, but people get lost. They're listening to it in traffic. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3458.0s)]
*  Someone cuts them off. Fuck you. And then they lose the thread of the story. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3461.0s)]
*  So we go, clarity is king. So we had to put more exposition in a funny way. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3464.0s)]
*  So the narrator rots. So we loaded clarity. We loaded ear candy effects. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3467.0s)]
*  We made it potent, potent, potent to the point where then we loved it. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3471.0s)]
*  But it took like a year in a room and these guys, Dex and Julian, just became this two man band because it's pandemic time. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3475.0s)]
*  So they literally, they looked at it with a thousand songs. I don't know. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3481.0s)]
*  We got Dex. Dex is here. He's sitting in the- A thousand songs? Or how many songs? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3486.0s)]
*  Yeah. What's I ask him? And this is your son. This is your human son. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3490.0s)]
*  This is my human son. Yes. Dex Carvey and Julian Madelich. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3494.0s)]
*  This is the two man team that went crazy in a good way producing, writing and directing. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3498.0s)]
*  It was such a blast. It was such a good learning experience because you could listen back to something. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3504.0s)]
*  If it didn't work, you can just do it right over immediately. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3509.0s)]
*  Did it feel weird like using like, because your father obviously is a talented instrument that a lot of the world has used to have humor and to feel joy and, and to feel different things. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3512.0s)]
*  Did it ever feel weird as his son? Like, is there like a strangeness there? Like request, you know, trying to like, does that ever feel uncomfortable? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3523.0s)]
*  I didn't have a real relationship with my father. So I don't, you know, it's tough for me to gauge any of that, but I'm just curious about it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3532.0s)]
*  Oh, I think it can be super uncomfortable just because generally shows where it's a famous dad and his kids really suck. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3537.0s)]
*  It generally sucks. That's his common knowledge. Here come the kids, right? Yeah. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3544.0s)]
*  Yeah. Here comes Ronnie Tarantino. Let's see what he's got going on. Maybe you could stand up with that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3550.0s)]
*  I don't know. There you go. Yeah. And if we can't see you too, that's okay. As long as we can hear you. That's Julian there. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3555.0s)]
*  That's Julian with you. That's your partner there? Yeah. That's my childhood friend. I lived right next door. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3560.0s)]
*  He would come over and watch the Twilight Zone. Julian and they're the ones who really went downtown on this and went a little crazy. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3565.0s)]
*  We just went crazy with it, to be honest, Theo, because we could and we just, it wouldn't like a movie. You make it, you know, it sucks. You have to walk away. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3571.0s)]
*  We just kept redoing it. And then we learned the space. Now we think we reinvented it. And whoops, number four on, you know, it's doing very well. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3578.0s)]
*  You guys are number four on Apple Podcasts today anyway for a scripted comedy podcast, which is a very tough space. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3587.0s)]
*  So we were very proud of it and we love it. And it deals in emotionality too, in a subtle way. It has story arcs. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3593.0s)]
*  It has a filmic sense to it. And mostly the word packages and the rhythms of the characters, because that's what I harbor in, those were so much fun to do. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3601.0s)]
*  And Dex, did your father play all the characters? Did you play some of the characters? Did Julian play some of them? Who played what? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3610.0s)]
*  We got a few little ones. My dad did most of the voices, just because, again, it was like I don't want to have, you know, it's Dana's kid tries voices for the first time. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3615.0s)]
*  We really liked the show, so I just wanted to focus on the show and not about the people involved as much. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3626.0s)]
*  Did you enjoy, so a lot of producing and writing from your side? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3633.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think all, I mean, that was cool. I mean, it was, I'm not really that familiar with the whole writing stuff, but like this was the first project. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3637.0s)]
*  It's a sketch in its own way. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3645.0s)]
*  We just sat at a table. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3647.0s)]
*  Yeah, just stay on the mic. You're good? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3648.0s)]
*  Yeah, but basically we're riffing and we're at a impasse with the story. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3650.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3656.0s)]
*  And Dex or Julian would say something like, okay, the alien has to stay on Earth. What if he gets addicted to Earth food and he gained so much weight he can't get home on his spaceship? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3657.0s)]
*  So I'm like, oh shit, that's it. That's it. So they're writing in that kind of way. And then we're all rewriting for clarity and we all learn together. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3667.0s)]
*  I know a lot more about making film or telling stories now by doing this, but then they would do a rough edit. They would add effects. They would do music. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3674.0s)]
*  We'd work on it again together. And then everyone was wearing every hat because I would look up from the mic after doing a take at Dex and Julian and I would go by them and they might go, I think that last take or this take and we're picking takes. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3684.0s)]
*  And I just give them a lot of props because that's, I love crazy and I'm crazy. I mean, I don't, if I'm working on something like I'll draw a little bit or play a song, I'm as excited about that as being on Saturday Night Live. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3698.0s)]
*  It's a weird discovery. It's almost scary. That's all I care about. So this was all from the heart and not for money or fame. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3712.0s)]
*  It's just completely a message in a bottle that you hope people can get a little peace in their brains for a while. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3720.0s)]
*  And the weird place it's called? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3727.0s)]
*  It's called the Weird Place anywhere where you can get a podcast. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3728.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll put the link below so people can get a hold of it and check it out. Now is each episode different Dex or what's that like? Is it each episode like its own? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3731.0s)]
*  It's anthology. Yeah. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3739.0s)]
*  So anthology means what? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3740.0s)]
*  It's basic, three basic stories. The first one is about a nuclear submarine, 1966, that goes through a time portal and surfaces in 1738 and sees a pirate ship. They don't even know they've gone back in time. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3742.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3755.0s)]
*  And there's a whole story around that. The second one was this alien who has to come to Earth and befriend an earthling to get them to help him make bomb making materials. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3756.0s)]
*  So he tells this sweet old lady that that's what he eats on his planet, ammonium nitrate, nitroglycerin. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3765.0s)]
*  Could I have some ammonium nitrate, Sal? What do you all want that for? To eat because it's food. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3770.0s)]
*  So that one's a little funnier, but he's the one who gets so heavy he can't escape in the spaceship. They become friends. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3778.0s)]
*  And then the final one is about a guy who gets bullied by these guys and he goes to this this knickknack store and this strange, colorful character gives him a globe. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3783.0s)]
*  And it's a magic globe. And if you touch the globe, you affect the real world. So he touches the Eiffel Tower. He touches Paris. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3792.0s)]
*  And one day I will go to Paris. And then there's mayhem in Paris. So that one is really very Twilight Zone, really special. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3799.0s)]
*  There's a lot of songs and there's a companion piece called Talking Weird. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3806.0s)]
*  It's sort of an after show that Rod interviews some of the voice actors and there's some singing in that. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3811.0s)]
*  And Rod is your character, so people know. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3816.0s)]
*  Rod is we needed a Rod Serling character. And so we needed that gravitas and that voice to give us that vibe. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3819.0s)]
*  And the music's all from the 60s. There's no sex or violence, no real violence. And it's very 60s. It has an earnestness to it, you know, a sincerity to it. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3826.0s)]
*  It's not cynical. It's not dark. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3837.0s)]
*  And Rod Serling, so people know who that is. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3839.0s)]
*  That is a show in the 1960s called The Twilight Zone. And there's been reboots. Black Mirror was sort of a brilliant dark version of it. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3841.0s)]
*  And then Jordan Peele did The Twilight Zone. And so we just did our own thing and we kept it earnest and we kept it rotticized for our purposes. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3850.0s)]
*  So, you know, we did a lot of characters. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3860.0s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. That's him. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3862.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's him. Justin Theroux Jr. Look at him. Yeah. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3863.0s)]
*  And is he related to the Archbishop or whatever, the Canadian? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3867.0s)]
*  You think that's who he looks like? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3872.0s)]
*  Justin Theroux. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3874.0s)]
*  Well, I just keep thinking Justin Theroux for Hollywood out there should play Rod Serling in a biopic because I think he does look kind of like him. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3875.0s)]
*  If you could throw up Justin Theroux if you want. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3885.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's get a quick picture of Justin Theroux real quick. And then I got just one more question for Dex too. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3887.0s)]
*  And he loves older women. I think he's into. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3892.0s)]
*  Well, he was with Jennifer Aniston for a while, right? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3897.0s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm thinking of the Prime Minister of Canada. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3900.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. Justin Trudeau. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3903.0s)]
*  Trudeau. Yeah, yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3905.0s)]
*  Justin Trudeau. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3906.0s)]
*  So you thought he looks like Rod Serling. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3907.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3909.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. That's funny. Maybe they both do. Oh, that's funny. There you go. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3910.0s)]
*  He kind of does. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3914.0s)]
*  OK. Yeah, you could carry it off. But you could see that Justin Theroux, who's a brilliant. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3915.0s)]
*  Justin Trudeau. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3921.0s)]
*  Writer. Yeah. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3922.0s)]
*  And Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3923.0s)]
*  He looks like he still like he eats adult applesauce. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3927.0s)]
*  He does. He looks like an applesauce face. Yeah. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3931.0s)]
*  If his face was a fruit product, it wouldn't just be an apple. It'd be applesauce. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3934.0s)]
*  It'd be very the runny kind, not the good kind. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3938.0s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3941.0s)]
*  The shitty kind like high C. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3942.0s)]
*  You have to get you have to get Kool-Aid when you can't afford high C. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3944.0s)]
*  Well, there he is. Jesus. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3948.0s)]
*  Christ, thanks. Got his hands around the bun there. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3950.0s)]
*  All right. That's a good look for the leader of a large nation. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3953.0s)]
*  OK. To the double knuckle grip on some chicks ass. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3957.0s)]
*  That's what we need in our prime ministers. OK. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3961.0s)]
*  I can really buy IQ goes up when I become Dennis. Yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3964.0s)]
*  You know, I just know that he won't ever say anything directly. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3968.0s)]
*  It's his own poetry. OK. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3970.0s)]
*  Theo von there rocking the mullet. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3972.0s)]
*  That's a good look. Circus 2022. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3974.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Spent some money on the studio here. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3977.0s)]
*  What is this? Six by eight. Looks like a prison cell or something. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3980.0s)]
*  OK. Dressing up with the psychedelic pictures. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3983.0s)]
*  OK. Good. You put down the hash pipe, Vaughn. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3987.0s)]
*  OK. Do a podcast. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3990.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's just he's just a brilliant comic. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3993.0s)]
*  Awesome. I went on his show one time. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3996.0s)]
*  Did you? Yeah, he's an amazing improviser. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=3998.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Was it fun? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4001.0s)]
*  All right. One more question for Dex. Let me get it. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4003.0s)]
*  Don't forget. Yeah. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4005.0s)]
*  Is this is this something that you guys think you would do more of? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4007.0s)]
*  Or what did it did? Did it feel like to kind of harrowing? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4009.0s)]
*  Oh, I would love to do it again. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4013.0s)]
*  It was pretty intense just because it was just three of us. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4016.0s)]
*  And we also really it took like half the time just to figure it out. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4020.0s)]
*  We just didn't really know how to. Yeah, it's a lot. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4024.0s)]
*  I'm sure it sounds like a lot. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4026.0s)]
*  I think we and Julian can talk for a sec, too. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4027.0s)]
*  I think that we did figure it out. We have a work process now. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4030.0s)]
*  It might be a little bit like first time you do a podcast. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4034.0s)]
*  And now you kind of know, you know, I'm learning with Spade still. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4036.0s)]
*  But we we could go faster. We would need a little more help. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4039.0s)]
*  You know, maybe a secondary mixer. We hired one. Yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4043.0s)]
*  We had Michael Gordon from Conan. Great writer. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4046.0s)]
*  We had he's doing some assisting for us, but we were basically a three man band. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4051.0s)]
*  But we could move faster. It's like this is proof of concept. Right. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4055.0s)]
*  And we may release an episode soon. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4059.0s)]
*  We had an episode that we held that Tom thought of. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4062.0s)]
*  It was about Valdemar Putin goes through a wormhole and ends up in a guy's bedroom in rural Mississippi. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4065.0s)]

*  So that's that's maybe a bonus episode coming out based on popular demand. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4089.0s)]
*  OK. Yep. That's cool, man. Yeah. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4094.0s)]
*  I think I would love to see Russia versus Mississippi. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4097.0s)]
*  So I would love to watch it. I watch that on pay-per-view even. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4100.0s)]

*  Let me think about it. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4280.0s)]
*  I don't do this one anymore, but if you need it, you can have it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4281.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4283.0s)]

*  Which was an invented idea. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4415.0s)]

*  I have to ask. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4438.0s)]
*  One time we got under this blanket and things were like a little strange, but it wasn't anything too crazy. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4439.0s)]
*  And our buddy and my buddy was there too. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4444.0s)]
*  It's just almost like a Native American type of deal. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4446.0s)]
*  You know, it wasn't Native American like you were under the blankets like a tent. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4452.0s)]
*  And then things started, a tent started to form in your pants and you didn't know what it meant and you ran away. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4453.0s)]
*  We were all just kind of chatting naked under this blanket and then everybody started getting an erection. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4457.0s)]
*  I think nobody wanted to like admit it, you know, so everybody was just kind of pretending like they weren't getting an erection. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4461.0s)]
*  We were more innocent. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4466.0s)]
*  We would make my sister play waitress, like on a rainy day. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4467.0s)]
*  You go, she wanted to play with us. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4470.0s)]
*  Now you can't. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4472.0s)]
*  You go, but you could play waitress. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4473.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4474.0s)]
*  So you make us root beer floats and stuff and she'd bring him in like a waitress. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4475.0s)]
*  You go, yeah, okay. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4477.0s)]
*  Clean it up. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4478.0s)]
*  You know, next day, can we get a cheeseburger with cheese? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4479.0s)]
*  She became a really good fry cook for a while. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4482.0s)]
*  She wanted to be our friend so bad. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4484.0s)]
*  We just put her to work. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4486.0s)]
*  I mean, this was the rough and tumble carves. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4487.0s)]
*  This is like the sons of Katie Elder. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4490.0s)]
*  I mean, we were just badass weirdos building forts, tents, fighting. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4492.0s)]
*  Was it weird? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4498.0s)]
*  So whenever you started to have like a lot of popularity in your life from work and stuff, was it tough with your relationship with your brothers? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4499.0s)]
*  Like, did you ever get scared? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4506.0s)]
*  Like, oh, this is going to take away because I've felt that in my own life. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4507.0s)]
*  Not felt it, but I guess I've worried about it. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4510.0s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4513.0s)]
*  That's going to take away or it's going to make my brother think I don't care about him as much or something. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4514.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4518.0s)]
*  Well, nothing changed on my side, but my brother Scott had a sense of humor about it. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4519.0s)]
*  He would introduce himself after I got something out of fame as Dana Carvey's brother. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4523.0s)]
*  Hi, what are you? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4527.0s)]
*  My name is Dana Carvey's brother. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4528.0s)]
*  My other name is Scott Carvey, but my primary name is Dana Carvey's brother. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4530.0s)]
*  So we just laughed about it and just kept in touch. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4534.0s)]
*  I would do these things called Lost Weekends to stay in touch with my friends, my high school friends, my brother when I was, you know, peak SNL. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4537.0s)]
*  So we'd all go to Vegas. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4545.0s)]
*  Everyone gets their own room. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4546.0s)]
*  We go see shows. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4548.0s)]
*  We went out to Lake Mead when it was there. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4549.0s)]
*  Everyone would get a wave runner. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4551.0s)]
*  We'd have beer and sandwiches in the front and we'd go out there with crystal clear and we'd go to islands and dive off rocks and just have a blast. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4552.0s)]
*  So I just went the other way. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4560.0s)]
*  I made a lot of new friends, you know, in show business, but I have a lot of core friends. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4561.0s)]
*  And, you know, fame is a motherfucker, you know? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4567.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no way around it. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4571.0s)]
*  It's just very strange. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4573.0s)]
*  And you're still on the upslope. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4574.0s)]
*  So your brother, did you look up to him? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4577.0s)]
*  He was older. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4580.0s)]
*  Yeah, not as kids. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4581.0s)]
*  I didn't. But as adults, I really have, you know, he's really, really special guy. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4582.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I don't worry. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4585.0s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4587.0s)]
*  It was just sometimes I just don't want him to think that I don't know. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4588.0s)]
*  I think we do a pretty decent job. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4592.0s)]
*  It's just weird. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4594.0s)]
*  And then the money comes. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4595.0s)]
*  I remember just I had the thing like I'd go to a mall and I think everywhere I look, I could buy it anywhere I look, I could buy it, you know, and I one time went in and I got like a Mercedes because like an Elvis move at a mall. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4596.0s)]
*  No, not at a mall dealership that I got. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4608.0s)]
*  I got my left the mall and I pointed at this one. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4611.0s)]
*  It was like a Mercedes coupe, but I realized later on it had a plastic windshield. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4614.0s)]
*  It was like 125,000 be like 250 now. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4619.0s)]
*  So I turned it back in and I got a big giant Mercedes, giant SLE 550 huge thing. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4621.0s)]
*  And I was going into 7-eleven just in the valley and people were looking at me. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4628.0s)]
*  So then I just went to a Honda pilot ever since then. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4633.0s)]
*  I like to get rid of stuff. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4636.0s)]
*  I don't want I have one car, one wife, you know, you know, it's like I don't need a lot of things. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4637.0s)]
*  I like guitars. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4642.0s)]
*  I like things I can interact with, you know, a woman, a guitar, a piano, a swimming pool, you know, things that are stuff that work. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4643.0s)]
*  Well, I can't get that excited about a chair and just look at the chair. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4652.0s)]
*  That's all right. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4655.0s)]
*  My wife does. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4656.0s)]
*  You know, it's just an interior designer mind and aesthetic mind. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4657.0s)]
*  I'm more in the internal world, but it's not self-congratulatory. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4660.0s)]
*  But going back full circle to your brother. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4664.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's so it's you could feel maybe a little guilt about it because you're changing the dynamic of how he's perceived, you know, which is normal. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4666.0s)]
*  It's not. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4675.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's you. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4676.0s)]
*  I don't want him to ever. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4677.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4678.0s)]
*  I just didn't want my brother to think that he felt that I ever felt like I was more important than him or something like that. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4679.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4684.0s)]
*  And maybe that's all egotistical to even think that way. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4685.0s)]
*  You know, it's you're just a passenger in this. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4687.0s)]
*  So you just did this. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4690.0s)]
*  I don't even know what your resume was before you did this. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4691.0s)]
*  And then you got really successful, extraordinarily successful. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4694.0s)]
*  And that's just a train you're riding. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4698.0s)]
*  You couldn't will it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4700.0s)]
*  But you were active. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4702.0s)]
*  You did this necessary steps. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4703.0s)]
*  But this lane that you're in now where it's Theo Von World and you run a you're a CEO of a business and you don't bow down to anyone. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4705.0s)]
*  No one tells you you're fired. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4712.0s)]
*  This is awesome. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4714.0s)]
*  I'm glad I live long enough to see this. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4715.0s)]
*  That's us doing this this scripted podcast with just a laptop in the effects and all the things we could get for ourselves. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4718.0s)]
*  It's such an equal playing field for art and creativity. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4725.0s)]
*  And you're like one of the big people out there that have done this. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4729.0s)]
*  You and Tim Dillon and others. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4734.0s)]
*  But it's a magic world. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4735.0s)]
*  And you can't help that you're successful. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4737.0s)]
*  I'll be therapist for a second. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4739.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not nothing. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4741.0s)]
*  You just ride in the train that you know. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4743.0s)]
*  And what happens over time, I'll tell you this much. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4745.0s)]
*  Everyone's all excited. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4748.0s)]
*  You're famous. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4750.0s)]
*  And then it gets boring. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4751.0s)]
*  Yeah, it might be 10 more years. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4752.0s)]
*  But at some point, it's full circle back to Theo. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4754.0s)]
*  Just like and you're still going and doing stuff. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4756.0s)]
*  But like been there, done that. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4758.0s)]
*  They're used to all the stuff. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4760.0s)]
*  But in early heady days of it, you're picking up checks, you're renting cars, you know, and it's just a little bit of a whoopty doo. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4761.0s)]
*  I mean, I I sort of got famous in a sense at 31 or 32. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4768.0s)]
*  And so I had a long runway before that. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4773.0s)]
*  You know, if you make it as a child actor, that's that's fucked up. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4776.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4779.0s)]
*  I mean, it just killed that one kid. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4780.0s)]
*  You know, you saw that Aaron Carter. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4782.0s)]
*  He just yeah, you know, he drowned out. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4783.0s)]
*  He drowned out. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4786.0s)]
*  I think they said he was Huff and Duster, which I've done. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4787.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie about that. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4791.0s)]
*  What is that specifically Huff and Duster? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4792.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4794.0s)]
*  A.S.D.F.L. Sam or whatever, you know, whatever it is. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4795.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4798.0s)]
*  You know, you know, Duster. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4799.0s)]
*  But yeah, I've been there. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4800.0s)]
*  I've hit it before. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4802.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4803.0s)]
*  But I think it's sad to see what you know, he was a child star and then makes you know, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4804.0s)]
*  he's got six or seven service animals. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4809.0s)]
*  I mean, he had a damn, you know, he was in the damn Iditarod. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4811.0s)]
*  It looked like the guy had so many service and then he was getting tattoos and neck tattoos [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4815.0s)]
*  and just once it creeps up on the face, you just feel like it's a cry for help. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4819.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, what can I put on my face? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4824.0s)]
*  It'll make me OK. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4828.0s)]
*  And the interesting part about therapy is just checking your thoughts. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=4829.0s)]

*  And then you'd come into the, the, the studio and you'd hear him down the hall. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5149.0s)]
*  How long is Rodford Robert Redford been in the business? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5154.0s)]
*  He's one of those guys who talked. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5157.0s)]
*  We ran out of air. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5158.0s)]
*  How long has Robert Redford been in the business? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5159.0s)]
*  10 years. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5162.0s)]
*  I've been in the business 62 years. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5163.0s)]
*  How old are you? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5165.0s)]
*  62 in two months. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5166.0s)]
*  I mean, he's one of those guys with a baby. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5167.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5169.0s)]
*  He had so many, he would said this a thousand times, literally, literally. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5170.0s)]
*  He would say this every day. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5174.0s)]
*  I was the, which he was, he was the number star, number one star in the world in 1937. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5175.0s)]
*  I was the number one star in the world. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5180.0s)]
*  You hear me? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5182.0s)]
*  Bang. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5183.0s)]
*  The world. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5184.0s)]
*  And he did that. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5187.0s)]
*  You hear me? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5188.0s)]
*  Bang. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5189.0s)]
*  The world. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5190.0s)]
*  I swear. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5191.0s)]
*  But he had, finally had money. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5192.0s)]
*  He was doing a Broadway show on our show. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5195.0s)]
*  He went to the racetrack all week. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5197.0s)]
*  It was old show business. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5199.0s)]
*  We had a guy who was five feet tall. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5200.0s)]
*  His head was, and we would just rehearse with him all week. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5202.0s)]
*  But Mickey would have like $5,000 and he'd put it in front of my face. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5205.0s)]
*  He goes, think I can afford lunch. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5209.0s)]
*  And he had a 38. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5213.0s)]
*  He didn't like the script. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5215.0s)]
*  He would bring it out and he throw the script. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5216.0s)]
*  This script is kaka. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5219.0s)]
*  And he's wavering this 38 around and he puts it back in. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5221.0s)]
*  He goes, they're not going to get me. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5224.0s)]
*  Who? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5226.0s)]
*  He was going to kill Juan Corona, this serial killer. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5227.0s)]
*  Before this, I was going to go to see Juan Corona. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5230.0s)]
*  And I'm going to say, you know who I am? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5233.0s)]
*  I'm Mickey Rooney. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5236.0s)]
*  I was going to plug him full of holes. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5237.0s)]
*  He was the craziest, greatest. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5240.0s)]
*  He would play a piano because he was a jack of all trades. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5243.0s)]
*  He would hit these piano chords. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5246.0s)]
*  He goes, this is Steven Sondheim's favorite song. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5247.0s)]
*  But then we bonded. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5251.0s)]
*  He thought I was a hack and an idiot. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5252.0s)]
*  But then I was able to do Jimmy Stewart for him. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5254.0s)]
*  So that's when I got him. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5258.0s)]
*  I go, how you doing, Mick? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5260.0s)]
*  Yeah, good to say. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5262.0s)]
*  And said he was an impressionist too. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5264.0s)]
*  He's like Sammy Davis Jr. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5266.0s)]
*  Just could do anything. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5267.0s)]
*  So we got going toward the end and Nathan and I, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5269.0s)]
*  there's so much more to it, but Meg Ryan played my girlfriend. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5272.0s)]
*  Scatman Carruthers. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5276.0s)]
*  First time I really befriended this beautiful, older black man from the [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5278.0s)]
*  South, I think, or whatever, but Scatman Carruthers. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5284.0s)]
*  And he was like such a poet. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5287.0s)]
*  My brother came out to visit me and he'd say, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5290.0s)]
*  see that man over there with the broom? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5293.0s)]
*  He's an artist. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5295.0s)]
*  We're all artists. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5296.0s)]
*  And he played the ukulele and he'd walk around in the studio. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5298.0s)]
*  It had an unmarked bottle this big of pills. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5301.0s)]
*  And he just chugged some vitamins. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5303.0s)]
*  I'm going to a hundred. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5305.0s)]
*  I'm doing Mickey now. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5307.0s)]
*  I'm going to a hundred. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5308.0s)]
*  So what happened was he had, he smoked a lot of weed. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5309.0s)]
*  It was always weed everywhere. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5313.0s)]
*  Scatman? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5314.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5315.0s)]
*  So during the break, I went back to San Francisco. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5316.0s)]
*  There he is. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5318.0s)]
*  He was the nicest guy. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5319.0s)]
*  So Scott and I got like 10, we got like two lids of Colombian pot. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5320.0s)]
*  Those days you'd fly with it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5325.0s)]
*  I guess we put in the suitcase. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5326.0s)]
*  We gave it to Scatman in Rockefeller Center. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5328.0s)]
*  This is 1981. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5331.0s)]
*  Mickey Rooney's around. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5332.0s)]
*  Scat, here you go. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5333.0s)]
*  Next day he's in the elevator with me. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5334.0s)]
*  He says, because you know, he grew up during secrecy with pot. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5336.0s)]
*  He said, the music was good. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5339.0s)]
*  Might I get a pound? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5342.0s)]
*  So it's the best pot he ever had. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5344.0s)]
*  And he could look at, not even look at you and roll a joint. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5347.0s)]
*  And it was closed on both ends. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5349.0s)]
*  So then after the show got canceled, he was living in Van Nuys. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5351.0s)]
*  And so Scott and I brought a bag of Santa Cruz Colombian pot. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5355.0s)]
*  We didn't even smoke pot at that point, maybe a teeny bit, but we brought it to him. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5359.0s)]
*  He played ukulele. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5362.0s)]
*  He goes, I got a bad wheel. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5364.0s)]
*  It was just so such a sweet, such a sweet guy. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5366.0s)]
*  That was a cool part of that story of meeting him and hanging out with Scatman. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5369.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5373.0s)]
*  There's nothing better that feels better than giving like good weed to a black guy, I feel like, too. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5374.0s)]
*  There's just something as a white guy that about that, that feels good. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5378.0s)]
*  I guess so. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5381.0s)]
*  I just, you know, I didn't, I grew up, you know, mostly as a white neighborhood and we had an integrated high school. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5382.0s)]
*  When I was 14, I was standing there, Caramont High School, 2500 kids. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5388.0s)]
*  And they brought all the kids in from East Palo Alto. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5392.0s)]
*  So these bus buses showed up and 500 black kids came in to the school. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5394.0s)]
*  And all I was worried about was they think I was prejudiced. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5399.0s)]
*  I'd say something that sounded prejudiced. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5402.0s)]
*  But then, you know, we all, they all ran on the team. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5404.0s)]
*  We all hung out. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5406.0s)]
*  But Scatman was just sort of, he's just a poet, you know, just everything he said was poetry. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5407.0s)]
*  You know, some of these people like. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5412.0s)]
*  Yeah, my dad had this fella named, his last name Wilson, right? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5413.0s)]
*  And he had a, one of his limbs was shortened out, right? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5416.0s)]
*  He probably had that, you know, we had that damn sand wedge on him. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5419.0s)]
*  He had that pitching wedge on his left. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5422.0s)]
*  And so they would, they would cut a bunch of, he had a bunch of pieces of tire cut and just kind of either glued or nailed onto the bottom of that shoe. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5424.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5432.0s)]
*  And he would stand, sometimes when he didn't have his good shoe or whatever, he would stand on a little stoop. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5433.0s)]
*  So he looked even from far off, right? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5438.0s)]
*  It was just a big, he didn't want to be uneven, you know? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5440.0s)]
*  Was he a vet or was it just congenital or an accident? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5443.0s)]
*  He just probably, I don't know. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5446.0s)]
*  He got raised in an area on an uneven surface. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5448.0s)]
*  I have no idea what happened to him, right? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5450.0s)]
*  But they, he used to put, he would hang out with my father and he would, you know, go get lunch for him and stuff. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5452.0s)]
*  Sometimes my dad worked in a French quarter for a little while selling, I think some kind of bullshit, but this guy would help him out. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5461.0s)]
*  And he would put cinnamon on his palm of his hand and let us lick it off when we were children. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5469.0s)]
*  You never forget that. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5474.0s)]
*  My grandmother would bring date cookies and stuff and that seemed exciting. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5475.0s)]
*  Any old person somewhere to treat anything, they hook you up, let you lick their hand or whatever. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5479.0s)]
*  It just made you feel a partisan. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5484.0s)]
*  One thing I appreciate, like my mother had a friend that was just from Montana. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5487.0s)]
*  Her name was Cookie. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5491.0s)]
*  So she's an old person who just giggled all the time. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5493.0s)]
*  When you didn't meet a bitter, you just, I met a lot of bitter people. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5495.0s)]
*  They didn't like being old and my date, you know, is like, okay, show business especially, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5499.0s)]
*  or life is a bitterness factory. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5504.0s)]
*  So be one of those cheerful. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5506.0s)]
*  Don't be mad at someone for being young because James Ferentino was mad at me for being young when I did Blue Thunder. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5508.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5514.0s)]
*  So I was in this mock helicopter, another show that I did. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5515.0s)]
*  He was purely doing massive amounts of coke. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5517.0s)]
*  He had a styrofoam cup, this big a straight vodka. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5520.0s)]
*  When we were in the mock helicopter with our helmets on acting. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5523.0s)]
*  And then I got fired from that. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5526.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5529.0s)]
*  People would do that then because they don't do that now. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5530.0s)]
*  I know it was so obvious because he got out of the chopper. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5532.0s)]
*  His dealer was over there. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5535.0s)]
*  And then I thought I'll just take a sip of water. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5537.0s)]
*  I was so young and naive. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5539.0s)]
*  He would take, he was like Scarface. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5540.0s)]
*  He'd take the script out and he just pounded on the instrument panel and the fanc helicopter were like 10 feet in the air and they're blowing steam at us. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5541.0s)]
*  You know, okay. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5548.0s)]
*  And we're pretending like there we are. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5549.0s)]
*  I love this. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5551.0s)]
*  Got a great haircut. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5552.0s)]
*  Dude, you do. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5553.0s)]
*  I could definitely see if a gay dude rolled up, bro. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5554.0s)]
*  You are toast. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5558.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5561.0s)]
*  I was Jaffa. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5562.0s)]
*  Just another first look at that. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5563.0s)]
*  That I'll throw a punch. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5564.0s)]
*  Look like the same guy. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5565.0s)]
*  Well, that was a while back. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5567.0s)]
*  But yeah, no, that's me being the macho guy. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5569.0s)]
*  But I just had lines in the back of the chopper. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5571.0s)]
*  You'd say Jaffa incoming jam him. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5573.0s)]
*  And I would say, I am jamming. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5575.0s)]
*  I am jamming, sir. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5577.0s)]
*  You know, I wanted to be, I wanted to be Richard Pryor or something or Steve Martin. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5578.0s)]
*  I'm in this. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5582.0s)]
*  They play that at so many bath houses on loop, dude. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5583.0s)]
*  I am jamming. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5585.0s)]
*  I am jamming. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5587.0s)]
*  I am jamming. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5588.0s)]
*  I bet you were on so many. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5589.0s)]
*  You were not getting paid for this. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5592.0s)]
*  I'm not jamming, but someone else is. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5594.0s)]
*  I think you need to sell, if you sold tickets in specific areas, man, you would really, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5596.0s)]
*  really crush. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5601.0s)]
*  But he would call me at night. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5602.0s)]
*  What are they saying about me? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5603.0s)]
*  Well, that you're doing drugs and you're out of your mind. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5604.0s)]
*  Okay, just checking. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5607.0s)]
*  See you later. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5608.0s)]
*  But I got fired. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5609.0s)]
*  They put me in the helicopter with that suit on and then they, they fired me. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5610.0s)]
*  They said, come on down. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5615.0s)]
*  The whole crew was there. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5616.0s)]
*  And I had to come down the ladder wearing that. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5617.0s)]
*  And I didn't think, oh, you're fired. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5619.0s)]
*  I am now. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5621.0s)]
*  They could have told me before I got in the monkey suit. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5622.0s)]
*  So I got to do it's like old show called Brandon. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5624.0s)]
*  I'm walking across everybody, you know, kind of waving humiliated. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5626.0s)]
*  I go to the wardrobe guy who I kind of befriended and I'm kind of shook up and I go, man, I'm [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5630.0s)]
*  funny. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5635.0s)]
*  I can do stuff. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5636.0s)]
*  And he put his hand on my shoulder like, sure, kid, it's okay, kid, you know. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5637.0s)]
*  And then I ran into him after us and now he goes, God, you warm right. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5640.0s)]
*  I didn't fucking, you know. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5644.0s)]
*  So I got revenge, but that was another crazy, I had some crazy people, you know, experiences. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5645.0s)]
*  But did you ever try out for MacGyver? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5650.0s)]
*  That makes me think about that. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5652.0s)]
*  Looking at that show and then seeing you, it seemed like they almost would have put you [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5653.0s)]
*  on there. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5656.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5657.0s)]
*  At some point I stopped because what they did was they were giving me 7,500 a week and [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5658.0s)]
*  I'm from middle class family. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5662.0s)]
*  I was a lot of money. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5664.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5665.0s)]
*  So I was like doing all this stuff was a waste of time. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5666.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, I was doing standup. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5668.0s)]
*  So finally I got, they offered me Funster Hall. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5670.0s)]
*  It was like a punky Brewster spinoff. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5675.0s)]
*  So the pilot was going to be 30,000 in 1984. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5678.0s)]
*  A lot of money. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5682.0s)]
*  So I just thought, nah, can't do this anymore. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5683.0s)]
*  So then all I did was clubs. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5685.0s)]
*  Oh, cause you were making too much money touring. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5687.0s)]
*  Well, I was just in comedy clubs. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5689.0s)]
*  I was mostly Seattle. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5690.0s)]
*  Bay Area had like five full-time clubs. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5691.0s)]
*  So I started going, you know, I started headlining. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5694.0s)]
*  I was headlining, but even bigger rooms and I was, I was making plenty of money. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5697.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5701.0s)]
*  You know, 2000 a week. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5702.0s)]
*  And so I just did that for two years. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5703.0s)]
*  And then I did one final thing that was different was a movie called tough guys with Burt [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5706.0s)]
*  Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5712.0s)]
*  So they became my buddies. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5714.0s)]
*  That was weird. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5715.0s)]
*  I was the third wheel in that movie. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5716.0s)]
*  Kirk Douglas is, he just passed. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5717.0s)]
*  He passed. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5720.0s)]
*  He was made to 102. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5721.0s)]
*  He was the dad, huh? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5722.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5724.0s)]
*  Kirk Douglas. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5725.0s)]
*  He talked like this and he's a ton of great movies and Burt Lancaster. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5726.0s)]
*  These were like, this is like working with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt or something, you [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5732.0s)]
*  know, and so Michael Landon. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5737.0s)]
*  Do you ever work with? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5739.0s)]
*  No, I would love there we go again. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5740.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5742.0s)]
*  Look, look, I was the pro. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5743.0s)]
*  I was the straight man again. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5744.0s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5746.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, we're gonna rob a bank. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5749.0s)]
*  They were Kirk Douglas. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5750.0s)]
*  When he saw me, I go, I play him Richie. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5751.0s)]
*  Kirk Douglas said, well, you're perfect. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5753.0s)]
*  You look exactly like Richie. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5755.0s)]
*  And then Burt Lancaster said, how many movies have you done? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5758.0s)]
*  I go, well, this is my first. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5761.0s)]
*  You've done one. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5763.0s)]
*  I've done 72. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5764.0s)]
*  So that's the way they talk. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5765.0s)]
*  You can look it up. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5768.0s)]
*  So look at all this shit I did. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5769.0s)]
*  It's a different time. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5772.0s)]
*  I'm on SNL as the church lady eight months later. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5773.0s)]
*  I mean, I just came out of nowhere. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5776.0s)]
*  What? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5778.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5779.0s)]
*  But they were, it was a thrill being around them and listening and tell the stories. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5780.0s)]
*  Jack Nicklaus had won the Masters golf at age 46 and people thought, and they're like, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5784.0s)]
*  I had pimples at 46. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5789.0s)]
*  46 isn't old. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5791.0s)]
*  It's not even, not even middle aged. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5793.0s)]
*  And they talk like that. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5796.0s)]
*  And eventually I started doing this thing, which I, it's politically incorrect. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5798.0s)]
*  You can cut it out, but just for my own amusement, late night writers room stuff, I did them as lovers. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5802.0s)]
*  You know, Kirk and Burt. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5809.0s)]
*  And I don't really like blue humor, but I thought their voices would blend so funny. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5810.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5814.0s)]
*  The comedy was about the rhythm and the vernacular. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5815.0s)]
*  I want you and I want you now. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5819.0s)]
*  I need to have you. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5824.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5826.0s)]
*  Don't rush me. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5827.0s)]
*  Two men having fun. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5828.0s)]
*  Doesn't mean we're gay. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5829.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5830.0s)]
*  Do what you got to do. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5831.0s)]
*  Don't keep bucking around like that, son. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5833.0s)]
*  I only got so much play down there. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5835.0s)]
*  You keep bucking around like that. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5837.0s)]
*  I got to pull out and splooge all over your backside. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5839.0s)]
*  So that was the poem that made love. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5841.0s)]
*  It's throw up in a parking garage. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5844.0s)]
*  So I would do 20 minute versions of this for the writers room. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5846.0s)]
*  Could you Burton Kirk? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5849.0s)]
*  And I did it on an HBO special, but I do it with love. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5850.0s)]
*  It's in love. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5854.0s)]
*  It's because I would just go so far with it. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5855.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know why I need you, but I want all of it tonight. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5857.0s)]
*  You won't. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5862.0s)]
*  So what I did was then I made it into, they're just going to wrestle. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5863.0s)]
*  And I made some tapes for friends and sent it to Bill Hader. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5866.0s)]
*  I'd like you to come over to my house. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5869.0s)]
*  Three, five, nine, Cannon Drive. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5871.0s)]

*  I'll be there with Bell's on. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5875.0s)]
*  There's a gate off the side. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5876.0s)]
*  The code is seven, five, four pound. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5877.0s)]
*  We're going to wrestle. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5880.0s)]
*  We're going to wrestle naked style. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5882.0s)]
*  I'm looking forward to it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5884.0s)]
*  Would you like me to bring anything? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5885.0s)]
*  Lemonade. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5887.0s)]

*  We'll lather up and then we'll wrestle. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5890.0s)]
*  First man out of the ring loses. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5893.0s)]
*  I look forward to it. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5895.0s)]
*  Just naked. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5896.0s)]
*  I might be wearing a diaper. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5897.0s)]
*  Four, five, five, Cannon Drive. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5899.0s)]
*  I'll be there at 4 p.m. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5901.0s)]
*  Make it 415. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5902.0s)]
*  I got to get ready for the rhythm. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5904.0s)]
*  So it's just me having a party with those rhythms. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5906.0s)]
*  Because when I do this stuff, I'm the audience in my head too. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5908.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make myself laugh. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5911.0s)]
*  So that's, I've been canceled three times. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5913.0s)]
*  That's great to be the audience in your own head. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5915.0s)]
*  Aren't you a little bit sometimes if you're in a role and you're doing bits and it's packed [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5919.0s)]
*  and you're rolling and you're doing it a little bit better or a little bit different than you ever have. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5923.0s)]
*  So you're turning yourself on going back to the beginning of the podcast. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5929.0s)]
*  And what does that do? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5933.0s)]
*  Turns on the audience. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5935.0s)]
*  If you get to turn yourself on. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5936.0s)]
*  But that's all I'm trying to do all the time. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5938.0s)]
*  I did Biden last night on Kimmel. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5941.0s)]
*  I was just trying to get that feeling of a rhythm that makes me laugh. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5949.0s)]

*  Come on. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5951.0s)]
*  Let's get real. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5952.0s)]
*  You can't. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5953.0s)]
*  I'm not getting around here. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5954.0s)]
*  You know, it's like the you know, we're all well endowed by our creator and all men. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5955.0s)]
*  So believe all men are created equally with liberty and jump start job suits for all manmade kind. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5961.0s)]
*  You're ridiculous. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5967.0s)]
*  No joke of race. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5968.0s)]
*  Cri-Cri-Cri-Critin Clearwater. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5970.0s)]
*  Her color balloons. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5972.0s)]
*  I walked on the moon. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5973.0s)]
*  You know, he yells. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5976.0s)]
*  Walked on the moon with Lance Armstrong. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5977.0s)]
*  He says, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5979.0s)]
*  It was cold and dark. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5982.0s)]
*  We got home. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5983.0s)]
*  The grace of God. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5984.0s)]
*  President Harris was there. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5985.0s)]
*  I'm Joe Biden. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5986.0s)]
*  So I was just kind of trying to find a character and a rhythm because Trump is so easy. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5987.0s)]
*  I'm going to make an announcement soon. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5991.0s)]
*  You're going to love it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5993.0s)]
*  I'm going to say things like you wouldn't believe. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5994.0s)]
*  And I know how to say things. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5995.0s)]
*  People don't want me to say it, but I'm going to say it pretty soon. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5996.0s)]
*  And we're going to do it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=5999.0s)]
*  And you're going to be happy like you wouldn't believe. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6000.0s)]
*  So they're just fun, fun rhythms. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6001.0s)]
*  You know, I did one as Obama as a preschool teacher. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6003.0s)]
*  Jack and Jill went up the hill. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6008.0s)]
*  Jill decided she wanted to become a Jack and Jack decided he wanted to become a Joe. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6011.0s)]
*  It's a teachable moment. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6016.0s)]
*  So anyway, that's all these are just rhythms. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6017.0s)]
*  I'm still working on. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6019.0s)]
*  I did them on Kimmel, but I like to do them on the O'Von. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6020.0s)]
*  Is it? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6022.0s)]

*  Got to kill you. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6074.0s)]

*  Hold on. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6088.0s)]
*  Let me try again. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6089.0s)]
*  They said it would take a man 600 years to get out of this. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6090.0s)]
*  But Andy Dufresne did it in less than 20. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6094.0s)]

*  Is it weird? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6104.0s)]

*  What are you talking about? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6167.0s)]
*  It's like a it's like I walk through this thing. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6168.0s)]
*  It's like a what it's like a tall rectangle like a what is this? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6171.0s)]
*  It's a doorway. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6179.0s)]
*  But like he would just talk about like, yeah, this room is just men and there's men peeing in there. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6181.0s)]

*  Have you guys seen this thing? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6190.0s)]
*  He did a thing and I don't know if John has talked about this. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6191.0s)]
*  John Lovitz. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6194.0s)]
*  But so it's like, yeah, he had a gambling issue, right? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6195.0s)]
*  Hey, John, give me, give me, give me. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6198.0s)]
*  Come on. He did his act. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6200.0s)]
*  John's going on. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6201.0s)]
*  Give me eight hundred dollars. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6202.0s)]
*  I got a gamble. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6203.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6204.0s)]
*  You know, so John's like, OK. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6205.0s)]
*  So the next day, John goes, you know, can I have my eight hundred dollars? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6206.0s)]
*  He goes, no, I don't have eight hundred dollars. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6210.0s)]
*  He goes, well, you owe it to me. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6212.0s)]
*  Why are you so mad? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6214.0s)]
*  I lost eight thousand dollars. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6215.0s)]
*  You only lost eight hundred dollars. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6217.0s)]
*  Why are you so angry? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6219.0s)]
*  He just turned it on him. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6220.0s)]
*  And John was like, John, Norm would always fuck with him and say, I'm a better stand. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6221.0s)]
*  No, he goes, I'm a better stand than you. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6227.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like a better stand up than you are. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6229.0s)]
*  You haven't done it longer. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6232.0s)]
*  And Lovitz would get so mad. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6233.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6234.0s)]
*  Well, you owe it to me. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6235.0s)]
*  That's the best that he does. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6237.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6239.0s)]
*  John has his own character. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6240.0s)]
*  He doesn't even know where it came from. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6241.0s)]
*  Hello. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6242.0s)]
*  But yeah, as far as the 90s thing, which you asked is so I did two shitty movies for three [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6243.0s)]
*  million dollars each. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6246.0s)]
*  They were terrible. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6247.0s)]
*  I shouldn't have done them. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6248.0s)]
*  I just didn't know what I was doing. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6249.0s)]
*  I came off with too much heat. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6251.0s)]
*  I had Wayne's World, Perot, Bush, Carson. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6253.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6255.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6256.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6257.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6258.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6259.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6260.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6261.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6263.0s)]
*  I was doing. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6264.0s)]
*  All this stuff came together. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6265.0s)]
*  So I had too much heat and I didn't really know what to do as a middle class kid because [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6266.0s)]
*  now I wasn't 30. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6268.5s)]
*  I was three million. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6269.5s)]
*  And I hated it so much. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6271.04s)]
*  I said then I had two other offers, pay or play Hansen Frans, the girly man dilemma. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6272.04s)]
*  But we wrote it with Arnold. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6277.04s)]
*  He dropped out. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6278.2s)]
*  So I didn't want to do that. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6279.32s)]
*  Bob Odukirk and I wrote a Western called Tucson for me and John Lovitz. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6280.6s)]
*  That John with that fell out. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6285.48s)]
*  And so I and that was three million pair of play. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6287.24s)]
*  But I was OK to get rid of that. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6289.32s)]
*  They've tried to put us together and bad boys. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6290.64s)]
*  Another three million pair of play. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6293.6s)]
*  But then the script just wasn't right. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6295.02s)]
*  And it was a hot oven at that point for me. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6296.68s)]
*  So I got out of that. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6299.4400000000005s)]
*  So then I just sort of stopped. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6301.64s)]
*  And then I had two kids. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6303.58s)]
*  But it wasn't it. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6304.96s)]
*  Then they went along and then I did the variety show. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6306.92s)]
*  I did a special and then I did the variety show with, you know, with Lucy Kay and, you [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6309.4400000000005s)]
*  know, because they're great writers on that great show. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6314.96s)]
*  It was writers. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6317.68s)]
*  Smigel was it was you know, I interviewed Lucy Kay. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6319.64s)]
*  You know, he was brilliant then. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6323.200000000001s)]
*  And we had we had an A-team for sure. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6325.04s)]
*  When you decided to like take it. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6327.8s)]
*  Was it a decision to take a break or was just like this kind of feels what I should do? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6329.320000000001s)]
*  Was it like specifically to kind of be a parent? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6332.660000000001s)]
*  Was it to make sure that like there was there was some of that we moved up to California. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6334.84s)]
*  I was also sort of disillusioned, you know, because the movie thing, once you make those [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6339.92s)]
*  two things and they stick to you, then you're just in a hole to dig out of in a way. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6344.54s)]
*  When I've done I had Hans and Franz, the girly man dilemma and others that I was working [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6349.48s)]
*  on, I just made just a misstep. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6354.84s)]
*  I always think of big life, big mistakes. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6356.72s)]
*  It's OK to have regrets. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6358.36s)]
*  But then at that point, I could make a fortune in stand up. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6360.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6363.28s)]
*  So I could work. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6364.28s)]
*  I would take two months off at Christmas. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6365.28s)]
*  I would take the summers off. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6366.84s)]
*  So I could be a present dad and make a shit ton of money, especially corporate dates. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6367.84s)]
*  I didn't want to do them. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6373.5599999999995s)]
*  So they'd say this much. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6375.36s)]
*  I'd say, no, I don't want to do it. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6376.36s)]
*  And they go, how about this much? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6378.0s)]
*  No, I don't want to do it. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6379.2s)]
*  Then they say this much. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6380.2s)]
*  I go, and a private jet? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6381.2s)]
*  I said, I want to do it. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6382.8s)]
*  OK, what kind of private jet? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6384.4400000000005s)]
*  Gulfstream. OK, so then I started doing those interstitially. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6386.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. So I was able to take care of everybody financially. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6390.2s)]
*  But I was in no man's land. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6392.96s)]
*  I was untethered. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6395.360000000001s)]
*  But, you know, fame was not something that I was I'm kind of like other there's that [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6396.68s)]
*  there's some of us where fame didn't quite settle with us. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6402.84s)]
*  It's scary. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6407.08s)]
*  Some people embrace it and love it. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6407.84s)]
*  And I don't judge that at all or very easy with it. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6409.12s)]
*  For me, I'm kind of an introverted extrovert. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6412.12s)]
*  So being famous was not it was a very odd thing. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6414.0s)]
*  The money was fun and the creativity is fun. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6418.32s)]
*  But the fame part, you know, I don't know. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6420.28s)]
*  It's kind of scary. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6422.32s)]
*  But that's how I navigated that. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6423.32s)]
*  I just throw those numbers out so people know because my wife. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6424.56s)]
*  So I was doing Stand Up While Back and I would just tease the crowd. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6427.360000000001s)]
*  We go, I know you're thinking, like, why am I here? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6430.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like 20 seats in the valley. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6432.6s)]
*  And I go, I know me, too, but I'm a millionaire and stuff like that. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6434.76s)]
*  So you don't want people to go, oh, he was so big and now he's poor. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6437.92s)]
*  So it was never a problem. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6441.84s)]
*  And now it's just full circle. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6443.64s)]
*  Everything's real in real time for me. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6445.92s)]
*  And so this this weird place thing is just super fun. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6448.200000000001s)]
*  Fly on the wall with David is super fun. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6451.92s)]
*  I mean, so I'm just having complete creative fun with both those things. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6454.52s)]
*  I'm not frustrated. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6457.64s)]
*  Not in a shitty movie or stupid TV show. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6459.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm doing my own thing now. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6461.52s)]
*  You know, what was it like watching your kids be funny? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=6464.240000000001s)]

*  We got just in a frenzy because we just, we were trying to stop it. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7167.160000000001s)]
*  If you got a loose handed dookie of a stranger, I don't know if [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7170.64s)]
*  there's any other, I mean, you should have a person. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7173.4s)]
*  Well, we had every texture that day. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7175.5599999999995s)]
*  We had kind of milky, we had really solids. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7176.92s)]
*  We had two double solids. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7179.4s)]
*  We had, we had every kind of feces going out that thing. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7180.639999999999s)]
*  We learned a lot about the human anatomy and gastrointestinal stuff. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7183.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7186.639999999999s)]
*  But these are all true stories. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7187.04s)]
*  I couldn't even tell you. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7188.32s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7189.32s)]
*  It's good. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7190.92s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7191.36s)]
*  These, we had some rough and tumble. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7191.92s)]
*  You know, what I remember about, a lot of people don't remember, like I'll hang [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7194.4s)]
*  out with my best friends from growing up and they don't remember a lot of the [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7197.36s)]
*  stuff that happened. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7200.04s)]
*  That's the interesting thing. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7200.839999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, you're kind of jogging my memory because of the car and all these [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7201.88s)]
*  things, you know, don't remember it. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7206.08s)]
*  I don't know if they didn't, weren't paying us enough attention or I think I [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7207.56s)]
*  was hyper aware as a kid too. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7211.24s)]
*  I think as comedians, you get hyper aware because you're really alert and sensitive [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7212.72s)]
*  to what's going on. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7216.88s)]
*  That's good for a comedian is to be observant and really be a sensitive [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7217.8s)]
*  instrument, I call it. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7221.68s)]
*  And so it's almost a form of light form of Asperger's. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7223.12s)]
*  You don't want to look at the light too much because everything's so intense, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7225.88s)]
*  you know, and, uh, I just remembered all of it. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7228.8s)]
*  You know, I just said, because it was, and there were some just lazy moments too, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7231.88s)]
*  but there was one time where I just got incredibly lucky and it was almost a [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7236.12s)]
*  spooky day at this cab, weird cabin in Montana. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7239.52s)]
*  Well, they had a slot machine in there, you know, it had all dimes in it. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7242.8s)]
*  And so I started getting, you were a child or an adult? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7246.32s)]
*  I was a child. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7248.2s)]
*  I was like eight, Scott was 10. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7248.96s)]
*  I started hitting jackpots. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7250.6s)]
*  No. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7251.88s)]
*  And it's like, and then he'd do it and I kept hitting jackpots. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7252.360000000001s)]
*  Then we were playing poker and we had these chips and I kept getting perfect [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7254.76s)]
*  hands. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7257.68s)]
*  It was this day where I was just incredibly lucky for this day. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7258.04s)]
*  Like I couldn't lose, couldn't lose. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7261.92s)]
*  It went back to the little, and it was dimes coming out. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7264.12s)]
*  He gets like, you know, one cherry gets a dime, like three cherries. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7266.56s)]
*  So that was kind of a mystical day, you know? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7270.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7273.76s)]
*  Things when you're young, they have so much, like even if you win, you win [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7274.0s)]
*  seven dimes, it's like, remember when this happened or the armor, we were [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7276.8s)]
*  going to the movies and we found a busted open Coke machine and somebody had been [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7280.76s)]
*  trying to rob it and like Jimmy it open and they'd ran off obviously right as [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7283.88s)]
*  money was falling out and I walked up and there was all this money and a watch. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7286.96s)]
*  You could see the robber that had reached in there where his watch had come off. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7291.64s)]
*  So suddenly it had me a nice watch and as much money as you could think of. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7295.52s)]
*  I loved it. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7299.0s)]
*  That was my addiction to shoplifting. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7299.64s)]
*  You know, I would go in when I finally got caught, like I had a special billowy [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7301.76s)]
*  coat and a special secret pocket in the back. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7306.4s)]
*  And so I was like in this drug store and I was been shoplifting like crazy, you [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7309.96s)]
*  know, shopping candy, everything. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7315.0s)]
*  And I got this top that you would spin and I put it in there and I'm on my bike [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7316.28s)]
*  and right as I was getting away, the guy grabbed the back of it. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7320.28s)]
*  So then my brothers, you know, they are the ones who got me into shoplifting. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7323.36s)]
*  They would stick stuff down my, they would stick stuff down my pants. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7326.36s)]
*  But then I, you know, that I was shamed by that. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7330.2s)]
*  I, they, I took the fall. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7332.719999999999s)]
*  They didn't say we were shoplifting too. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7334.28s)]
*  And we used to stick stuff down his pants. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7335.8s)]
*  We taught them how to do it. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7337.32s)]
*  They didn't say anything. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7338.44s)]
*  They stayed quiet. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7339.36s)]
*  So my dad came in and I thought, okay, here it comes, you know, snap the belt. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7340.36s)]
*  Then he goes, Oh, Jesus Christ, you brought shame to the family. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7344.64s)]
*  Oh, but I didn't really feel that. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7348.4800000000005s)]
*  I saw bullshit. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7350.64s)]
*  I thought, come on, they were all shoplifting. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7353.0s)]
*  Well, anyway, we're halfway through the podcast. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7356.04s)]
*  We're going to take a break and I'm sorry. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7358.0s)]
*  We've probably done pretty good. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7359.92s)]
*  How long have we been? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7360.96s)]

*  Then he goes to the globe and he sees an ant and he puts an ant on the globe and [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7498.76s)]
*  it's magic globe. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7502.68s)]

*  They did effects. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7562.2s)]
*  I did some practical effects where we, we, we layered in, layered in ton of [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7563.320000000001s)]

*  I want to know a little bit more. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7571.6s)]

*  They were partners. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7573.72s)]
*  Lendon and McCartney. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7574.76s)]
*  We kind of lay down some initial effects with our just voices and whatnot or [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7575.68s)]
*  find some stuff on YouTube. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7580.4400000000005s)]

*  That's why I kept doing it. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7598.4800000000005s)]
*  And those guys went downtown with that ant thing and we kept doing it. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7599.56s)]
*  Did the Carvies gang up on you any, Julian? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7603.8s)]

*  That's genetic. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7612.64s)]
*  Not much, but no, we all grew up together. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7613.76s)]
*  We had a whole cut cutting our back fence and we had a tin can phone and whatnot. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7616.0s)]
*  So we go way back. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7620.360000000001s)]
*  They were, they know each other. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7621.76s)]

*  I mean, they're like thick as thieves and they have so much shared experience. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7625.16s)]
*  I met Julian when he was three. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7628.92s)]
*  God. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7630.92s)]
*  What was he like then? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7631.4400000000005s)]
*  He was, he was about, uh, he was pretty, pretty cocky. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7633.16s)]
*  Really? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7637.04s)]
*  He had diapers on, but he had it. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7637.719999999999s)]
*  And no, he was just a cute little kid. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7639.2s)]
*  It was probably on probably just strolling around the neighborhood. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7640.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7644.84s)]
*  Drinking out of a tip. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7645.16s)]
*  That's cocky as you can get dude. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7646.24s)]
*  And his dad's from Mississippi. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7648.0s)]
*  So that was, you know, I was, I was baptized in Mississippi. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7649.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh damn. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7652.44s)]
*  Maybe that's what's up. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7653.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7654.36s)]
*  Dude. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7655.36s)]
*  I saw, I used to work over there and, uh, I had to paint a fence one time, right? [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7655.599999999999s)]
*  With this fella, big Johnny and he was homoerotic guy, right? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7661.48s)]
*  And they didn't, you know, and he would wear a big chains and stuff. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7664.36s)]
*  And he had a big Afro and he would drive on a riding lawnmower all the time. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7668.48s)]
*  And he and I had to paint this white fence and the birds, all these, uh, I think [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7673.0s)]
*  there were nightingales maybe would come and try to get into his hair. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7679.24s)]
*  And so my job while I was painting, I had a badminton racket and just [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7684.0s)]
*  to whack them all day, bro. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7687.759999999999s)]
*  So that was your job? [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7689.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7690.719999999999s)]
*  We were out there. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7690.96s)]
*  I started painting, but by the baby, about an hour and he couldn't [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7691.36s)]
*  handle the pressure of the nature. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7693.88s)]
*  So what's 60 cents an hour and you're just whacking birds with a 10. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7695.68s)]
*  Oh, I was doing pretty, I'll get paid five bucks an hour, but I was out there. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7698.76s)]
*  I probably, dude, I bet I took 30 sparrows off that dude's brim that day, man. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7701.16s)]
*  I mean, cause they, his hair was just, they wanted a nest in it. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7705.72s)]
*  But did you wound them and then they'd fly away or did you really whack them dead? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7708.96s)]
*  I'd say probably 40, 40, 50 or 40, not 40, 50, 50, 50. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7712.56s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7717.84s)]
*  Birds are intense. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7719.32s)]
*  Yeah, it depends. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7720.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, well, the problem with birds is they're coming out of the sky and you [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7721.5599999999995s)]
*  don't know what's going on up there. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7723.719999999999s)]
*  That's what I find. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7724.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7725.84s)]
*  We have animals you get a little bit more. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7726.36s)]
*  You get the, they run up, you get the ambiance about a bird. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7727.92s)]
*  You're like, fuck, you know, we have some koi fish on our farm slash ranch and [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7730.719999999999s)]
*  they're inside this cement. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7734.5599999999995s)]
*  It came with the house, but they built it. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7736.5199999999995s)]
*  So like the bald eagles or whatever's up there, cause most of the people come over [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7738.759999999999s)]
*  and go, I can't believe they're still alive and they're big. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7742.44s)]
*  They're like 40 pounds and they'll live to like 110. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7744.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7747.32s)]
*  They'll live way past us. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7747.84s)]
*  They're like vegetables that float around. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7749.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, they go around in circle on a five foot thing and they're [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7751.44s)]
*  fascinated for a hundred years. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7753.8s)]
*  But anyway, he said that the birds intuitively know they could get them [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7755.719999999999s)]
*  with their tailons, is that it? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7759.08s)]
*  But they wouldn't, they don't have enough runway to get out cause they'd [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7760.76s)]
*  hit the Buddha statue. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7763.92s)]
*  Damn. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7765.4s)]
*  So they're safe for now. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7766.08s)]
*  They're safe for now. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7768.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7769.12s)]
*  Safe for now. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7769.48s)]
*  I think we all, we're all, that's all we all are. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7770.32s)]
*  We're all safe. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7772.12s)]
*  How do we close this deal? [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7772.84s)]
*  I, I, this has been so much fun. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7775.0s)]

*  And so I think that's super to me. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7790.4s)]
*  That's really cool, man. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7791.92s)]
*  Like, you know, I talk about doing stuff with my brother. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7793.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people who'd give anything to be able to do a job with [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7795.32s)]
*  their dad, no matter what it is, you know, and like, um, especially to make [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7798.36s)]
*  something like this, that almost anybody could really make, like, of course, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7801.92s)]
*  people aren't gonna have the same talents. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7805.44s)]
*  People make them, but we know that you got it. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7806.72s)]
*  There's a whole new level you need to go to. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7809.84s)]
*  You can't just write a script, get some voice actors and add a couple of effects. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7811.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7815.280000000001s)]
*  You need to win the war every moment for the attention span. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7815.64s)]
*  You need every single moment. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7819.16s)]
*  That's why we made it kind of like an album, you know, rather than just [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7821.04s)]
*  something to get something else. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7825.8s)]
*  Hey, maybe someone will buy it and we'll make a lot of money. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7827.6s)]
*  You know, we actually said, no, we want to conquer this space. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7830.12s)]
*  And those guys who they were writing with me at the table, they [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7833.68s)]
*  were directing me, um, they were doing rewrites and they were doing the editing [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7836.52s)]
*  and they were stacking the effects and working with Ben and, you know, it's [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7840.72s)]
*  just, and choosing music, bringing in the music and the music inspired me. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7844.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7848.8s)]
*  You know, and the right scary music for psycho bill or what's the music. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7849.200000000001s)]
*  And we had the, that library. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7853.0s)]
*  So we were able to make it filmic as you can see by these samples. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7854.320000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7858.080000000001s)]
*  Well, it's also does that thing for me. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7858.400000000001s)]
*  It brings back your imagination. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7860.040000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7861.88s)]
*  Suddenly my imagination has to work and it's almost excited. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7862.4800000000005s)]
*  And I don't mean that any dad and son could do this or any dad and family [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7866.44s)]
*  and friends can do this or any group. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7869.88s)]
*  Anybody could, you could make something fun with your family. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7871.88s)]
*  You could do something with the tools available. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7874.12s)]
*  You can make cool stuff. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7876.24s)]
*  You can make really cool stuff. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7877.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7878.48s)]
*  But also obviously you guys are trying to get it at a level out there where it's [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7878.8s)]
*  like, you know, you want to put a piece of art out into the world. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7881.76s)]
*  And I think it's interesting that you didn't burn yourself out over the years. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7884.28s)]
*  So you still have the ver a little bit of the veracity or concerned or to want [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7887.88s)]
*  to do something like this. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7894.12s)]
*  A lot of people get burnt. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7895.24s)]
*  I mean, people that, you know, do 20 things that they don't want to do for [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7896.4s)]
*  years and they get burnt out, you know? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7900.6s)]
*  So my other son watched the time machine with Rod Taylor, obsessed, which I showed [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7902.36s)]
*  him as a little kid and he's possessed by it. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7905.68s)]
*  So art and music, my family with the Beatles and movies, just everything to us, [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7908.36s)]
*  making art, uh, doing it. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7914.12s)]
*  I like to think that because of my cross country and track, I've kept my VO two [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7916.4800000000005s)]
*  max really strong, like I don't think anyone in Hollywood could hike up. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7920.08s)]
*  A hill with me. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7924.84s)]
*  I don't really think so if they could, but I'm going past like they're all in the [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7925.599999999999s)]
*  slow lane. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7929.799999999999s)]
*  So you could beat Neil and easy on his little, well, yeah, I don't want to pick [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7930.36s)]
*  on him. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7933.44s)]

*  I mean, it sounds so self congratulatory, but I cared just as much about this as [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7958.72s)]
*  anything I've done. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7963.68s)]
*  Anything doesn't matter to me when something was kind of shitty, if [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7965.08s)]
*  something's popular, okay, I might like it, but well, you can tell by hearing, [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7968.96s)]
*  right? [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7974.12s)]
*  You just tell it. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7974.4s)]
*  Cause that it's the amount of layering that went into it and the amount of sound [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7975.04s)]
*  collage and just finding cycle bill and writing the part and what do they say? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=7978.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8014.16s)]
*  He uses it or weapon, but he doesn't even talk about it. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8014.4s)]
*  It's just, you don't really know that. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8016.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8018.44s)]
*  And he has the biggest, thickest, darkest mustache you've ever fucking seen. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8018.88s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8022.719999999999s)]

*  That's your cycle bill. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8026.679999999999s)]
*  So that you, and you can get out of the prison easy. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8028.12s)]
*  He could literally just walk through the bars if you want. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8030.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's stuff that happens, but he stays in there because it's just, [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8032.679999999999s)]
*  it's well, he's things happen in the storyline. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8035.96s)]
*  There's stuff that happens with other sailors and there's some [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8038.92s)]
*  illicit stuff that's going on. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8042.6s)]
*  So, you know, that's the great thing about this. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8044.84s)]
*  If you're driving around as a mom with your kids and it's nothing else, [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8047.76s)]
*  you can listen to it with family. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8051.04s)]
*  And let them imagine the story. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8052.2s)]
*  Let them decide what Captain McKinley looks like or Captain Jack, you know, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8054.84s)]
*  who I worked after my wife's Irish uncle. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8059.360000000001s)]
*  I'm I don't talk like that. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8062.88s)]
*  And we just call him Captain Jack. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8063.88s)]
*  So all the characters have some, some reason or some way I found my way to them. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8064.92s)]
*  There's a character called Smarty Wiggins, a pirate. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8070.64s)]
*  And I based it off this Irish woman, Noni, who talks sort of like this, [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8072.84s)]
*  but he's the smartest pirate in the world. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8077.4800000000005s)]
*  And he invents the toilet and he goes, I call it a lavatory. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8080.52s)]
*  Because he's a genius pirate. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8085.68s)]
*  But that was coming from Noni's voice. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8087.4800000000005s)]
*  God rest her soul. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8089.68s)]
*  She went to the stars. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8090.52s)]
*  God damn. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8091.88s)]
*  That's what my father used to say all the time. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8093.0s)]
*  God damn. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8095.4400000000005s)]
*  God damn. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8096.08s)]
*  And he would like just randomly. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8098.6s)]
*  Yeah, we'd wake him up and he'd be like, God damn it. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8101.56s)]
*  It was like all I remember saying most of my life, dude. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8105.52s)]
*  And then he would like have some beers. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8109.24s)]
*  He would, oh, he would take me to the bar with him and he'd tell me to go walk down [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8111.12s)]
*  the bar and come back, you know. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8114.72s)]
*  Well, my dad used to literally walk down the bar and I'd walk down with all the [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8116.88s)]
*  people's glasses on and stuff and walk down and get a beer for him or just walk [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8120.32s)]
*  down it and come back. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8124.88s)]
*  You know, when you're little, it's a long bar. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8125.84s)]
*  You know, when you're four or five, it's a pretty long bar. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8127.52s)]
*  But it's all nasty stuff. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8129.32s)]
*  A bar is illicit. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8130.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8132.16s)]
*  You know, reaching in and getting a little popcorn or a snack. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8132.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8135.36s)]
*  You know, jumping over this glass and you know, having to conversate with people. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8135.92s)]
*  It's almost maybe that's how I got on stage first. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8140.4400000000005s)]
*  I didn't even think about that. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8142.08s)]
*  Well, God yeah. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8143.2s)]
*  So I'd go walk the bar for him down there and the lady would be down there. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8144.2s)]
*  She'd give me a little Christmas candy. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8147.2s)]
*  Even if it was out of season, she'd have a little cup of Christmas candy. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8148.96s)]
*  And he just wanted you to walk down just to see what it was like. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8151.52s)]
*  Get off his nerves for about 30. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8153.72s)]
*  So just go walk around for a bit. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8155.16s)]
*  Yeah, go walk down the bar. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8156.68s)]
*  He'd say, because it's hard to get down the bar. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8157.84s)]
*  If you walk down the floor, it's wide open, but the bar, there's deviance. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8159.400000000001s)]
*  You got a damn fucking pedophile. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8162.88s)]
*  You got a couple fists fighting there. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8164.52s)]
*  You know, you got a guy picking his nails, you know, and giving it to you or whatever. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8166.96s)]
*  You know, you got a lot of. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8171.400000000001s)]
*  And you have a great memory. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8172.52s)]
*  You got people to meet along the way. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8173.92s)]
*  You paint pictures with your brain because I'm imagining this bar now. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8175.240000000001s)]
*  And imagine 10 year old Theo. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8179.8s)]
*  Tony Padone's it was called. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8181.6s)]
*  Tony, but then my dad was like, we're going to ride. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8183.44s)]
*  We're going to all right. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8185.36s)]
*  We're going to head home. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8185.759999999999s)]
*  And he would sit in the car like we're going to leave in just a minute. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8186.48s)]
*  And then he fucking fall asleep. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8188.719999999999s)]
*  And I'd just be fucking sitting there and waiting for him to wake up. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8190.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, my dad would when I was in junior, I was the last kid there. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8194.279999999999s)]
*  He'd give me an enema kit because he was too embarrassed to go buy one. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8197.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, oh, Jesus Christ, Dane. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8200.72s)]
*  This is this is my best. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8203.119999999999s)]
*  This is how we talk. Oh, could you give me one of these? [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8204.16s)]
*  And it's something funny because I was buying the enema kit for him. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8206.76s)]
*  No embarrassment. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8210.16s)]
*  Yeah. Even though they might be go, what? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8211.4s)]
*  You you you're that constipated. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8213.52s)]
*  You're 18. You weigh 110 pounds. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8215.199999999999s)]
*  Jesus, kid. But I know. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8217.119999999999s)]
*  OK, just give me the enema kit. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8219.039999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8220.76s)]
*  But he did take us to the Kit Kat Club in Idaho Falls. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8222.24s)]
*  And it was illicit. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8226.8s)]
*  It was dark and kind of nasty. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8228.039999999999s)]
*  Your father took in there. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8230.24s)]
*  He took us in there to get you a drink. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8231.32s)]
*  No, we were just driving up to Montana. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8233.68s)]
*  My sister went with my mother on a plane. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8235.8s)]
*  And so we drove up. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8239.6s)]
*  But just the bar seen as a young the darkness of it. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8240.6s)]
*  Because when I worked at Holiday Inn as a busboy and I'd go to or a waiter, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8244.24s)]
*  I'd go into the bar to get drinks in the afternoon. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8247.68s)]
*  And then there'd be like a parent of one of my friends would be in there [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8250.880000000001s)]
*  just getting blasted. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8254.52s)]
*  He'd see me and he kind of looked down. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8255.52s)]
*  And then I did room service. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8258.16s)]
*  I waited on Michael Jackson. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8259.48s)]
*  I waited on Little Richard. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8260.84s)]
*  He was naked. I waited on Richard was. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8262.12s)]
*  And did he answer the door naked? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8264.24s)]
*  And we saw more. Well, there was a man in the bed with sheets over. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8265.800000000001s)]
*  And he answered the door naked. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8268.6s)]
*  Seems pretty gay, I think. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8269.96s)]
*  I think it's gay. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8271.119999999999s)]
*  And he goes, have you been to the show? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8272.0s)]
*  Because he was playing the circle star. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8273.439999999999s)]
*  You were a child. I was 18, 19. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8274.6s)]
*  You've been to the show. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8277.199999999999s)]
*  And I did. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8277.88s)]
*  Yeah, I just I waited on Richard Pryor, waited on, you know, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8278.56s)]
*  Carlin, waited on Rich Little, stuff like that. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8283.84s)]
*  Those are whole other stories. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8287.039999999999s)]
*  But yeah. But anyway, so Theo, I think we're OK, man. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8288.279999999999s)]

*  We spent a lot of time together, man. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8294.039999999999s)]
*  Well, it just flowed really nice because I do this now. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8295.92s)]
*  So I know you did this for a job. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8299.08s)]
*  This was really fun and easy. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8301.0s)]
*  I enjoyed it a lot. Yeah, me too, man. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8302.8s)]

*  I kind of broke a sweat a little bit, but I think I'm OK. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8305.679999999998s)]
*  I think it counts as a workout. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8308.96s)]
*  Well, just you get it. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8310.8s)]

*  because your stuff just keep it was inspiring me. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8317.759999999998s)]
*  Because I'm like in a new car, the brother or the thing, the guy with one toe [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8320.119999999999s)]

*  We had some kind of like that, too. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8325.8s)]
*  Yeah, we were we were kind of hillbillies from the middle class [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8327.92s)]
*  white suburbs, basically up there in the Bay San Francisco Bay Area. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8332.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it's interesting. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8335.88s)]
*  I think there's just so many commonalities. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8337.599999999999s)]
*  But I love remembering things from the past. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8339.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's pretty fascinating. I love imagination. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8341.8s)]
*  And yeah, I think stuff like this is good. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8344.48s)]
*  Stuff like the weird place is great for people because, yeah, it'll help [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8346.16s)]
*  just to get you to go, especially moms knowing her dad's knowing [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8350.8s)]
*  that they could listen to with their kids. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8353.4s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, what do your kids think? Throw it on. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8354.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And then we have some emotionality, like I said, in it. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8356.800000000001s)]
*  Nothing heavy handed, but there's some sweetness to it and earnestness to it. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8360.880000000001s)]
*  And we were doing thinking of this before Ted Lasso, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8365.28s)]
*  which I think that struck a nerve to. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8368.720000000001s)]
*  We love the dark stuff and you know, but there's something about earnestness [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8370.6s)]
*  and sincerity. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8375.36s)]
*  And we loved going back into that 60s vibe. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8376.640000000001s)]
*  And they're all evergreen. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8379.880000000001s)]
*  They could play a thousand years from now. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8381.28s)]
*  If there'll still be submarines. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8383.0s)]
*  And so we just love it and just feel very lucky. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8384.8s)]
*  Was there ever a chance like looking back on some of your like prime days [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8389.4s)]
*  when you were working on SNL and you got to work with so many unique people [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8392.08s)]
*  and at a time when they let characters really develop? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8396.08s)]
*  Yeah. And reoccurred. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8398.64s)]
*  You had your catchphrase. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8399.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was so it was so much fun. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8401.8s)]
*  Was there ever a chance you guys would try to get back to? [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8405.04s)]
*  I've always wondered why didn't like five or six of the guys [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8407.16s)]
*  say, hey, let's do this again. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8409.76s)]
*  Let's just make our own thing and do it. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8413.08s)]
*  It's you know, it you step outside of perspective, you know. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8415.72s)]
*  No, I know. And you always think, oh, but then you're kind of like, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8419.2s)]
*  how do you get back to sketch? [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8422.72s)]
*  You know, me doing these voices and improvising these rhythms [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8424.16s)]
*  was exercising that same idea. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8428.44s)]
*  And there's a freedom without an audience. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8431.32s)]
*  You know, you don't want to be indulgent, but you can also step outside yourself. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8433.32s)]
*  But yeah, it's a magic thing. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8437.039999999999s)]
*  That's why Spade and I podcast is popular. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8439.48s)]
*  It's a reality show. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8441.84s)]
*  The people will laugh and we'll have a good time. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8442.759999999998s)]
*  But there's an emotional underpinning to that shared story [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8445.519999999999s)]
*  of getting this incredible lucky break. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8450.32s)]
*  You're with your friends or I call them your bandmates. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8452.64s)]
*  You're all getting a little money. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8455.0s)]
*  You're getting a little famous and you're all doing it together. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8456.92s)]
*  And you're live in Rockefeller Center way up in the sky [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8459.279999999999s)]
*  in the middle of the night. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8462.96s)]
*  And there's horses and dwarfs on the show and people are juggling [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8464.480000000001s)]
*  and you're falling down and all kinds of shit going on. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8468.720000000001s)]
*  And so it's something that's it's a fever dream kind of in a way. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8471.720000000001s)]
*  But getting back to it is very tough. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8476.08s)]
*  There's other ways to do it. You know, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8479.28s)]
*  I think I had a podcast a while back where I was doing long form riffs. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8482.480000000001s)]
*  It was called Fantastic. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8485.84s)]
*  It's still out there where I would just take flight of fancies [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8487.0s)]
*  and go for 10 minutes because that's what I would do backstage. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8489.880000000001s)]
*  Kevin and I would do Hans and Franz for like an hour. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8492.64s)]
*  Yeah, you'll lose it. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8495.56s)]
*  We would just cock in that voice for an hour. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8497.119999999999s)]
*  You found good moments. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8499.08s)]
*  Yeah. And then we'd have to repeat it on. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8499.88s)]
*  But our best moments, we would just fall and giggling and, you know, just by, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8501.68s)]
*  you know, the moment that you can't that moment. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8506.08s)]
*  It's so nice when Kevin said, and if you don't think we're properly pumped up, [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8508.4s)]
*  then you know, the defensiveness of Hans and Franz, we could very easily [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8511.439999999999s)]
*  come to your house, stretch the flap of your back into the shape of a rope [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8515.039999999999s)]
*  ladder so you could crawl down into the sewer. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8519.119999999999s)]
*  Because that's where losers live. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8522.119999999999s)]
*  To me, it's poetry. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8523.96s)]
*  It may be my favorite rhythms and the guys who never lived anything. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8525.039999999999s)]
*  They're terribly wounded, terribly insecure. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8528.8s)]
*  They have this stupid show and they're just trying to get back at imaginary enemies. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8531.88s)]
*  They think the audience doesn't think they're macho. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8536.32s)]
*  And I could very easily. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8538.92s)]
*  You're lucky your buttocks are like marshmallows. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8540.32s)]
*  You're lucky I don't have a campfire here. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8543.039999999999s)]
*  Don't undo your belt. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8545.56s)]

*  You put tell your muscles are so flabby. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8549.119999999999s)]
*  I like to shape them in a bowl and put them under the put you on the Christmas tree. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8551.08s)]
*  You know, it just gets into madness. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8555.16s)]
*  So Kevin and I love that. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di1YURPoJ8&t=8556.48s)]
