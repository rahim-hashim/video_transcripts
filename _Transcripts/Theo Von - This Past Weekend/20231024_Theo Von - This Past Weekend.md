*  So now those bags, you know, they're heavy and I get it everybody would say well, we don't know we're not garbage, right? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1335.6s)]
*  Well now you're gonna know [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1341.28s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I remember when I used to go over to rich people's houses my buddy Jeff would steal so he had a whole collection [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1347.92s)]
*  Of silverware and we were poor poor. So it was like everybody was rich [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1353.4s)]
*  You know I'm saying we knew people if you had a fucking front door, bro. You had a little bit of money, you know, so like [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1358.16s)]
*  Jeff has silverware from everybody dude [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1365.2s)]
*  And then if I went over to rich people's houses a lot of times I would pick my nose when they weren't looking and feed [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1367.56s)]
*  a fucking booger to that dog [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1372.56s)]
*  What was the thought process of getting out of that I think for me it was something like [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1377.8799999999999s)]
*  Start from the bottom like you convinced these animals to fucking work for you low-key, you know I'm saying it was like I'm gonna [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1384.56s)]
*  They may think they're doing all this and all of that, but who's fucking feeding these animals [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1391.52s)]
*  They just they just ate your booger. Yeah. Yeah, no, I get it [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1396.4s)]
*  I mean it was like I'm taking things to the lowest. It's like I'm just like I don't know [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1400.1200000000001s)]
*  It's probably some Lord of the Flies shit [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1403.8s)]
*  Yeah, so you got the big sausage bags in the city, right yeah and [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1408.8s)]
*  The city is just oh it's hell. It's multiplied crazy. Like there were times where you knew that [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1413.44s)]
*  Like if their compactors were broke like it was awful man [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1420.96s)]
*  Really now they put out so they could probably fit [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1424.36s)]
*  I'd say a normal four or five bags of garbage in one of these sausage bags [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1427.28s)]
*  But now the compactor broke so now they got to put regular just bags out [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1431.0s)]
*  So it just went from 10 to 15 sausage bags to 150 regular garbage, but oh and it's one at a time [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  you know just chucking them over to cause and [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1440.24s)]
*  Like and now do you throw them to a buddy and he puts him in or that's the goal in the city [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1443.56s)]
*  You're pretty much just working together the whole time. Okay, when you go to St. Island, it's like half hour on half hour off [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1448.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so I'll drive for a half hour you load for a half hour [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1454.36s)]
*  Vice versa back and forth till the routes done. Okay, but in Manhattan [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1457.8s)]
*  It's like, you know all hands on deck because those bags are kind of heavy sometime. It reminds me a little like watching that show [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1461.76s)]
*  It's like an ocean show, you know I'm talking about it's like an ocean show and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1471.12s)]
*  they're angry and every year one of them dies and they put it on like TMZ, but [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1475.6799999999998s)]
*  they are looking for car first they're looking for a [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1480.76s)]
*  fish or something maybe I [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  Don't know. Yeah. Here's a video right here of some sanitation guys ready to throw in garbage bags into yep [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1487.6s)]
*  Oh, wow that dude, huh? I was awesome at that. Were you really? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  Bro that dude Wow [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1497.7199999999998s)]
*  That's a private guy that's buddy healed right there. Yep. That's a private guy. Oh, that's a private guy someone your boys [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1501.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so how can you tell that for a year the truck our trucks were white? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1507.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay, the white elephant that's what they call that and the white elephant always gotten people's way really pissed them off [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you guys are the worst dude. I used to do the whole Kogan real quick [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1517.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I used to do that. I just take my gloves off and they were bad, you know in Manhattan and I'd be like [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1520.3600000000001s)]
*  You're an asshole I'm like you should have woke up ten minutes early because now you're stuck behind me and I ain't moving [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1527.0s)]
*  About a sanitation truck is that not only you stuck but it smells bad [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  And they used to get real close and and like I was saying when the shit used to spray out [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  Especially rainy days after a rainy day or if it was raining wet days do that thing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1545.56s)]
*  And the cars would get covered [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  That's on you [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1555.0s)]
*  Dude so so that must have been kind of fun just throwing those bags [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1557.4s)]
*  That seemed like something a kid would love to do I storm behind my back just running down the street [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1560.76s)]
*  You know in Staten Island because it's a lot lighter and set up right right so that was in Staten Island [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1565.48s)]
*  But in the city, it's a little bit more you got to have you do there. You guys are loading this thing up [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1569.92s)]
*  You're just keeping it moving. Yeah [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1574.38s)]
*  and in the city how many bags can go or those big sausage bags can go into [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1576.1200000000001s)]
*  The cycle and what's the cycle like of the truck? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, we I mean you probably fit like five six of those bags in at a time [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1585.3600000000001s)]
*  but okay, your your average in Manhattan was 10 to [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1589.14s)]
*  1314 tons of garbage in per truck per trucks you start out with nothing in there empty. Okay [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1593.48s)]
*  And there's a compactor in the middle like in the in the truck, and then it just cycles and compacts it the whole time [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1599.44s)]
*  Okay, and the rule you got to get the route [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1606.72s)]
*  So you have to get the whole route on the truck so you would have to maneuver sometimes squeeze a little more squeeze a little [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1609.76s)]
*  More really and you hear it getting tight back in oh, yeah. Yeah [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1614.44s)]
*  Hey, you could feel it. It changes a whole drive of the truck really from being empty to heavy. Yeah [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1618.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know we spoke one time with a [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1624.52s)]
*  Female truck driver and she had worked with [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1627.36s)]
*  And her son I think had breast reduction surgery, but she had worked with a cement truck, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1630.92s)]
*  Yeah, and she said sometimes when the mixer was full [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1637.56s)]
*  She would drive and when she stopped some on the brakes [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1641.6399999999999s)]
*  You'd feel the cement come up the like that just the back of it was just really interesting [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1644.1399999999999s)]
*  So that kind of made me think of that. Oh [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1649.28s)]
*  It changes everything just you know, you think about it [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=1651.4s)]

*  Yeah, because there are some cans. I mean, I don't think back in the day they used to be metal cans [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2221.38s)]
*  They used to pick up ash in New York City [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2226.14s)]
*  So everybody would burn that garbage in the buildings and they would have these like [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2228.46s)]
*  150 pounds steel garbage cans and I had lifted a few of them in my time [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2233.58s)]

*  So the buildings would just burn their garbage [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2242.1s)]
*  All the housing buildings they used to just get rid of the garbage that way [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2245.26s)]
*  There was no bags on the street. So they'd incinerator in there. They would burn it up [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2248.34s)]

*  Four years and lo and behold all incinerators had stopped operations by the end of 1993 [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2317.34s)]
*  And that was the end of that no more trash burning [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2322.78s)]

*  No, then it was just ash. So they were just getting rid of it [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2351.46s)]
*  I don't know what they did with it back then but I mean after the trash man after they shut down the incinerators [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=2354.3s)]

*  Say 28 inch side on this side and a three foot side on the other side [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=4596.34s)]

*  You know any stove stuff like that you put on the other side on the metal on the yeah on the metal side [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=4605.82s)]

*  We used to open the sides of the truck [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=4622.9400000000005s)]
*  There's a door so you could get mechanics and stuff can get in there and work on the compactor and stuff [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=4624.9400000000005s)]

*  No, I didn't deal with that, but you've had to be involved with salting the roads or salt in the roads [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6018.54s)]
*  Front and loaders big like rubber tire machines used to have to fill the spreaders [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6024.0199999999995s)]

*  I would have to do dead ends with that [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6035.4400000000005s)]

*  No, on the bad storms when the snow is so bad when they would clean schools and dead ends and stuff like that [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6056.0s)]
*  You would have to go around with the front and loader [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6061.24s)]
*  I would have two dump trucks with me and I would load the dump trucks filled with snow [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6063.2s)]
*  Okay, so we're talking about snow. I thought you're talking about spreading salt [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6067.16s)]
*  Well, it's the same kind of thing but the spreaders couldn't fit down some of these blocks [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6069.64s)]
*  Okay [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6073.76s)]
*  So instead of getting the spreader they go and actually try and pick the snow up with a front and loader [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6074.28s)]
*  I would have we call them big rubber tire machines, you know [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=6078.08s)]

*  They were blocked in by cars where we had the chance to run [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7320.88s)]
*  We had to go back to my mother's house and wash the inside of the cabs out. Oh, that's how bad it was like hanging out [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7324.320000000001s)]
*  Oh crazy, man, but no, that's fun. Yeah, nobody's even paying attention to you. That's fucking fun, dude [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7330.2s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. And could you listen to music in the first in the our vehicle? There's no music in there [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7335.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, you would bring radios in on your own [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7340.92s)]
*  You would get like a radio or boombox or something like that [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7345.320000000001s)]
*  But you listen to what you want it to yeah country music was my thing, you know later in my role [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7349.12s)]
*  Yeah, and when I first started, you know, I was I used to get yelled at in one area because the music was too loud [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7354.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, cuz we would pump it listen. You got to make the best of you today [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7361.4s)]
*  Oh, I think so too music helps everything for sure. Yep [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7365.099999999999s)]
*  What's good and bad about the unions like about unions? What is that whole setup? Like can you talk about it? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7369.16s)]
*  If you don't feel that's okay, yeah, I mean it's it's you're in the Union, right? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7375.96s)]
*  Well, no because now the city pays me I'm not really in the Union anymore. Okay, I'm done [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7379.76s)]
*  It's not like I don't understand unions fully [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7384.16s)]
*  So maybe do you even have any explanation to me about what Union because you were part of a union, right? Yes [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7386.24s)]
*  I was okay. So how does that even have for some jobs? You have to be in a union to have the job [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7391.86s)]
*  Yeah, certain businesses run under union standards, okay, which means you have to have paid dues [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7397.44s)]
*  And you know whatever it is monthly you pay dues and and you stay in good standard within the Union now [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7403.36s)]
*  You know and then you get into like iron workers and all that those unions are totally different [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7410.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, because those unions are paying those guys pensions. Okay to me when I worked for New York [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7414.24s)]
*  Yes, we ran for a union like there's a different union for us the fire department the police department. Everybody has their own union [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7420.44s)]
*  But once I'm done, I'm out of that union and now the city just sends my checks [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7427.24s)]
*  Okay, like they I have nothing to do with the Union anymore. I don't go to meetings [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7431.64s)]
*  I don't you know picket line or I don't do all that nonsense no more. Did you guys ever have to strike? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7435.280000000001s)]
*  We couldn't we were signed under the Taylor law. Okay, so the Taylor you can't strike if you know you would you could lose [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7440.280000000001s)]
*  That's the one way you could lose your job [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7446.280000000001s)]
*  You couldn't it was crazy to do the job. You could never lose the job [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7448.360000000001s)]
*  I'm dead honest [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7453.6s)]
*  Literally, I knew guys that killed people that worked on their job. Yeah, they went to prison [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7455.76s)]
*  Their pensions are still waiting for them. Amen when they come out [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7460.740000000001s)]
*  But the thing is if you were dirty if you came up on drugs and stone on an accident and somebody got hurt [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7464.26s)]
*  That's probably the only way you can lose your job. I see [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7471.18s)]
*  So but the unions it's tough. It's listen. They're great [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7475.22s)]
*  It's just it's a it's expensive. Yeah, what type of injuries happen on the job to guys a lot? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7480.580000000001s)]

*  And then my back of course was just a matter of time [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7501.46s)]
*  Oh, you know once I stopped running around the streets picking garbage up and now I'm doing my side [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7504.46s)]
*  Well, not my side, but I was doing my kitchens and bathrooms at my speed not running four miles every day [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=7509.02s)]

*  I [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9434.82s)]
*  Wonder if it would be really different in different parts of america you think the job or do you think it would probably be the same? [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9436.9s)]
*  Across the board. No, I think it's definitely different because it's on a private, you know [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9442.26s)]
*  And where those guys that make I work for a private. I think I was making a hundred dollars a day [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9446.74s)]
*  Like just but I was I got it down to two three hours. So whatever I was making thirty-seven dollars an hour. Yeah, I care [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9452.42s)]
*  But those guys don't make the money like new york [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9458.74s)]
*  There's certain I think uh, like just around me like new york or elizabeth like where there are heavy unions [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9461.38s)]
*  They'll be unionized. But once you bring the privates in if they're picking up your uh, your garbage probably here and like in near my house [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9468.1s)]
*  They don't make that kind of money. Yeah, so it is it's a different animal [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9475.3s)]
*  And they don't even use guys like I said, they use the arm that lifts the whole thing up dumps it in the truck near my house [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9480.18s)]
*  Yeah [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9486.5s)]
*  So it's definitely different all over the country it's changing man. So even automation is killing that industry, huh? Yeah [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIltgwNnfQ&t=9487.46s)]
