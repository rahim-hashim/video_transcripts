*  because it, you know, a lot of humans as they get older they, you cross with an animal at a certain [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=163.04s)]
*  point. A lot of humans cross with an animal and for a lot of Asian, for a lot of Asian that's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=168.48s)]
*  catfish. You see that guy, you know, but yeah I've never been to a church before where I had seen [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=178.0s)]
*  Asians, multiple Asian doing, singing church hymns and it was pretty cool man, it just shows you that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=189.76s)]
*  that everybody can sing, you know, and that there's a, that everybody no matter what ethnicity or culture [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=200.96s)]
*  that they all can sing songs of faith and have, you know, and be excited and stuff like that and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=211.36s)]
*  be at church. I remember, I can't remember the song now but it was like, do you see the baby? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=218.24s)]
*  Do you see the baby? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  And they had a big screen in there and they'd have a picture of, you know, the three wise men going to get [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=234.08s)]
*  Jesus Christ out of the sand castle. So anyway what I'm trying to tell you is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=242.16s)]
*  happy Mother's Day. I want to say that out there to every type of mother, every [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=250.55999999999997s)]
*  every mother. There's a lot of you, there's a lot of you listening right now [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=257.84s)]
*  and you're a mother, you got something, you know, there's no other, that's how, I mean, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=265.2s)]
*  that's God's peephole baby. That's how God looks out into the world through a mother. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  That, I mean, you are the, you are the liaison between, you know, you're the on-ramp between the Lord [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=280.32s)]
*  and earth. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=292.72s)]
*  You got that on-ramp, you got that thoroughfire, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=296.0s)]
*  you know, you got that, you know, you got that yum tunnel on you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=303.68s)]
*  And that's how God, God, that's how God serves him. That's how he serves the world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=310.8s)]
*  You know, you're a woman's body, a woman's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  however they say it out there in some of these other continents, the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=325.76s)]
*  that's how the, you know, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=330.48s)]
*  that's how the Lord, you know, that's how he just puts people on earth. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=331.44s)]
*  That's God's last hand, that's his last, that's his, that's how he reaches out into the world [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=341.84s)]
*  through a woman, through a mother. That's really fascinating. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=347.68s)]
*  If I told you there was a portal, right, say I come up to you, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=352.48s)]
*  you're sitting somewhere, you're having a sandwich or something, you're having a little [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=359.04s)]
*  cut of meat, cut of cheese, you know, you're having a cut of meat, cut of cheese, two breads, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=362.8s)]
*  you know what it is, a sandwich. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=372.48s)]
*  Say you're having that, you're sitting on a little riverbank or something, I come up to you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=375.12s)]
*  I say, buddy, I'm going to tell you where there's a portal where you can go into another realm. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=380.8s)]
*  You'd be there in a heartbeat. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's what a mother, that's the only way, the only way [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=393.12s)]
*  to get from the brain of God, of the powers that be, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=400.24s)]
*  of Mother Nature and Mother Nature and Mother Nature and Mother Nature and Mother Nature and Mother [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=410.08s)]
*  God, of the powers that be, of Mother Nature and Father Time, the only portal is through a dang [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=414.8s)]
*  woman, a mother. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=430.24s)]
*  Or this bitch, as some people call her. I don't, you know, I don't say that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=434.32s)]
*  But anyway, I just want to, yeah, I want to wish everybody a happy Mother's Day, you know. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=440.24s)]
*  You know, sometimes I think that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  people are just ideas. They're like, like, what if God had an idea, right? And I say God in the, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  in the, you can, whatever God you want, it can be everybody. I have my, you can have your own God. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=457.92s)]
*  But I think of people sometimes as like an idea of God, like say you have an idea, right? An idea [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=467.36s)]
*  kind of comes in, it comes into you, like it comes out of kind of nowhere, right? Like if you have [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  an idea in your head, it comes out of nowhere. And some, some ideas there, they do, they, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=479.6s)]
*  they stick around, they, they turn into something. You know, some ideas, they make a difference. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=488.4s)]
*  They, some ideas really get turned into something and can adjust the world, can, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=496.96s)]
*  can change things, can adjust a fan, can adjust something small or as big as the whole world. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, ideas, they can, they can be, they can be, they can be, they can be, they can be, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=508.08s)]
*  they can, you don't know how big an idea can be or how far an idea can go, right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=516.48s)]
*  If we have an idea. So sometimes I think that humans, they're just ideas of God really, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=524.4s)]
*  you know? It's like we show up in the existence. We have a purpose sometimes. Sometimes we don't. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=531.76s)]
*  Sometimes we evaporate and disappear early, you know? Sometimes we stay around for a long time. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=540.64s)]
*  Sometimes we change our environment. And sometimes we, we, we, we can change the world, you know? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=548.88s)]
*  So I don't know if this is making sense, but I feel like life, it's like being a lot, it's like [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  being a lot, it's like we're almost like an idea of God. Like if we have an idea, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=565.04s)]
*  it comes into fruition, we do things with it. Some of them are really helpful. Some of them [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=571.12s)]
*  kind of come and go. But if God, when God has an idea, that's us, that's a person. We're his idea, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=575.68s)]
*  we're like ideas of God. We come into life, we meander. Sometimes we have an effect on things. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=582.64s)]
*  Sometimes we don't. And there we go. So not sure if that makes sense, but that's something that's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=590.4s)]
*  just been going on in my head. I'm grateful to be here with you today. I'm grateful to be thinking [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=602.48s)]
*  about mothers. I'm grateful to be thinking about mothers. I got to see my own mother last week in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  Phoenix, Arizona. She came out there and we had a nice time. You know, it's been a long journey [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=619.12s)]
*  with my own mother, getting to know her. And since we didn't have a connection when I was young, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=628.88s)]
*  getting to have a connection as adults. You know, I talk a lot about that. I'm not going to go into [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=636.08s)]
*  that right now, but it was awesome to get to see her. We got to do the largest show we'd ever done [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=644.0s)]
*  at the Arizona Financial Center. Dang, bro. Dang. Dude, warm up the Asians, baby, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=652.8s)]
*  because I'll sing about that. Oh, the baby is here. Oh, look at him. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=665.6s)]
*  That was magical. I want to thank everybody for coming out to that. It's a different type of energy, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=678.72s)]
*  man. You're out there on the stage and you feel little. God, I feel so little out there. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=682.88s)]
*  In a club, I feel normal size, regular size, six foot, 182. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=690.2399999999999s)]
*  One arm a little bit shorter than the other, neither arm [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=697.28s)]
*  that long, is neither long, medium arms. It's nothing you notice, but if you know, you know. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=704.56s)]
*  What was I talking about? Dang. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=713.6s)]
*  Oh, in that vast of a space, I feel like, I think I almost feel like a bird could come down and just [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=718.24s)]
*  pick me up off the stage. You know, it's almost like you feel like the mouse, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=725.36s)]
*  you know, somebody sees a mouse, they shine a light on it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=732.64s)]
*  And that's what it's like in there because it's big, it's dark. There's a light on you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, man, a big bird's going to come and damn get me. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=741.36s)]
*  God, I don't want that. I don't want some big dirty bird picking me up. But, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=747.6s)]
*  but that was incredible. Just to be honest, I don't know if you've ever seen a bird that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  big, but that was incredible. Just thank you guys for just being a part of my life for [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=762.88s)]
*  wanting to come and see me, wanting to let me see you. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=768.56s)]
*  You know, I'm just glad we all get to spend our time together. And it's just been really, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  it's been cool. And I know a lot of people, they want to get to interact more, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=783.04s)]
*  you know, and we do what we can. But I just want to thank everybody for coming out. We did one show [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=786.96s)]
*  that was in a circle and that's damn confused. I mean, it's like, damn, bro, the whole time I feel [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  like I'm performing and asking people for directions, you know, and nobody knows what I mean. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=799.12s)]
*  It just, it was in the round at the Celebrity Theater and this place looked like, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=804.24s)]
*  at the Celebrity Theater and this place looked like, it looked like a White Castle, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  but like the White Castle, like where, you know, where White lived or whatever, you know, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=816.96s)]
*  it looked like the last White Castle, but like the biggest, greatest White Castle. It looked like a CEO, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=826.48s)]
*  where the CEO of White Castle would live, this place. It's in a, just in a big parking lot and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=832.0s)]
*  there's just a damn castle in it, but it's just a low castle. It was just like a short castle. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=837.52s)]
*  It's a low castle, just damn short castling. So if you got a, you know, this castle, it's like a, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=843.52s)]
*  you know, short castle. You're like, damn, what is this? But thank you. I had never done a thing in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=851.12s)]
*  the circle like that. So it's damn, I'm damn dizzy. You know, halfway through the jokes, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=857.92s)]
*  I got a hold on the stool or something. It reminded me of the Gravitron, you know, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=863.52s)]
*  when you go to the fair as a child. You know, where I lived, you'd go to the fair and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=870.88s)]
*  and you'd get on the Gravitron and we'd go over there a day early for 50 cents. They'd let you [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=880.88s)]
*  get on a ride and you were experimental. You didn't realize it. You were a damn lab rat. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=887.6s)]
*  They were testing to make sure that shit worked and make sure there was no lice on the equipment [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=894.88s)]
*  or whatever. Cause that got damn boy. You get on one wrong ride, you itch for a month cause [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=900.08s)]
*  I mean, I swear to God, I have one, but he had two nipples. He itched one of them bitches right off, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=910.16s)]
*  bro. That's how bad he got a body lice. He's down on one damn nipple cause [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=916.24s)]
*  cause the lice, they need a place to meet up at on the body. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=929.84s)]
*  You know, they're just like, they're just like a group of white people at a music festival. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=934.16s)]
*  They, every now and then they got to meet up somewhere and check on everybody. Where's Rhonda? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=941.04s)]
*  How's Ricky? Oh damn. Where's Donna? Oh, well, Tammy and them left. They left. They're gone. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  So, uh, lice are like that. They want a place to meet up and God forbid it becomes your wiener or [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=957.68s)]
*  something like that or inner wiener, that cooter, that end that I dug baby, that end wiener. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=966.72s)]

*  ate that bitch because you get them body lice. But, um, anyway, what I'm trying to tell you guys is, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1010.88s)]
*  oh, yeah, it was like the damn Gravitron, like the shape of the place and the Gravitron. You'd [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1018.88s)]
*  get over there a day early to the, uh, to the parish fair, the county fair, and you pay 50 cents [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1024.72s)]
*  and let you get on the ride and the Gravitron you laid back against the wall and the whole [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1032.72s)]
*  thing would spin. The damn thing was spinning. And it used all the power in the community. Damn, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1037.04s)]
*  your mom's blender would damn shut down seven blocks away. So this bitch could spin. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1045.04s)]
*  And it was, you could hear your, you know, the dad, your dad works at the factory, that bit shut down. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  Everybody's having power outages and right there in the middle of the fairgrounds, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1059.28s)]
*  the Gravitron is spinning there. And then you can't even, it, you get pushed against the side, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1062.96s)]
*  so much inside, you can't close your mouth or eyes. You're just like, yeah, I'm having fun. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1070.16s)]
*  And then the guy right, running it, he'd be in the middle. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1080.72s)]
*  And he was always this rock and roll dude. And you'd be like, do you want a rock? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1084.32s)]
*  And one person, you could barely, the centrifugal force was so strong, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1088.8s)]
*  you could barely get your arm up a little bit like, yes I do. And then he'd damn, that guy would show [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  you his damn wiener every time. That guy was a damn, he was just a visual pedophile, that guy. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1104.72s)]
*  He'd show you that sprout, that body branch, homie. You know what I'm talking about? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1113.36s)]
*  That nut snake baby, that wiener. He'd damn just, and you couldn't, you couldn't close your eyes [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1119.2s)]
*  or anything. Everybody's mouth and eyes were just wide open because you were spinning on the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1127.12s)]
*  Gravitron. And he just, he, you know, he didn't do anything, but he'd show you that bitch. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1130.8s)]
*  So I don't know what we're talking about. Happy Mother's Day. That's what we're trying to say here. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1140.1599999999999s)]
*  And we are grateful to a lot of beautiful mothers out there. We, we love you moms and [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1146.56s)]
*  and thank you for giving us this life, whatever our life is. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1155.28s)]
*  Now the tough part is when you're not enjoying your life, you know, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1160.96s)]
*  to then still find that gratitude to your mother. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1167.2s)]
*  But you know, there's no, there's, I don't know when it happened in time that we started to think [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1170.4s)]
*  that life, while it is extremely unique, right? It's extremely unique. It's so rare. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1175.92s)]
*  You know, Neil deGrasse was on here and he was talking about the rarity that you exist. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1186.72s)]
*  And he was talking about the rarity that you exist. The odds that you exist. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1194.24s)]
*  I mean, you may not, you may, you may hate math, but you are math. You are a equate. You are a [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  carry the one, carry the one million. The odds that we, that you, that I, that any one of us exists [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1210.8s)]
*  they're astronomical. They're astronomical. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1223.76s)]
*  But somewhere along the lines, we, you know, we started to think, I guess, that life was supposed [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1229.6s)]
*  to be a comfort, a comfortable thing. And I don't know when that happened. I think that happened for [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1236.0s)]
*  me too. You know, and maybe some of that is just an American societal idea. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1243.12s)]
*  Since we live in a, and have lived historically in one of the more comfortable countries, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1253.92s)]
*  you know, where we've had a lot of blessings and gifts, you know, we've had a lot of, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1261.84s)]
*  we've had a lot of cash and prizes. We've had a lot of, you know, we have water, we have [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1268.48s)]
*  roofs, we have food, you know, we have our needs met. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1273.28s)]
*  And I think that, that we started to just think that life was, is supposed to be [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1277.44s)]
*  a comfortable journey. But if you look out through time, man, it is not, it's never really been that. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1289.28s)]
*  People have battled plagues, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1298.56s)]
*  a lightning. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1301.2s)]
*  What else? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1310.56s)]
*  AIDS, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1313.52s)]
*  flash flooding, and [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  dangerous animals, baby. All of that. Anyway, I get in my head sometimes that it's this, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1325.9199999999998s)]
*  it's supposed to be this comfortable thing, as opposed to that it's supposed to be this [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1331.04s)]
*  journey. It's supposed to be this experience that doesn't really have any guarantees, you know. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1336.0s)]
*  And I wish I could look at life more that way, because I think I wouldn't, I might have, I might, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1347.68s)]
*  I wouldn't be, I'd probably find less disappointment in things if I looked at life more as like, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1353.84s)]
*  okay, here I am on this journey, as opposed to [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1360.96s)]
*  why isn't my life going a certain way. It'd be more like life [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1367.76s)]
*  was never promised to go a certain way. It's just life. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1375.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, it's just like an idea that, you know, I'm going to be able to do something [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  it's just life. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1391.04s)]
*  You know, it's just like an idea. It comes along. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1395.52s)]
*  It could, anything can happen to it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1400.56s)]
*  So I'm a little all over the place. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  But [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1411.52s)]
*  Oh [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1421.52s)]
*  Oh [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1437.6s)]
*  Yeah, good to be here. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1450.8s)]
*  Thank you for being a part of my life. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1461.6s)]
*  Thank you for blessing me with your time today. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1462.72s)]
*  And we are out here and we are alive. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1466.0s)]
*  And this is life. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1469.68s)]
*  This is what it is. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1472.74s)]
*  You know, if I can accept life on what it is, where it's at, then I'm in a much better [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1475.24s)]
*  space usually. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1483.14s)]
*  You know, if I show up with too many expectations, then I'm going to, man, I'm always going [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1487.32s)]
*  to be disappointed. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1494.76s)]
*  I'm always going to be disappointed. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1503.52s)]
*  But if I can get myself to be like, okay, let's see what's going to happen today. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1507.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's see how it goes. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1513.36s)]
*  Oh, it's going good. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1515.24s)]
*  Oh, it's going bad. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1517.28s)]
*  It's not really going good or bad. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1519.0s)]
*  It's just going. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  But when I start thinking too much, it's going like this. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1526.28s)]
*  It's going like that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1529.26s)]
*  I need it to go like it's like. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1530.26s)]
*  Then I'm almost too attached to it. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1536.1s)]
*  You know, whereas if I can sit back and just watch life kind of happen and not overreact [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1541.1s)]
*  to it, just recognize it's always good. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1545.82s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1548.7s)]
*  Life hadn't been tricking anybody. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1549.9s)]
*  Life's got two hands, bro. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1555.2800000000002s)]
*  And it'll give you some bird seed with one and it'll punch it down. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1557.8200000000002s)]
*  It'll punch you in the fucking neck with the other. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1562.5800000000002s)]
*  That's life. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1566.7s)]
*  Life will hand you a couple little butterscotch's bro with one hand. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1569.0s)]
*  And then while you sucking on them mitts, hit you with the other hand. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1575.8200000000002s)]
*  That's life. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1581.42s)]
*  Life has always done that. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=1583.84s)]

*  Now that's some fucking shit right there, boy. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2572.98s)]
*  So then you're really revealing somebody's gender. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2576.98s)]
*  You're revealing two genders. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2579.98s)]
*  You're saying, hey, the baby's going to be this. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2581.98s)]

*  She got that little semen snout on her, boy. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2608.18s)]
*  Everybody would be damn shocked. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2611.18s)]
*  That's a double gender reveal. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2612.18s)]
*  Then she's going to have a new granddaughter [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2614.18s)]
*  and you're going to have a new father. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2616.18s)]

*  And part of his leg got grilled out a little. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=2713.58s)]

*  a lot of roles that we didn't have [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3363.58s)]

*  able to extend and help me when I've needed it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3369.58s)]

*  I'm a mom, I'm a wife, you know, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3711.58s)]
*  I got a lot of responsibility, but [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3714.58s)]
*  you know, at the end of the day I had to make the decision [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3717.58s)]
*  to help myself, you know, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3720.58s)]
*  because what's the cost if you don't, right? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3723.58s)]
*  So... [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3726.58s)]
*  Amen. Danielle, thank you for the call [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3729.58s)]

*  And yeah, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3735.58s)]
*  you know, mothers are the real... [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3738.58s)]
*  they're the real worst... [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3741.58s)]
*  they're the... [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3744.58s)]
*  you know, mothers, they get it all. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3747.58s)]
*  They get... they're the, you know, it's a lot of... [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3753.58s)]
*  they're the toll booth. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3756.58s)]
*  They're the on-ramp. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3759.58s)]
*  It's a lot of responsibility. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3762.58s)]
*  You're running around with a damn portal [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3767.58s)]
*  between the heavens [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3770.58s)]
*  and existence and the world. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3773.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3776.58s)]
*  I'm sure it is stressful. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3779.58s)]
*  Dear God, I can't even make it through a damn toll booth [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3782.58s)]
*  if I don't have the chains right, I fucking lose my shit. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3785.58s)]
*  So to be carrying a, you know, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3788.58s)]
*  a portal [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3791.58s)]
*  to be... [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3794.58s)]
*  and everything that is... you're like that, you're the Greyhound station [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3797.58s)]
*  of the Lord. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3800.58s)]
*  And you know how much things get left [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3803.58s)]
*  at a Greyhound? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3806.58s)]
*  All kind of this and that and old jacket. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3809.58s)]
*  Somebody left a damn [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3812.58s)]
*  oven mitt over there and half a milk. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3815.58s)]
*  Dude, I saw a sister drinking a can of damn Similac [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3818.58s)]
*  one time. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3821.58s)]
*  Calling somebody a homo on the phone once at Philadelphia [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3824.58s)]
*  over there by the bus, by the Greyhound. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3827.58s)]
*  So it's all kind of shit. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3830.58s)]
*  You know, being a mom, being all that. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3833.58s)]
*  There's a lot coming at you. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3836.58s)]
*  You're a... [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3839.58s)]
*  you're the nucleus, really, of the family [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3842.58s)]
*  in a lot of ways. A lot passing through you. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3845.58s)]
*  And there's a lot that's been going on in history, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3848.58s)]
*  you know, I think so many things happened [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3851.58s)]
*  over the past centuries. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3854.58s)]
*  Wars and battles [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3857.58s)]
*  and love and loss. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3860.58s)]
*  And only now [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3863.58s)]
*  in the present society, really, are we really at a place [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3866.58s)]
*  where we've come up kind of for air, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3869.58s)]
*  where all of our needs are kind of met, where we can [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3872.58s)]
*  look at our emotions, see what's going on, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3875.58s)]
*  how we feel, what's happening. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3878.58s)]
*  And it makes perfect sense to take time [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3887.58s)]
*  and clean your mirror. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3890.58s)]
*  So I'm proud of you. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3893.58s)]
*  Yeah, look, even NASCAR, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3896.58s)]
*  they put them... [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3899.58s)]
*  Dude, they do nine laps in pulling bitches in the shop. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3902.58s)]
*  And those are the most greatest cars on Earth. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3905.58s)]
*  So it makes sense [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3911.58s)]
*  that we take time to take care of ourselves. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3914.58s)]
*  It makes sense that we find ways to be happy [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3917.58s)]
*  and take care of ourselves. So I'm proud of you. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3920.58s)]
*  I don't think there's anything... [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3923.58s)]
*  Yeah, look, this is your time. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3926.58s)]
*  This Mother's Week is your time. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3929.58s)]
*  So, yeah, you take care of yourself. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3932.58s)]
*  Take all the time that you need. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3935.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's important. We have to take care of... [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3938.58s)]
*  Yeah, if you don't have yourself, what do you have? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3941.58s)]
*  Sometimes I find I'm... [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3944.58s)]
*  I'm hurrying for what? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3947.58s)]
*  I've always felt like that [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3950.58s)]
*  in my life. I've gotta hurry, get this done so I can... [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3953.58s)]
*  But there's not a thing. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3956.58s)]
*  There's never a thing that I'm hurrying... [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3959.58s)]
*  It's like somebody's fired a gun [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3962.58s)]
*  at a starting line a long time ago, and I've just been going. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3965.58s)]
*  So take time to take care of yourself. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3972.58s)]
*  Play girl, we doing good. What else? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3975.58s)]
*  Not much, dude. Shaved my chest the other day. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3978.58s)]
*  Feeling okay about that. Little nervous about it. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3981.58s)]
*  You know, my tits don't look [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3984.58s)]
*  exactly like I would like, but that's God. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3987.58s)]
*  That's what He's doing. You know? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3990.58s)]
*  One of my tits looks like a little bit of like a melt. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3993.58s)]
*  Like somebody put a scoop of ice cream, but it's just starting to melt a little. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3996.58s)]
*  So...but hey. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=3999.58s)]
*  Who don't love a little bit of sweet cream? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4002.58s)]
*  Can I have some? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4005.58s)]
*  I want to thank you guys. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4008.58s)]
*  I want to thank you mothers for being mothers. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4011.58s)]
*  We're gonna go out this kind of a sad song. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4014.58s)]
*  But I used to listen to this song a lot [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4017.58s)]
*  when I needed to process feelings of... [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4020.58s)]
*  of connection [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4023.58s)]
*  that I didn't have with my own mother. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4026.58s)]
*  I would listen to this a lot. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4029.58s)]
*  Not all the time, but I would listen to it when I really was in a moment [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4032.58s)]
*  where I was like, okay, I need to... [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4035.58s)]
*  You know, when I could feel some of those feelings come on, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4038.58s)]
*  I would listen to this song because it would help me process them. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4041.58s)]
*  And it would help me get those out of my system. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4044.58s)]
*  You know? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4047.58s)]
*  So... [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4050.58s)]
*  Let's listen to that now. This is Evan Bartels. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4053.58s)]
*  The devil, God, and me. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4056.58s)]
*  Happy Mother's Day to all of the mothers out there. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4059.58s)]
*  We love you. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4062.58s)]
*  And thank you for what you do. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4065.58s)]
*  And thank you. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4068.58s)]
*  Be good to yourselves. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4071.58s)]
*  You know that, baby. Gang. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4074.58s)]
*  Now, this is an emo one. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4082.58s)]
*  So if you don't like that emo, then go on. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4085.58s)]
*  Go on about yourself. Nobody's keeping you here. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4088.58s)]
*  Gang, baby. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8AivVy9eBo&t=4091.58s)]
