*  Yeah, and that was like a mansion. Yeah, it's like a mansion in Beverly Hills [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=142.48s)]
*  in a gated community and it was but [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=147.2s)]

*  2820 acres [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=162.68s)]
*  30,000 square foot [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=167.28s)]
*  Yeah, wait, that's 28 [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=170.64s)]

*  That's unreal isn't it? Yeah [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=181.6s)]
*  That's but let me tell you the thinking. Okay. So so the thinking is this let me push this back [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=183.72s)]
*  So you make some money [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=191.96s)]
*  Yeah, and then you want to keep that money, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  And then you want to do things that you understand and I don't understand much [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=197.24s)]
*  so [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=202.64s)]
*  You know and you've got all these stocks and shares and investments that you can make I don't understand them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  What do I understand? I understand bricks and mortar, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  So if I have some bricks and mortar and the stock market and everything goes to hell in a handbasket [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=215.55999999999997s)]
*  It it still exists the bricks and mortar will be there [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=221.72s)]
*  So I took the money out of the investments and invested it into bricks and mortar [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=229.6s)]
*  And bought this place 20 acres 30,000 square foot blah blah blah blah blah and you just like ah [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=230.12s)]
*  Did a grown-up thing I did a grown-up thing. Yeah, and you've done really proud of myself and then you go, right? Okay [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  What you don't take into consideration is 20 acres needs tendon in Beverly Hills. Oh, yeah, so you need two gardeners and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=244.44s)]
*  Then that's where I come in and yeah [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  Hold on though. So then you've got your [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=256.2s)]
*  Insurance for the house. So the insurance on the house because of the fires is 700 grand [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=258.84s)]
*  Wait, so the insurance because of fires is 700 grand a year. Yeah [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=265.08s)]
*  Seriously, yeah, and then you have your house tax thing each year, which is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=269.96s)]
*  400,000 [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=276.88s)]
*  so basically what you don't take into consideration when you're buying bricks and mortar especially in California is that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=277.96s)]
*  Okay, so you need two gardeners [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=284.28s)]
*  Three housekeepers a house manager Wow, I have security [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=287.66s)]
*  to nannies [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  For you, yeah [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=295.62s)]
*  Just for me. Yeah, so then what so basically what I'm saying is you can't win anyway because you know the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=297.66s)]
*  The the tax of actually the like the life tax right head tax, right of having a property that big [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=306.1s)]
*  You just can't enjoy it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  Come down off the mic a little sorry, it's good [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=316.61999999999995s)]
*  You come downstairs and you see 11 cars parked in your car park outside and they all work at yours [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  Wow, so, you know you what I'm basically wandering around a super yacht [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah on land. Oh, so it's sort of like drain. It's like a super yacht drain [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=332.14s)]
*  But on land why because you constantly just see the money going by you mean? Yeah. Yeah, you just see I walk down and everything [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=338.85999999999996s)]

*  Anyway back to what we were talking on the way in that's the level of money [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=419.08s)]
*  I'm willing to spend on a studio is one where you have to hear something in the distance every day [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=422.12s)]
*  Anxiety, so what's going on? I don't know man. I think I just get over [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=427.8s)]

*  So when I'm listening to you say that you have help and people are helping you [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=452.32s)]
*  I'm like that really perks my ears up cuz I'm like but then but then you just have another level of problems before you go [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=456.0s)]

*  It's just like somebody's like I've got Down syndrome and somebody else is like I've got anxiety [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=487.24s)]
*  And people vote in the crowd. I'd be like I've diarrhea [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=492.68s)]

*  Basically, you've just done high alert all of the time because I'm from [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=512.24s)]
*  Not a lot of money. I mean, I'm from a rough area [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=516.84s)]

*  I love that movie. So there's no anxiety but like I thought [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  That when I was growing up I had like a psychic ability to know that there was gonna be trouble [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=529.16s)]
*  That was I thought that it was like I've got this inbuilt [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=535.24s)]
*  Radar that detects trouble, but actually what it is is you're around sociopaths and psychopaths [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=539.84s)]
*  So you're actually scared all of the time [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=546.96s)]

*  If that makes any sense [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1448.28s)]
*  Well, there's that there's that [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1449.96s)]
*  There's like a few levels [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1452.6s)]
*  Of fame and what it does to you and the the first one is fuck and there's a couple more [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1454.84s)]

*  and but it takes a while to get to [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1488.9199999999998s)]
*  acceptance [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1492.1799999999998s)]
*  And you can't do it. Yeah [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1493.48s)]
*  And then could you go to the shop in england? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1495.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1499.0s)]
*  I could with my covid mask on. Oh, yeah, but you couldn't just like walk down the street and pop in no [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1501.3999999999999s)]
*  really [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1508.36s)]
*  What the car's like oh fuck [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1509.88s)]
*  Well, you know, it's like I have anxiety [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1511.96s)]
*  And I don't like meeting strangers [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1515.0800000000002s)]
*  But like strangers want to meet me [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1519.3200000000002s)]
*  And I feel really uncomfortable about it and it's like thinking about it now actually gives me anxiety [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's like it's a trigger. It's like [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1529.8000000000002s)]
*  And also you've got to be the mayor of the best town that anybody's ever visited [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1532.7600000000002s)]
*  Or else people go he's one of those famous people that are a dick. Oh, yeah [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1537.48s)]
*  You got to be the nicest guy every time the nicest and actually that's hard [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1540.84s)]
*  I I hate having my picture taken. Oh, I fucking hate it. I hate it with my wife [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1545.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like she does instagram and i'm just like the fuck [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1550.84s)]
*  No, like the the act of having a picture taken makes me go [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1555.24s)]
*  For whatever reason that is probably because so much use in the chinese believe this and I don't really even believe in the chinese [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1560.84s)]
*  A lot of times but I believe that it takes your soul. Yeah, it's not the child. I thought it was like the indians [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1566.52s)]
*  Otherwise the indians. I think that's a made up. Well, the chinese borrowed it because I remember [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1572.44s)]
*  I was in china one time trying to take a picture of somebody and they're like no [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1577.8s)]
*  They come up and try to cover the camera [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1581.16s)]
*  Yeah, they don't want because it like they said like it captures a little bit of you [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1582.68s)]
*  so I think it could make sense that after someone has been so like [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1586.12s)]
*  And I don't want to use the term exploited but you [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1589.96s)]
*  You know so much of your image and your voice and everything is used for [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1592.68s)]
*  uh [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1596.92s)]
*  artwork or ambiance or [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1598.7600000000002s)]
*  Transaction or whatever that something's got to leave out of your spirit. It seems like it seemed like it would [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1602.0200000000002s)]
*  Do you feel that at all? Did you ever? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1607.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, then it takes a bit your soul. Yeah, maybe subconsciously that's what it is that makes me feel anxious about it [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1609.8000000000002s)]
*  But the what happens in the process is this is that i'm a chronic people pleaser, too [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1616.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I want you to think that i'm the nicest person that you've ever met because if you don't and you go away [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1621.1599999999999s)]
*  having a bad [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1627.72s)]
*  Time having met me i'll feel really awful [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1629.56s)]
*  But also at the same time [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1633.24s)]
*  That's fucking but but also at the same time is like I don't want you to have any time with me at all [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1635.72s)]
*  So I I what I do is I become agoraphobic but like happily agoraphobic [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=1642.04s)]

*  So, um [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2531.9s)]
*  This guy's like a halfway house for your time. Okay [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2534.46s)]
*  question have you been close to [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2538.3s)]
*  having [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2542.3s)]
*  Uh a committed relationship with somebody no [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2543.66s)]
*  Never i've been in some but i've just always been like cheating or running around. I just think there's some I have some [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2547.5s)]
*  like complete [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2553.98s)]
*  agitation towards like [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2556.44s)]
*  anything [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2558.36s)]

*  But I think things like that feel like they own me like a relationship or anything saying this is mine [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2561.9s)]
*  Now you're a sober person. Yeah, would you? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2567.1800000000003s)]

*  I think that's why for the past like I haven't gotten in a relationship in a long time, you know [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2579.98s)]
*  and now it's been about four years, but [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2583.9s)]
*  uh [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2586.54s)]
*  Because I got to do some work in some of that space, you know, i'm trying to work in slaa right now [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2587.9s)]
*  and [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2593.9s)]
*  you just even just like little things like go two weeks without interacting with [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2595.02s)]
*  Texting anything with women, you know, just little things like that to try and like just get on your own two feet [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2599.6600000000003s)]
*  You know just so i'm not using interactions with women as an outlet for like uncomfort [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2605.58s)]
*  That's what I do. I get a little uncomfortable and then it's like oh [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2611.34s)]
*  Maybe set up a date sometimes so I want to have things be more meaningful and i'm going through my steps again right now [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2615.5s)]
*  So i've had some slips over the uh, yeah me too. Oh right. Yeah, not over the pandemic [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2620.94s)]
*  But in general have you come close to being with somebody that you just think is [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2625.98s)]
*  She's amazing [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2631.58s)]
*  There was a girl I was seeing that was really great. Uh [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2633.66s)]
*  And I think now when I think about it makes me feel kind of sad because I wasn't I didn't really meet her halfway [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2637.74s)]
*  You know and because then I feel bad because I kind of monopolize their time, you know [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2642.14s)]
*  That's what I feel the worst about I think you monopolize their time [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2646.3799999999997s)]
*  How by like knowing I wasn't really ready to have a strong commitment but letting them believe that I was you know [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2649.18s)]
*  And how long ago was that? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2658.06s)]
*  it was probably the last relationship I was in it's been honestly been all of them really but [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2659.98s)]
*  I think it hurts more the older we get because it's like, you know, people's time is more precious to them [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2664.3799999999997s)]
*  And also, you know you think that you're gonna have this all sorted [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2669.82s)]
*  Uh in the near future. Yeah, and then you walk through the horizon and you're 41. Yeah, and it's not sorted [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2674.94s)]
*  And it's still the problem that it was when you were 24. Yeah, it's a little better when I look at mark [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2682.2200000000003s)]
*  It's almost like you know, like in uh, the movie where the christmas people where they go look in the window and they see the past [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2687.42s)]
*  Yeah, so that's where I was kind of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=2692.38s)]

*  If you could be born a different nationality [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6123.4400000000005s)]

*  But in australia, they just allow me to be me and my sense of humor and they don't misquote me [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6160.16s)]
*  And the you know the and the it's like [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6167.679999999999s)]

*  and then beau is a little bit more like uh [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6453.219999999999s)]
*  Uh french french. Yeah, bow regard. Yeah, I don't want it bow to be called bow regard. That's a good name. No, it's [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6457.86s)]
*  Bow regard no, it's not bow regard [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6466.0199999999995s)]

*  Yeah, but still dude, you need to be from uh, east sasks. Is that a place east it sounds like one. Yeah. Yeah [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6475.62s)]
*  What about okay is is so here's a question for you right anxiety [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6484.5s)]
*  How's your anxiety been during because we're heading to the end now, aren't we? Yeah [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6488.58s)]
*  So how's your anxiety been through this podcast? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6492.74s)]
*  Mine's been good until you asked me a question [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6496.02s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6498.82s)]
*  You've just been you've just been the audience. Yeah popping in you've done a great job of being that mark's very supportive [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6500.02s)]
*  I will say it's one really [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6505.78s)]
*  I mean he has a lot of great characteristics. One of them is that he's very supportive [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6507.62s)]
*  He's a good committee. You just can't understand what he's saying [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6510.74s)]
*  It's almost trickery because he can be like i'm great at this and then you just don't know what he's talking about [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6513.46s)]
*  My new thing is to explain the joke to the audience. I'm like, all right. This is why somebody didn't laugh [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6517.62s)]
*  Let me announce it. Do you do you worry about that being in america and [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6522.26s)]
*  Trying to being successful in the career that you're choosing to be but in a place where they can't understand you [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6527.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, i'm just trying to figure out how to navigate it. Yeah, do you clip your words so that people yeah sometimes [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6533.38s)]
*  Like instead of like if I say the path [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6539.7s)]
*  I have to be like oh i was on the sidewalk [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6543.62s)]
*  Yeah, but not it's it's not you know, like bonnet boot. It's not all of that. It's your accent [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6546.26s)]
*  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, definitely i'll be like I even but if I call it out if I say like [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6552.9s)]
*  I went to the bar. Yeah, and then people are like he went to the bear [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6558.099999999999s)]
*  And i'm like, oh I went to the bar [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6562.0199999999995s)]
*  So people know you're at the bar. Yeah, but like [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6564.34s)]
*  Yeah, but like if you're road testing material and you're like that didn't work [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6569.139999999999s)]
*  He's like, do you know if it didn't work because they just didn't understand it. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I have to figure it out [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6573.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, oh if I even say like the stair like she had stairs in her feeling on her ceiling [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6577.0599999999995s)]
*  She had stairs on her feeling that's a rash mark [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6583.38s)]
*  But I was like, why do they not get and I I figured out then they think i'm saying she had stairs on her feeling [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6587.3s)]
*  On her ceiling right right right. So I'd be like, oh no stars like twinkle twinkle. I just have to explain it a bit more [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6592.9s)]
*  I have to treat the audience like they're dumb. Yeah, do you know what that means? [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6600.099999999999s)]
*  We're getting dumb here dude america. We're getting dumb fast man [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6605.0599999999995s)]
*  Uh, there was one more interesting thing I was gonna ask you but I think I almost forgot what it was [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6608.82s)]
*  Well, I don't get too much anxiety around you. Uh, you see you're very welcoming [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6614.1s)]
*  I think you have a very welcoming and inviting personality ask a lot of questions and so I think it [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6618.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel a ton of anxiety around you. Do you um when you do podcasts do you [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6623.7s)]
*  Revise the night before or do you just rock up and and hit it? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6629.9400000000005s)]
*  Sometimes I revise, you know when I talk with mark about you coming in like, you know, I know about your career [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6634.66s)]
*  But I didn't know like what your energy was like really [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6639.54s)]
*  um, but mark, you know [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6642.74s)]
*  Just say you're basically just a pretty normal guy to be around and then it's engaging conversation [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6645.22s)]
*  And so I didn't think too far past that. Uh, we got some questions from folks [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6650.66s)]
*  And then yeah, just like to kind of see what's going on with the day [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6656.18s)]
*  but if we had an author come in then we like we had an author come in the other day and so with him we [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6658.66s)]
*  You know went through and read like half the book as much as I could [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6664.58s)]
*  Do you think joe rogan sort of just rocks up these days or do you think that he puts in a bit of? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6667.62s)]
*  I think it's a mix. I think joe rogan and this is something I learned about him recently was that he always was very [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6674.1s)]
*  People would say he talked too much [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6681.14s)]
*  He said he said people when I was younger would say man, you talk too much, you know [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6682.66s)]
*  And then look what he did with he like is extremely curious [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6686.58s)]
*  So he has I think a very curious nature so [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6690.9800000000005s)]
*  Curiosity, I think if you have it inside of you it makes your brain [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6694.8s)]
*  It like gives your face questions all the time to give to ask someone so if your curiosity is really working [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6698.02s)]
*  um, I think my curiosity works better when i'm feeling good when i'm not like in a [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6704.1s)]
*  Space of self very much where my brain isn't kind of worrying about things in my own world [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6709.46s)]
*  So I think the healthier I am mentally and stuff the more curiosity I have and the better I do [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6713.9400000000005s)]
*  But what do I think joe does I think at this point he probably has enough comfort with how to do certain things [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6718.5s)]
*  He knows the mechanism. Yeah, do you um when you when you're doing podcasts, do you [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6724.9s)]
*  find that you are [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6730.5s)]
*  Insanely concentrating [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6732.96s)]
*  Do you find like for example when i'm doing a podcast whether I [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6735.46s)]
*  I did one interview where I was asking the questions for the rest of the time i'm on podcasts [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6739.219999999999s)]
*  I am just hyper focused [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6743.46s)]
*  Wow, are you hyper focused in these moments or I was watching you do the nick thing the nick swanson thing [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6745.7s)]
*  And it was just like it was just chatting the shit between two people and it felt very [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6752.02s)]
*  Natural and it felt very comfortable. Yeah, because I I if i'm if this is on and i'm here [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6756.24s)]
*  I am just like like i've taken seven adderall [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6762.18s)]
*  Let me think I guess I do feel more focused than usual. It's kind of a respite from the rest of my day [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6767.06s)]
*  So i'm grateful that I have to think about other people and you know, just be involved with others [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6771.62s)]
*  So that's nice, but do I feel hyper focused? I think it depends [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6776.66s)]
*  I know that people like when people are just having a conversation [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6781.78s)]
*  When it doesn't feel sometimes like there's a ton of planning [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6784.98s)]
*  I find so and what does the rest of your day look like the rest of my day looks like [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6788.18s)]
*  I'll probably patch up with these guys and make sure everything's good. Look at some social media clips and stuff like that [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6793.86s)]
*  um [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6800.1s)]
*  I gotta [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6801.78s)]
*  Check in with a sponsor. So I had a little bit of a falling out with a sponsor [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6803.14s)]
*  So I need to check in with him and decide what i'm gonna do [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6807.06s)]
*  Are you are you on meds? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6810.26s)]
*  No, i've been off for like about two months, but it's also scary because I feel like I had uh, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6812.1s)]
*  Because I got on them like 15 years ago. So it's like why are you off him? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6817.9400000000005s)]
*  I think because I just had I felt like I wasn't having a lot of feelings [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6821.54s)]
*  So i'm like is one of the reasons i'm not having feelings because i'm on [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6825.3s)]
*  These meds like part of me I was thinking sometimes like it's hard for me to like I feel like if I want to like fall [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6829.14s)]
*  In love with somebody [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6833.54s)]
*  So I was like maybe i'm not maybe i'm not maybe i'm not feeling love because I don't and how do you feel about that? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6835.14s)]
*  Being two months off them now [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6841.9400000000005s)]
*  I feel like I have a lot of like i've been kind of like [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6844.1s)]
*  A little bit more tearful honestly, dude a little bit more emotional. Yeah. Yeah, so that's been a little bit [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6847.62s)]
*  Kind of almost a little bit alarming [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6853.38s)]
*  But then part of me is like maybe there's these feelings that have been needing to get out for so long [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6854.74s)]
*  And they haven't so I just don't know for me and I am not yeah, obviously we're not doctors [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6858.5s)]
*  We're not doctors and i'm not saying i'm not we've never had a doctor in here mark's a doctor [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6863.62s)]
*  I'm not suggesting anybody doing what i'm doing at all. It's not what i'm saying just how this is working for me [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6869.46s)]
*  I'm on motherfucking meds and that's the way it's going to stay. Wow, that's it. I am totally in [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6874.66s)]
*  I don't need to go and evaluate see if there's some feelings that need come and coming out [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6880.5s)]
*  Is that I I spent [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6886.18s)]
*  I would say [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6888.900000000001s)]
*  1990 to [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6891.4400000000005s)]
*  2006 [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6896.080000000001s)]
*  in abject [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6898.900000000001s)]
*  misery of some form or another because of [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6900.5s)]
*  my poor mental health [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6904.42s)]
*  And I don't want to waste another second in there [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6907.06s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense, you know, and that's that's for me, you know, it's like i'm in the relationship with my mrs [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6911.7s)]
*  I've got the kids [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6919.86s)]
*  Uh for me, it makes total sense just to be like, okay. This is my life. This is what I need for it to happen [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6922.02s)]
*  Uh, this is what i'm doing. Wow [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6929.22s)]
*  I think about that too. I think about getting back on actually [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6931.9400000000005s)]
*  Yesterday was the first time I thought about what were you on just on sertraline or something generic prozac I think [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6935.06s)]
*  Fluoxetine what what what milligram pretty low dose like 10? Yeah, maybe 15. Okay, it's nothing. There's [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6940.48s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6948.42s)]
*  And and have you not had the zaps? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6949.54s)]
*  The the coming off them. How did you wean off them? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6952.18s)]
*  Uh, I weaned, uh pretty decently like cutting down pills getting the smallest pills and then cutting them in half and stuff like that [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6955.7s)]
*  No, I haven't had anything like that. I've just been more emotional. I noticed like I start talking to somebody and then i'm balling up [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6962.26s)]
*  And then they're like, so this is a carl's junior [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6967.78s)]
*  You know, you know and we're closed [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRCxNJZ8cdM&t=6971.78s)]
