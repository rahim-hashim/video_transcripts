*  We'll include everybody. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=16.0s)]
*  This week, February 2nd, I'm in Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=19.6s)]

*  Did you know? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=313.06s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=314.06s)]

*  All right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=317.82s)]
*  I mean, this is for real. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=318.82s)]
*  In 2014, when I met. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=319.82s)]
*  OK, hold on. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=321.82s)]
*  What was the climate of the world in 2014? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=322.82s)]
*  2014. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=324.82s)]
*  We're kind of getting along pretty well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=325.82s)]
*  We were getting along. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=327.14s)]
*  We had Obama as president. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=328.14s)]
*  You know, there were real no problems on the horizon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=330.1s)]
*  You know, China was starting to act up a little bit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  You're starting to hear, you know, like China was always like, watch them a little bit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=335.18s)]
*  But we really didn't have the problems we have right now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=339.14s)]
*  You know, we were two years away from being saved by Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=342.82s)]
*  And now we're back in the bullshit. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=345.62s)]
*  But so it was kind of like a little bit of a glory days. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=347.7s)]
*  But I was single. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=350.26s)]
*  I had been single for six months. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=351.26s)]
*  Had you been dating kind of vigorously? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  Had you been doing sex a lot? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=356.34s)]
*  I had been again, just being completely 100 percent vulnerable and honest from the time [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=358.14s)]
*  from from from January of 2014 until August of 2014. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes. Early. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=369.86s)]
*  I I contracted chlamydia so many times that my primary care doctor gave me my own [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=370.66s)]
*  prescription of azithromycin, which is what cures chlamydia, almost like a male birth control. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=376.70000000000005s)]

*  because 100 percent of the time, even if I do, I would never wash my hands before COVID. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=722.9000000000001s)]
*  I was like, I don't need to wash my hands unless I was in a porta potty. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=727.5s)]
*  So with the porta potty, the hard part is getting the door open. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=730.9000000000001s)]
*  You almost got to kick it with your foot and let it bounce a little and then catch it with your foot. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=734.58s)]
*  Yeah, you got to do something. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=738.62s)]
*  You got to act like you don't have even have hands like you just got nubs. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=739.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So so I. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=742.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm there. I pay. I come out. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=746.2600000000001s)]

*  I used to be a physical therapist. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  I had a patient, I should say, that was just a torso. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=753.1400000000001s)]
*  Let's say is it called a patient with your physical? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=756.3800000000001s)]
*  Yes. No, they would call us patients. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=758.98s)]
*  And we technically have doctorate degrees. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=760.7s)]
*  I mean, I have a doctorate degree. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=762.34s)]
*  I would never call myself doctor. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=763.38s)]
*  Some of my classmates did. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=764.58s)]
*  And that's bullshit. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=766.54s)]
*  But they were called patients. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=767.66s)]
*  And I met he was a torso, just a toy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=768.86s)]
*  I had no arms, no legs. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=771.0600000000001s)]
*  And he was a man. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=772.22s)]
*  Does he speak at churches? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=773.02s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=774.38s)]
*  I think he's no longer with us. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=775.34s)]
*  But he was just a full torso. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=777.14s)]
*  Oh, wow. And it was crazy to see. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=779.14s)]
*  But he would maneuver it like he would get shit done just rolling around. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=780.66s)]
*  But you know, Sternim Ernie. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=784.02s)]
*  Yeah, it was just it was wild. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=785.3000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=787.14s)]
*  And does he have a spine or not, or just like a rib cage? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=787.9s)]
*  No, he had a full head, spine, everything. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=790.22s)]
*  But he was just just think about like a mannequin with no arms, no legs. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=791.9s)]
*  Just think about. Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=795.18s)]
*  You're talking so fast. It's hard for me to know. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=796.62s)]
*  Sorry. Well, think about a mannequin. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  Sorry. I'm sorry. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=800.3s)]
*  So thinking about a mannequin. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  All right. And what else? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=803.5s)]
*  No arms, no legs. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=805.42s)]
*  All right. Head, brain, spine. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=806.74s)]
*  OK. Tattoo on his rib cage. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=810.22s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=812.9399999999999s)]
*  Didn't see that coming. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=815.14s)]
*  Yep. And he was having [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=816.14s)]
*  he was having I think it was shoulder issues because easily neck, neck, shoulder, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=818.66s)]
*  because it's all you got left. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just his neck. Yeah. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=826.06s)]
*  And he was born that way, by the way. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=827.46s)]
*  He wasn't in an accident. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=829.22s)]
*  And this is true. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=830.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm I'm you know, I could probably prove it to you. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=832.3s)]
*  He was also a hermaphrodite. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=835.22s)]
*  Oh, wow. So he was and he was blind in one eye. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=836.66s)]
*  This is I'm not making any of this up. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=839.22s)]
*  I can't say his name because that's against HIPAA. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=841.5s)]
*  You know, but but he is the patient. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=843.62s)]
*  If anyone who worked with me at NYU in, you know, summer, spring [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=845.86s)]
*  or whatever it was of 2010, you know exactly who I'm talking about. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=854.26s)]
*  Well, that's probably not a lot of it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=855.5s)]
*  And that's, you know, you know, I think you got big. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=856.62s)]

*  I'm there. It's July 6th of 2014. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=868.14s)]
*  OK. I see who's going to eventually become my [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=871.26s)]
*  the the mother of my two beautiful children. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=875.66s)]
*  And so when I saw her, dude, I'll never forget. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=878.38s)]
*  I saw I was drinking a strawberry vodka. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=881.02s)]
*  I have a fun. I was probably, you know, on an app looking for Domino's pizza. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=883.3s)]
*  I'm always anytime I drink, even though New York City has the best Italian food, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=886.1s)]
*  every time I drink, I always want pizza hut and Domino's. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=889.42s)]
*  I think it's just pain. It's just a cycle of pain. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=891.3s)]
*  It's like I want to look in the mirror and be like, you fucking suck. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=893.42s)]
*  You eat that Domino's bitch. Oh, yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=895.78s)]
*  Something like that. Like BDSM. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=897.74s)]
*  Yeah. It's like like a suicidal thing, you know, like Italian BDSM. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=899.54s)]
*  Yes. Yes. So I say I see her. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=903.3399999999999s)]
*  I see her and she's like dancing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=906.4599999999999s)]
*  And it was one of those things where it was like almost like in a movie [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=908.3s)]
*  where I was like, like truthfully, I was like my heart like stopped. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=910.9s)]
*  Like I was like, like it's the only time I ever felt that in my life. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=914.8599999999999s)]
*  Well, I looked at her and I was like, oh, my God. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=918.18s)]
*  Like like the beauty was like like floored. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=921.14s)]
*  And again, like I said, I was I I said everything before I had, you know, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=924.14s)]
*  we're talking to beautiful women and Ben. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=928.66s)]
*  So she was beautiful, like, you know, there were other girls, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=930.8199999999999s)]
*  but there was something different about her. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=933.2199999999999s)]
*  And I said to my boy, Patty, Patty Flyballs, who I never he was chewing on a straw. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=935.5799999999999s)]
*  And I said to him, I do that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=939.98s)]
*  Yeah. I said to him, I said, I said, dude, look at how beautiful that woman is. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=941.8199999999999s)]
*  And he was like, I know she's amazing. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=946.86s)]
*  And I was like, he agreed. He agreed. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=948.8199999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I was like, I said that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=950.74s)]
*  I said, I said that literally is the hottest girl I've ever seen in my life. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=952.9399999999999s)]
*  I was like, I can't even think right now. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=957.06s)]
*  And he was like, oh, he was like, bro, relax. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=958.42s)]
*  What did you do then? You left? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=960.34s)]
*  No. So he goes, he goes, dude, yes, she's a smoking hot Puerto Rican chick. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=961.86s)]
*  Like, I get it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=965.0600000000001s)]
*  Like and I said, I got to go up and talk to her. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=965.9s)]
*  I said I literally was like inside of me, I was like, if I do not talk to her, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=970.02s)]
*  like this is going to bother me for the rest of my fucking life. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=973.74s)]
*  Like, I'm never going to forget this woman. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=976.1s)]
*  So I go up to her and I say, listen, I said, I, you know, I saw you from across. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=977.7s)]
*  Was the music loud? Was it hard to get her attention? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=982.74s)]
*  That part, I don't remember because I was enamored because, you know, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=985.5s)]
*  was amazing about her. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=988.26s)]
*  She was so beautiful and obviously is so beautiful. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=989.46s)]
*  But the thing is, what I focus on is she has a chipped tooth. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=992.1s)]
*  So I was looking at her chipped tooth because I was like, wow, you know, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=994.74s)]
*  like from afar, like you don't notice you have a chipped tooth. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  But then when I get closer, it's almost like the chipped tooth. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1000.1s)]
*  It even made it more beautiful because it's like it's unique. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1002.26s)]
*  It's almost like a like a hot chick with a scar. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1004.4200000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I was like, I like this. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1006.5400000000001s)]
*  This is unique. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1008.3000000000001s)]
*  It's almost like you got to buy a vowel or something. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1008.82s)]
*  Yeah. Like one of the most beautiful women I've ever met besides her has no pinkies. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1010.82s)]
*  And I was like, and she's a smoke show, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1015.6600000000001s)]
*  but she's got no pinkies and she hides them. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1017.62s)]
*  But she's you don't meet people that don't have pinkies. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1019.5s)]
*  And she doesn't have them. But she's gorgeous. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1022.42s)]
*  Wow. It's almost like a sloth almost. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1024.7s)]
*  Yes. Dude, I'll tell you this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1026.94s)]
*  First girl I ever kissed had a chipped tooth. Yep. Yep. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1028.7s)]
*  And they made us kiss. We were in love, man. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1032.46s)]
*  I don't know if we were in love, but we live near each other. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1034.34s)]
*  Well, sometimes that's all it takes. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1037.06s)]
*  That's what being in love was and being married was in ancient times. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1038.18s)]
*  You just knew the people in your village. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1041.1s)]
*  That's why this whole concept of a soulmate. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1043.02s)]
*  There's nine billion people in this world, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1046.46s)]
*  and we're all connected through Mark Zuckerberg, the God. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1048.18s)]

*  Did you go outside and warm up or do you just warm up? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1461.46s)]
*  Right. You just drink it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1463.18s)]

*  Yeah. So I start. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1473.7s)]
*  So they play that song. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1475.26s)]
*  Nothing's further than being happily married and sitting somewhere [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1476.58s)]
*  with two Irish dude. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1479.58s)]

*  like, you know, like they're watching the Mets. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1489.98s)]
*  They were trying to get the Mets score. Yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1491.98s)]
*  And and and so I just did that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1493.6599999999999s)]
*  I did that dance, played that song. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1496.06s)]
*  She kind of giggled and she goes and she goes, that was a nice attempt. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1498.06s)]
*  She goes, that was a nice attempt. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1502.54s)]
*  And she goes, how about this? I'll tell you my name. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1503.78s)]
*  So she tells me her name. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1506.06s)]
*  And I was like, OK. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1507.78s)]
*  And she goes, and then what I almost it almost was like it was a setup. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1508.94s)]
*  But I swear to God, it wasn't. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1513.34s)]
*  I had been on a show on MTV called Guy Code and Girl Code, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1514.46s)]
*  which is relatively still popular. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1517.7s)]
*  Yeah. I remember Jessamay and the other Carly and Andrew Schultz [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1519.5s)]
*  and all those guys, guys and girls. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1524.82s)]
*  So so I I. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1527.1s)]
*  Somebody came up to me and wanted a picture with me from that show. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1532.5s)]
*  And then she was like, why do they want a picture with you? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1535.18s)]

*  And she was like, you still aren't watching MTV. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1542.94s)]
*  And I was like, no, I'm not watching it. I'm just on the show. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1545.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's just a that's just that's fine, man. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1548.0600000000002s)]
*  You're not a bad guy. That's just a business choice. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1550.78s)]
*  I was like, I was like, you know, I needed I'm just I'm working. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1553.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm working. She said that the Puerto Rican. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1556.66s)]
*  Yeah, she said that to me. She was like, you what do you want? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1558.46s)]
*  Right. And so I said, I'm just working. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1560.22s)]
*  They trust a lot of television. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1562.22s)]
*  Puerto Ricans are more they're more real life. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1563.34s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1567.34s)]
*  She's like if I was working at a gas station or something like that, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1568.3s)]
*  I'd be more like this is my kind of guy. Right. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1570.6599999999999s)]
*  But so she was like, OK. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1572.5s)]
*  And then she said, she said, what's the show? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1574.26s)]
*  And I told her, she goes, all right, maybe I'll look it up one day. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1576.98s)]
*  And I was like, OK, well, it could take forever, dude. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1579.54s)]
*  She's so vague. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1583.1s)]
*  Does she know we only have a lifetime? I know, dude. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1584.26s)]
*  So then she goes so then she goes. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1586.9399999999998s)]
*  She was like fucking with me. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1589.6599999999999s)]
*  So she goes, she goes, all right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1591.1s)]
*  She goes, look, this one. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1593.26s)]
*  She goes, I'm leaving. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1594.6599999999999s)]
*  She goes, I got I got to get home. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1596.4199999999998s)]
*  She goes, I got to get home to my son. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1598.02s)]
*  So that was so when she said that, got the S bomb, dropped the bomb. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1600.1399999999999s)]
*  So in my heart, my heart, I said, get home to my chlamydia. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1603.62s)]
*  I said, I said, if you get I said, because already then I said, OK, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1608.1399999999999s)]

*  She goes, no. And I said, is so is the son's father around? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1616.62s)]
*  I said, is he is he deceased? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1620.9s)]
*  And she was like, why would you want him to be deceased? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1622.5800000000002s)]
*  I was like, I don't. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1624.26s)]
*  I was just I was just hoping that he was so I could step in and be a stepdad. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1624.9s)]
*  Like, I just said that immediately. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1628.74s)]
*  And she was like, you're like crazy. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1629.9s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1631.94s)]
*  And she was like, and she was like, he's still in the picture. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1633.02s)]
*  I was like, OK. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1636.18s)]
*  So but when she said that to me, I already felt inferior to him. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1637.1000000000001s)]
*  So I said to myself in my heart and head at that moment, I said, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1639.8600000000001s)]
*  the first time I have sex with this woman, I'm not pulling out. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1642.7s)]
*  I need to get her pregnant to to even the playing field. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1644.9s)]

*  You went full Puerto Rican. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1648.26s)]
*  And that's eventually what I did. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1649.58s)]
*  FYI, no way. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1651.34s)]

*  Because I felt so inferior to this guy. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1672.86s)]
*  I didn't even know. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1674.74s)]
*  And I was like, this is the woman of my dreams. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1675.74s)]
*  I'm going to play hardball. I need this. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1677.6599999999999s)]
*  He's got one on the board. I'm going to get one on the board. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1679.22s)]

*  Yeah. So so I kind of like this. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1688.38s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I went all in because everyone was like, you're crazy. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1691.6200000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I feel like I'm in an Uber X with no brakes. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1694.58s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I was like, yeah, maybe I am. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1697.42s)]
*  So then finally, I'll never forget. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1699.5s)]
*  I was at Minnesota at Target Field. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1701.7s)]
*  I was at the MLB All-Star Game, watching the game. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1704.14s)]
*  Derek Jeter's final MLB All-Star Game. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1706.9s)]
*  I'm a huge Yankees fan. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1708.98s)]
*  I get a message from an Instagram message from an account I wasn't sure of. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1710.26s)]
*  And it was just a dog laying on the floor like this. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1715.6200000000001s)]
*  Just it looked like a dead dog. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1718.9s)]
*  So I was like, this is weird. This is wild. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1720.6200000000001s)]
*  And then it said, it said, this is me giving in. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1723.06s)]
*  She said, this is me giving in. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1726.98s)]
*  And she goes and she gave me her phone number besides the last digit. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1728.94s)]
*  She goes, so she was really, I mean, making me work. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1734.74s)]
*  That would be Memento or whatever. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1737.42s)]
*  Yes, she gave me the last digit. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1738.66s)]
*  So I went through all the digits. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1739.8600000000001s)]
*  I went through all of them and I just texted this number. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1742.7s)]
*  And I just kept trying that digit until... [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1745.66s)]
*  Yeah, and most of them were like, who is this? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1747.66s)]
*  Some of them were other languages. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1749.42s)]
*  Somebody sent me back Chinese symbols. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1750.5400000000002s)]
*  And then finally, yeah, I was like, could that be her? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1752.2600000000002s)]
*  I was like, Jazz? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1755.7800000000002s)]
*  So then finally, I got the digit. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1759.1000000000001s)]
*  The last digit was actually a zero. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1760.8600000000001s)]
*  I started at one like an idiot. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1762.3400000000001s)]
*  And then it's so zero. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1764.2600000000002s)]
*  I thought it was just started with zero and it nailed it on the first try. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1765.54s)]
*  So I finally got her and she said, look, she broke down. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1767.98s)]
*  She was like, I have a son. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1772.02s)]
*  I'm not looking for anything serious. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1773.3s)]
*  But, you know, she goes, you seem like a funny guy. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1775.18s)]
*  She was like, I looked up your stuff. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1778.02s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1779.42s)]
*  She was like, I was the guy that I was with. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1780.54s)]
*  She was like, it was a casual, stupid thing. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1782.8600000000001s)]
*  She was like, if you want to take me out, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1784.98s)]
*  you know, I have to make arrangements for my son. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1787.18s)]
*  I'm free, you know, next Saturday. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1789.54s)]
*  Now, was there a lot of pressure? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1792.02s)]
*  Because if somebody says they got a son and then [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1793.14s)]
*  because you're almost like if you take somebody out that has a son, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1795.18s)]
*  yeah, you've got to have a little bit more of a plan or like be real serious. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1798.18s)]
*  I think. Yeah. Well, he was three at the time. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1802.46s)]
*  And when I opened the door, when she opened the door for me, you can hear him. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1803.94s)]
*  No, he showed up in his karate outfit. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1807.22s)]
*  He had a karate outfit on with his orange belt with a headband on. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1809.1000000000001s)]
*  And he was holding me in hatred. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1812.46s)]
*  And why would he have to be dressed like saying he was holding a mat's [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1813.8600000000001s)]
*  apple juice, just looking at me. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1816.38s)]
*  And why was he dressed like that? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1817.9s)]
*  Because I think he just wanted to let him know, like, let me know that he knows [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1818.94s)]
*  karate if I mess with his mom. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1821.74s)]
*  Fuck, that's crazy. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1823.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1824.8999999999999s)]
*  It's crazy, dude. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1826.02s)]
*  And I've since you know, he's my stepson. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1826.74s)]
*  I live with me. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1828.78s)]
*  So he so he you know, Jasmine has since told me like, yeah, he put that on. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1829.6599999999999s)]
*  When I told him, mommy's going to go out with a friend and she he was like, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1833.78s)]
*  is that is a guy? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1836.74s)]
*  And when she said yes, then he put it on every time he smells apple. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1837.78s)]
*  She just breaks a board. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1841.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1842.26s)]
*  And he you know, he still ice grills the shit out of me every time I give him [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1843.1399999999999s)]
*  his breakfast and stuff. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1845.78s)]
*  You know, like, yeah, he's still like, dude, never forget you ain't my dad. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1846.6999999999998s)]
*  So you took her out. Where do you take her? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1849.8999999999999s)]
*  So that's what happened. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1851.54s)]
*  So I took her out because this is good for me, man, because I want to be in love. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1853.14s)]
*  You know, so I want to know how what do I do to get there? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1856.7800000000002s)]
*  So what happened was is I took her. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1863.14s)]
*  I took her to at that time, I was performing at a place called [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1865.74s)]
*  McGuire's Comedy Club at the end of Long Island. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1869.26s)]
*  That's the Saturday. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1872.38s)]
*  I said, listen, if you would you like to come to a comedy show? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1873.22s)]
*  I picked her up. I had a Toyota Corolla, but it was a nice one. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1875.6200000000001s)]
*  But it was a nice one, dude. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1878.46s)]
*  It was like a two thousand. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1879.6200000000001s)]
*  Do they have a nice one? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1880.42s)]
*  It was a 2014 at Automatic Windows. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1881.58s)]
*  A lot of them have the Rollo's, but I had automatic windows at the time and locks. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1883.7s)]
*  Right when she's walking out of the car, do you do all four windows down? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1886.8999999999999s)]
*  It's a show where they all do it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1889.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, no, I got out of the car. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1890.82s)]
*  I rang the bell like proper gentleman. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1892.26s)]
*  I had a rose for her that I bought from the Chinese man on the corner. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1894.26s)]
*  Yes. I had a rose for her. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1897.06s)]
*  And she was like, that's sweet. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1898.58s)]
*  And I was like, thanks. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1900.06s)]
*  And then I told her, I was like, this isn't my real car. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1901.1399999999999s)]
*  And she was like, where's your real car? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1904.1s)]
*  I was like, it's up here. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1905.3799999999999s)]
*  I was like, we're going to get my real car. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1906.74s)]

*  I was like, and there's nobody at the show. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1918.5s)]
*  But I was like, trust me, one day I'm going to have a gold bracelet. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1920.02s)]
*  And you really tell her all this? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1922.94s)]
*  I swear to God, I was like, and she was like, you don't have to build yourself up. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1924.1s)]
*  She was like, I think it's cool. You do comedy. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1926.58s)]
*  I think it's brave. She was like, I don't care if you have a Toyota. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1928.06s)]
*  Like, it's a nice car. I have a son. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1930.5s)]
*  Yeah. She was like, whatever. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1932.3799999999999s)]

*  And it was in like a shopping mall. Oh, yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1947.02s)]
*  Nobody there. That's tough. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1949.3s)]
*  It's tough. And that's tough to bring a girl to a place [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1950.6599999999999s)]
*  that used to be like a radio shack or whatever. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1954.8999999999999s)]
*  Where they do Jiu Jitsu during the day. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1957.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was bad. It was. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1958.86s)]

*  So it was bad. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1962.1399999999999s)]
*  So but I had a pretty decent set for about 15 people in Bohemia, New York [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1963.3799999999999s)]
*  and Suffolk County, Long Island, a pretty decent set. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1967.94s)]

*  Yeah. And she couldn't believe that I did that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1981.7s)]
*  And she was in the back like she was like, I'm not going on stage. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1985.02s)]
*  I was like, I was like, baby, come on stage with me. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=1987.54s)]

*  I have a very culturally diverse fan base. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2014.4199999999998s)]
*  It's like a community college. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2016.9399999999998s)]
*  I was just wondering who would do the whistle. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2018.1s)]

*  Yeah, dude, I put the pressure on it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2033.7s)]
*  I'd be in prison for that today. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2035.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, it's forced and all that. Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2037.1s)]
*  But that was 2014. There were no rules back then. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2038.62s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it was still the wild, wild west. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2041.3799999999999s)]

*  We'll see if she writes a book. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2048.94s)]
*  So so I I I kissed her. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2050.62s)]
*  And then we got back in the car. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2054.06s)]
*  And I was like, was that crazy that I did that? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2055.7s)]

*  It was fully erect. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2327.6600000000003s)]
*  And then it started to go down a little bit because it starts to get nervous while I was going down on her. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2328.54s)]
*  So I just started dry humping my bed. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2332.2200000000003s)]
*  I just started dry humping my bed to make. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2334.3s)]

*  And then it felt like, you know, responsibility. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2347.34s)]
*  Then I was in there and then I had to pee. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2349.5s)]
*  And I knew every time when I, if I masturbate, I had sex with a woman and I hadn't peed. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2352.1400000000003s)]

*  So I'm going to not pull out. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2369.5s)]
*  So I didn't pull out. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2371.1s)]

*  He knows what's going on. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2664.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2666.62s)]
*  Damien was like, just let me listen. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2667.1800000000003s)]
*  Unless you're going to hold my wiener up to keep it hard, bro. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2668.38s)]
*  I don't need you coming up here. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2670.7000000000003s)]

*  Yeah, dude. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2674.06s)]
*  No, Damien knew what was up. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2674.62s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2676.62s)]
*  Nice guy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2677.26s)]
*  So I hadn't even thought of... [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2677.9s)]
*  Because, you know, the birth control, the morning after pill was like an afterthought [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2679.5s)]
*  because it's like, you know, she had taken it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2684.54s)]
*  I was like, nobody's thinking anything. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2685.66s)]
*  I wasn't thinking anything. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2686.78s)]
*  And she didn't... [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2687.74s)]
*  What happened? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2688.22s)]
*  She didn't swallow it? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2688.7s)]
*  No, she did. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2689.74s)]
*  She did. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2690.46s)]
*  So, but she comes on September 11th. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2691.34s)]
*  We were in the hotel room that night and she goes... [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2694.46s)]
*  She... [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2698.06s)]
*  I go to use the bathroom and she says when I come out, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2699.18s)]
*  she has a pregnancy test that's positive. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2704.54s)]
*  And she goes... [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2707.34s)]
*  You did it again? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2708.62s)]
*  She goes, this is your baby. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2709.58s)]
*  She goes, here's the thing. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2711.26s)]
*  She goes, I don't really want to do this. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2712.94s)]
*  I have a son. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2715.18s)]
*  She goes, I told you in the car I was pregnant that birth, the morning after pill didn't work. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2715.9s)]
*  She was like, I told you, I told you. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2720.78s)]
*  She goes, so, you know, you have your career, your life. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2723.34s)]
*  I think you're a nice guy. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2726.06s)]
*  I've had a lovely time with you. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2727.1s)]
*  I would love to even continue to see you. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2728.3s)]
*  She's like, but I'm not going to have another child like this. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2731.02s)]
*  You know, she's like, I already have a child, a son to deal with that. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2734.46s)]
*  I'm not with her. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2737.1s)]
*  His dad. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2737.74s)]
*  What does she mean in Long Island? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2738.06s)]
*  Huh? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2739.3399999999997s)]
*  What does she mean? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2739.98s)]
*  Like have another child on Long Island? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2740.54s)]
*  No, I think she meant like have another child with a guy who maybe doesn't want to get married [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2742.86s)]
*  or maybe like that. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2747.8199999999997s)]
*  Or maybe she did mean I don't want to have a child with a guy who lives in the five boroughs. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2748.62s)]
*  That sounds like a human sewer cap. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2752.54s)]
*  Maybe she said that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2754.46s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2755.58s)]
*  Because her ex, her son's father does sound and look a lot like me. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2756.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, he does? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2760.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2761.5s)]
*  She has white children. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2761.74s)]
*  She's made that very clear. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2762.7s)]
*  She's only going to procreate with white men and that's just her prerogative. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2763.98s)]
*  Yeah. So if you're not white, you can hook up with her, but she will not bury the children. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2767.1s)]
*  That's her. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2772.22s)]
*  That's her words. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2772.7799999999997s)]
*  Not mine. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2773.42s)]
*  Everybody has their own thing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2773.66s)]
*  She said this is like that's what she said. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2775.1s)]
*  She was like, yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2777.5s)]
*  So she was like, I want my kids to have psoriasis. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2778.86s)]
*  So I said, so I said, I said to her, I said to her, you're pregnant, you know, 100% mine. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2782.54s)]
*  She goes, yes, it's 100% yours. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2789.18s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2791.9s)]
*  And I was like, I was like, okay. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2792.7799999999997s)]
*  And then I had that moment in my head where I was like, you know, I'm 30 years old. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2795.26s)]
*  I willingly did this. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2799.42s)]
*  I have my career, you know, where, you know, not where I want it to be. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2800.86s)]
*  But I was like, things seem to go moving in the right direction. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2804.5400000000004s)]
*  I have my education. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2806.46s)]
*  I said, I was irresponsible by acting in the moment and deciding not to pull out and do that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2807.6600000000003s)]
*  Because I was feeling inferior to another. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2812.2200000000003s)]
*  I created all these dumb things in my head because I'm nuts. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2814.0600000000004s)]
*  I said, no, I said to her, I said, look, I said, I would love to have this child, even [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2817.5s)]
*  though I know I barely know you, we don't know anybody. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2822.78s)]
*  You don't know my family. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2825.98s)]
*  I don't know yours. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2826.7000000000003s)]
*  I said, there could be a million red flags for the both of us. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2827.26s)]
*  I was like, but I would love to be a father to this child. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2830.38s)]
*  I was like, I don't know if you and I would work out. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2832.94s)]
*  I don't know if you'll hate me or like me. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2835.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2837.1800000000003s)]
*  I said, but I know for a fact, like I will make this child like my whole life. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2837.5s)]
*  Like, I promise you that will happen. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2840.86s)]
*  It sounds so Japanese all of a sudden. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2842.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2844.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2844.94s)]
*  Well, I dropped a fucking nuke in her. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2845.5s)]
*  So I said, so I said, I said, I will do that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2847.26s)]
*  And she was like, let me think about it. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2851.58s)]
*  Let me think about it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2854.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2856.14s)]
*  My God. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2856.38s)]
*  And then we woke up the next morning. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2857.42s)]
*  This is like on Joe Dirt. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2859.1s)]
*  Whenever that thing happens, he's fucking at the sewer system, whatever. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2860.14s)]
*  And he's drinking shit out of a can. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2863.2599999999998s)]
*  And he's like, and Brandy wouldn't touch my dick. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2865.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, and they left me. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2868.22s)]
*  I said, we'll be right back. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2869.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2872.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2872.2999999999997s)]
*  So she said, so we won't think about it. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2872.54s)]
*  We woke up the next morning. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2874.54s)]
*  We were in Florida in Tampa Bay. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2875.5s)]
*  Woke up the next morning and there was a Pelican on our balcony. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2877.66s)]
*  And I was like, that's a stork. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2880.86s)]
*  I was like, that's a stork, even though I knew it wasn't. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2882.38s)]
*  I was like, that's a stork. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2884.38s)]
*  And because she, you know, she doesn't know there's [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2885.9s)]
*  two Pelicans and storks. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2887.1800000000003s)]
*  She was like, that's a sign then. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2888.94s)]
*  That's a mass stork. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2890.86s)]
*  I said, that's our baby right there. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2893.1s)]
*  That's a stork. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2895.02s)]
*  And she was like, if you're going to be a good dad [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2896.46s)]
*  and you promise me that you'll then we can do it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2898.1400000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2900.86s)]
*  And you did it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2901.42s)]
*  And we did. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2902.1400000000003s)]
*  And that's the best. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2902.54s)]
*  And that's why I now in retrospect, even though I love her and, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2903.1800000000003s)]
*  and you know, she's always been a part of my life. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2907.26s)]
*  I think what I was seeing when I met her that day, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2908.94s)]
*  I placed a beach, I was really seeing my child. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2912.06s)]
*  That's what I was thinking. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2914.86s)]
*  Like a life thing, like it was, cause it was, it was a, it was a, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2915.7400000000002s)]
*  still I've never felt that way about any woman. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2919.1s)]
*  Like while I stopped in my tracks, like this woman is like, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2920.86s)]
*  I felt like this woman's going to be like my life. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2923.34s)]
*  And that's what it turned out. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2925.26s)]
*  Like I'm forever linked to her now. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2926.3s)]
*  We have two children. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2927.66s)]
*  Doesn't matter what happens between us and things are going good between us, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2928.54s)]
*  but it doesn't matter whatever the future holds. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2931.42s)]
*  It's like we we're linked forever. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2933.7400000000002s)]
*  So, and then we broke up, we broke up, like we were co-parenting for years. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2936.54s)]
*  And then the pandemic happened and we got back together. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2942.14s)]
*  First time we had sex, we have now a second daughter, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2944.62s)]
*  my seventh month old daughter, Violet. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2947.5s)]
*  So now, so, so, so it's just locked in like that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2949.66s)]
*  And I think when you're talking about love, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2953.18s)]
*  what I will say is that I feel like now, like I, I never went looking for it like at all. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2955.5s)]
*  It kind of just organically happened. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2963.82s)]
*  And I don't know necessarily what being in love is or what all those, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2966.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it's different things to different people. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2969.9s)]
*  But I know that they'll never be me and Jasmine may not always be together. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2972.06s)]
*  That may or may not happen, but they'll never be a woman. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2976.46s)]
*  Like she will always be priority number one in my life, no matter what, you know? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2979.5s)]
*  And my daughters, of course, you know, my children are my children, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2983.6600000000003s)]
*  but that's a different thing than talk about as a grown adult woman. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2986.06s)]
*  She'll always be priority number one. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2988.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2990.38s)]
*  Like I'd kill my mom, you know, before I killed her. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2990.78s)]
*  Or if I was going to, I'd killed them both at the exact same time. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2993.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2995.82s)]
*  But I never kill my kids, but I would kill my stepson. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2996.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=2999.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3000.78s)]
*  But probably not. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3001.34s)]
*  He'll probably kill me first. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3002.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3004.3s)]
*  Well, I was just kidding. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3004.7s)]
*  I would never kill any of my stepsons or my children. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3005.58s)]
*  No, I don't think I could kill anyone actually. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3007.98s)]
*  I don't think I could kill anyone. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3010.7s)]
*  You could. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3012.7s)]
*  No, because I'm, I am very. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3014.06s)]
*  If something happened, you could, man. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3015.74s)]
*  You know, I don't understand why anyone would spend thousands of dollars on a new website [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3018.54s)]
*  when they don't have to. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3022.86s)]

*  I just received advice. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3175.2599999999998s)]
*  So I have the character on my podcast on the Chrissy K.S. Podcast called TT Jerry. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3176.2999999999997s)]

*  So TT Jerry is, if you guys listen to the Chrissy K.S. Podcast, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3181.42s)]
*  TT Jerry is Jasmine's godfather, whose transgender, who's been in, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3184.86s)]
*  was in prison for 25 years, was son of Sam's prison bitch, as she describes for many years. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3190.7000000000003s)]
*  Also had sex with son of Sam, had sex with the Amityville Massacre, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3196.1400000000003s)]
*  the Amityville Horror House. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3203.34s)]
*  You never heard of that? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3204.6200000000003s)]
*  The Amityville- [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3205.26s)]
*  That's a guy's name Patrick or something? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3205.58s)]
*  No, his name was Ronald DeFeo. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3206.86s)]
*  Oh, Ronald. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3208.94s)]
*  Yeah, TT said that he used to let, she would let him jerk off to her. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3209.98s)]
*  So, you know, she had a knack for killers. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3216.54s)]
*  And so she told me, though, 25 years in prison, she told me recently on the podcast, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3218.94s)]
*  she said, if you went to prison, what I would tell you, if you ever went to prison, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3223.82s)]
*  what you needed to do is immediately say that you're trans. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3229.18s)]
*  You would immediately need to start taking estrogen pills. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3232.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying you have to cut your penis off, but you should take estrogen pills [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3234.3s)]
*  because then they will move you to the transgender part of the prison and you're safe there. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3236.78s)]
*  She said, if you go with the general population men, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3239.98s)]
*  they're going to rape you and kill you probably immediately. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3242.78s)]

*  She knows, look, yeah, I shouldn't say anything. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3266.06s)]
*  But she, but now that she's in our life, you know, she's really helped us, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3268.06s)]

*  She's helped us because she's like, hey, I've actually been in prison. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3273.58s)]
*  I've actually been in solitary confinement. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3276.38s)]
*  Don't make your life a prison when you guys are free. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3278.3s)]
*  Just support each other. You have two beautiful children. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3280.7000000000003s)]

*  So don't do that. So that was a big thing. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3289.34s)]
*  But about the love thing is, is, is I think if you don't look for it, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3291.1s)]
*  I do believe love, you know, this is, this is gay and I love cock when my dad's asleep. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3295.1s)]
*  But what, what it is is if love finds you, you don't find it. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3301.2599999999998s)]
*  I think the people that go looking for it, it's a force thing. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3304.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3307.2599999999998s)]

*  than somebody that's trans, somebody that has a relationship going on inside of their body. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3312.22s)]
*  I was going to say that, that she sees both sides. She comes at it from both sides. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3315.02s)]
*  Dude, why are we not using trans people to help us do marital advice and support? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3318.14s)]
*  Because they are a man and a woman. They, nobody could have sorted out at once than the original [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3324.62s)]
*  recipe. And sometimes the best times with TT Jerry is when sometimes she goes like Minotaur. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3330.2999999999997s)]

*  about love today, I think that, um, I will say this, I will say that having a family, it does [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3513.02s)]
*  make all my problems that I used to complain about seem very minuscule. Like I don't care about, like [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3520.22s)]

*  you outside of your work. Like Japanese people, they are so identified. They are, they have, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3540.46s)]
*  Japanese people have a very, very high suicide rate for people over 65 because when they retire, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3545.42s)]
*  they usually kill themselves because they were just identified by their job. So I identify myself [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3550.94s)]
*  as, you know, a father and then like, then the other stuff is comedy and this and that. But, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3555.42s)]

*  but maybe that is the way to do it. I think some of it is just about just doing it. Like one of my [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3715.1800000000003s)]
*  friends, I'm always like, man, I think I have trouble in relationships and my friends like, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3720.46s)]
*  you have trouble in relationships until you do a relationship. So it's like, you just have to do [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3723.1s)]
*  it. And so that's kind of where I've been at recently. I took a break from dating in, um, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3728.38s)]
*  December. Okay. I took a complete break from dating and interacting with, uh, females. So [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3734.54s)]
*  that kind of helped me get at least a little head space. Cause I would just, I just been kind [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3741.5s)]
*  of frenetic for years, just kind of like one girl to the next. Yeah. You just don't really think of [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3744.78s)]
*  like what's important. You know, you just kind of get used to just messaging and doing this and that. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3749.98s)]
*  And then you're just kind of, I wasn't intentional. Right. So now I'm going to say I'm, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3753.98s)]
*  I'm starting to get to a place where I like to be more intentional. So I just think like, yeah, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3759.74s)]
*  what would be new things in my life? Something that would be new would be being in a loving, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3764.3799999999997s)]
*  committed relationship. Does that woman need to be vaccinated? I do not care if that woman's [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3769.58s)]
*  vaccinated. Okay. So she hasn't approved for a vaccine card. She doesn't have to have the booster. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3774.06s)]
*  No. Okay. That's good because then that widens the playing field. Oh yeah. If you say, I'm only [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3778.94s)]
*  going to have vaccinated women, it's just tough right now, you know, cause I think most of the [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3784.14s)]
*  women that you want to deal with are not vaccinated. Yeah. I'll go non-vaxx. You know, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3789.18s)]
*  cause it's, it's, it's becoming quite clear that it's very difficult to deal with, you know, a very [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3794.46s)]
*  ultra liberal woman. They're very, you want to go Republican. If you're looking for love and a [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3800.54s)]
*  relationship, if you're looking for a one night of fun, then I would say you can go more liberal. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3805.1s)]
*  But if you want to, I mean, a woman who's going to be by your side, then I think you want to go [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3808.8599999999997s)]
*  Republican is what I, is what I would recommend, or at least someone who leans right. They don't [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3812.54s)]
*  have to be ultra right wing nut job, but I would say their priority should be to the right because [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3816.86s)]
*  it's becoming clear that the, you know, the people to the left is just, it's a losing battle. You [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3821.5s)]
*  know, well, some of it over there is getting weird. I mean, whenever you get way out on the fringe, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3825.6600000000003s)]
*  it gets really weird, but that's one of the reasons why I got a place in Nashville during the [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3829.6600000000003s)]
*  spandex. It was like, it was normal there. Like there was no, nobody was masking. Nobody's doing [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3834.1400000000003s)]
*  like, it was normal and it's been fine. It's fine. So that was like, you know, Rogan asked me, why [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3840.46s)]
*  did you move there? And I couldn't, I mean, taxes are, you know, there's no state taxes and stuff [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3846.22s)]
*  in here. You know, they might even move them up to 18% in California, but I know New York and [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3850.3799999999997s)]
*  California, the worst, but then also there's a lot of great things about living in those places. So [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3854.9399999999996s)]
*  it's like, you get it. Yeah. You don't want to, you know, but yeah, I would say, I would say if [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3859.02s)]
*  you're looking for love, but it was just free there, you know, I was like, Oh, I want to live [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3864.2999999999997s)]
*  in a place that was free. And it felt strange when I came to other places and like, you know, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3867.66s)]
*  I would try for you, man, if I'm being honest with you, just like, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3872.54s)]
*  just vibing as a, as a pretty, my friends to be honest with me as a pretty mature guy, like, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3876.9399999999996s)]
*  you know, or the most, you do as the most mature in my life and being a father and just being [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3881.8999999999996s)]
*  knowing what I think, just being truthful is for me, man, when I look at you, I think you would, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3887.66s)]
*  you want a right leaning woman who's from Wyoming. I think you want to stay like a Wyoming or an [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3891.3399999999997s)]
*  Idaho. You want someone like that. You don't want, you don't want someone who's in entertainment, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3897.2599999999998s)]
*  you know, you don't want someone, you don't want someone who's storming the Capitol. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3901.9s)]
*  I think you'd like a nice, just like, like, like watch that show Yellowstone and a woman like that [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3905.58s)]
*  is what you want. Maybe some, maybe you could contact Kevin Costner and see if there's an [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3910.62s)]
*  extra or something like that who's single and available in Montana. I think that would work [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3913.6600000000003s)]
*  for you, man. I could see you with that because you're- And they're tall too and wind burn. A [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3917.42s)]

*  lot of the stuff that you like to eat, like ferret and whatever other, you know, cause it's from [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=3926.2200000000003s)]

*  I, yeah, I think, well, there's a lot of identifying people that want to be just a, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4049.26s)]
*  you know, they want to be something and they, I think a lot of people out of fear too, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4053.7400000000002s)]
*  their boss is a certain thing and they feel like they have to be that. Right. But it's funny when [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4057.42s)]
*  we're talking about 2015 and even before that, it's like, I don't think people care. It's so crazy [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4062.46s)]

*  but when you really think that you let some political thing divide you from your own family [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4072.54s)]
*  members and a lot of it's just things you heard or, you know, it's like, it's not like real shit [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4078.7s)]
*  between you and them. It's just like pieces that you both heard on social media and stuff and just [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4083.98s)]
*  fuel. It's kind of crazy. You know, my father said this in 2008, 2009, you know, this is a man with [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4088.94s)]
*  an eighth grade education, but very street smart. And as you could, you know, you know, as a special [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4093.98s)]
*  needs man. And he was saying that he said in 2009, he said this, this Twitter thing is going to be [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4097.82s)]
*  the worst thing that ever happened for this country. And I was like, why? He's like, because [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4103.34s)]
*  not everyone's supposed to be talking and it's come out to be true. Social media is like, not [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4106.0599999999995s)]
*  everyone's supposed to have an opinion. This is not, this is not what it is. He's like, you can't [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4110.86s)]
*  let the whole world talk. And I'm like, it's pretty true because now you get people galvanized, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4114.54s)]
*  little sections of them. And then they do big things where it used to be, you know, these people's [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4119.74s)]
*  ideas were just, they would get shot down at a, you know, at a cafeteria in Biloxi. It wouldn't [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4123.58s)]
*  go any further than that. But now it's like that cafeteria in Biloxi, you know, you can get that [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4127.82s)]
*  to thousands, millions, billions of people. So it's problematic. But I think we're, I think we're [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4131.58s)]
*  going back in the right direction. I think, I think, I think we're going to be all right, man. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4135.9s)]
*  I think once Biden dies of natural causes, it's going to be all right. You know, cause I think [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4140.54s)]
*  they're going to have to push him. They're going to have to do something with him. You know, I don't [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4144.54s)]
*  want him to die. I think he's okay. It's like watching old Yeller. It's like watching old Yeller. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4147.98s)]
*  Yeah. I think, I think that the United States is like, I don't think, I think that the powers that [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4152.06s)]
*  be are going to, they're going to say, you know, they might just get Lee Harvey Oswald back, back, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4156.38s)]
*  you know, it might get the juices flowing again. Oh, to assassinate it would be easy. Just, you know, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4160.700000000001s)]
*  it'd be, you just don't, you just, you just don't give him his pills that morning. It's just, I [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4165.580000000001s)]
*  don't know. But also government has become such a, that's not even our government anymore. Facebook [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4170.620000000001s)]
*  is our government. Twitter is our government. Like those are the things, the ruling entities. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4175.18s)]
*  The rest of this is just bull. It's like trial by Twitter. It's, it's people just arguing about [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4179.74s)]
*  some bullshit. Well, it's become states rights. That's why when you, you know, you live in a place [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4184.139999999999s)]
*  like Tennessee or Florida, you live a different life than you do other places. Like I've never [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4187.98s)]
*  thought I would ever want to even consider leaving New York. But this, there's a very simple thing. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4193.82s)]
*  Like in New York, my six year old has to wear masks in her classroom all day. She hates it. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4198.139999999999s)]
*  I hate it for her. I hate it for her social people. I'm not worried. The breathing is like whatever, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4203.0199999999995s)]
*  you can't deny it. Like when my child doesn't see her friends, when you see someone's full face, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4207.820000000001s)]
*  you get, you know, her brain is forming. She could see people smiling. She doesn't understand [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4212.22s)]

*  South in Florida, she's living a free life. Like it's 2019. So you're getting there in your career [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4220.38s)]
*  where you can do that. It's make, I make, I have to make like an honest decision. If in the summer, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4225.1s)]
*  the summer, they're like, Hey, we're going mass on again. Then I'll, I don't want her to live like [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4228.9400000000005s)]
*  that. And I'm not anti-vax or anti-science. I'm not a right-wing nut. I kid around, but like, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4233.5s)]
*  seriously, I'm like, that's a simple thing. That's a very easy thing for me as a pair where like, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4237.82s)]
*  I just don't want my child wearing a mask anymore. I don't. Well, I just, I think the whole thing's [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4242.14s)]
*  interesting how none of the so like none of the social effects of this have come into any [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4246.38s)]
*  conversation. There was never any big conversation. The fact that if we shut everything down, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4252.22s)]
*  we're going to have hundreds of thousands of people that are going to die from addiction, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4257.02s)]
*  from loneliness. All the people that probably seniors that died of heartbreak because they [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4262.62s)]
*  couldn't see their fucking family. It's like, and that a lot of that stuff is unquantifiable. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4267.9s)]
*  And I bet I really believe that it could be more than the amount of people that died from COVID in [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4272.62s)]
*  America anyway. I really believe it just because for me, you know, it's my own thing. I have six [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4279.34s)]
*  friends that overdosed and died during the pandemic, completely dead, gone off the earth. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4283.66s)]
*  Right. I don't have, I don't know anybody that died of COVID. That's just me. It's my own world. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4288.0599999999995s)]
*  But if they had AA meetings that were open and recovery houses that were open, it might not have [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4293.339999999999s)]
*  been the same case for some people. So I don't know. I might have a different chip on my shoulder. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4299.74s)]
*  It's a mental health issue. Like in New York, I saw the other day, I saw a guy in the middle of [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4304.86s)]
*  the day. Uh, it's like a homeless man. And he started, uh, like I saw this full, he started [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4310.219999999999s)]
*  like a full spray shitting, like diarrhea on a brick wall, right, right near Penn station in [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4315.82s)]
*  New York city by Mass Square Garden. Like just full shitting on a brick wall. Yeah. Like it was [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4321.42s)]
*  crazy, dude. Like wild, wild behavior. Like just nuts. When people are desperate, when you're [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4325.58s)]
*  spraying your something out of your body onto a wall to like, yeah, get a message across that's [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4330.78s)]
*  desperation. Spray shit. And a woman was walking by and I saw, cause I was stopped. I was like, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4335.9s)]
*  Oh my God, and a woman was walking by and she called him gay or something. No, she walked up [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4340.62s)]
*  to him and she goes, she called me gay for no reason. And she goes, and she walked up to him [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4344.46s)]
*  and she goes, she goes, excuse me, sir, put on a mask. And I was like, I mean, this guy's spray [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4348.94s)]
*  shitting against a wall and you're worried about his COVID status. Like, you know, like it's just [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4354.38s)]
*  like we're outdoors in public. Let them, you know, it's a mental health issue. Like the people who [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4358.46s)]
*  are the most afraid have all three vaccine shots, probably two boosters, they wear six masks and [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4362.62s)]
*  they're the ones that are terrified. And I'm like, it's a mental health issue. It's clear. It's a [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4368.78s)]
*  mental health issue now. You know? Yeah. It's interesting, man. Well, it's just the mental [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4372.86s)]
*  health side of it is really interesting. And a lot of that hasn't really been explored and it'll all [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4377.74s)]
*  be looked at probably years down the road. But the thing is I think Dr. Fauci is like, just like cute. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4381.259999999999s)]

*  Yeah, man. Like he looks like if a tortellini became a national health doctor, you know, like, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4404.54s)]
*  I like him, man. But he lost him when he threw out that pitch at the national game. Yeah. He stinks [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4409.58s)]
*  at baseball, which is crazy because a lot of those Italian guys who grew up in Brooklyn, they play [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4413.58s)]
*  stick ball and Joe DiMaggio. Yeah, dude. So he's, he's, he's, uh, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4418.06s)]

*  man. Yeah. And he did it for a girl that didn't want to uncircumcise. Just pierce your ears. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4438.46s)]
*  That's what I said. And then she dumped it about two weeks later, fucked his dick up, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4444.54s)]
*  man. His dick was swollen. It was bad, dude. You ever pierce your own ears for a woman? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4447.66s)]
*  Pierce my own ears for a woman? No. I mean, the craziest thing I did is I got a woman pregnant [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4453.9s)]
*  because I felt inferior to her ex and I started a full life. I locked myself into, in woman for the [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4458.38s)]
*  rest of my life just to get even with a guy I just saw once on Instagram. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4465.42s)]

*  then yeah, dude, I'm going to take a chance on a joke. I'm going to add a show that I probably [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4501.9s)]
*  shouldn't have added. I want to make a ticket price. I don't give a fuck. Go for a new America, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4506.78s)]

*  them just to like stand out? You know what I mean? No, don't do that. Or like try to, or like kill [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4543.740000000001s)]
*  one of the security guards or something. No, I think he'll. And bring his head in like on a spike [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4548.3s)]
*  and be like, yo, start the show. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4552.46s)]
*  It is puppet. We are live. Yeah. But dude, you're killing. I mean, what else is going on? The thing [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4556.94s)]

*  Oh, wow. I said, I said, if Theo's ever in New York, I'm sure if he's got the time, man, we'll [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4582.38s)]
*  take a walk. I had so much fun on there. I was really cutting my own hair for about eight years. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4586.3s)]
*  And I'm down there. I remember that we had that back and forth where I said, you look like Eileen [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4590.54s)]
*  Wernos. You said I look like a deaf guy that goes to the gym. Yeah. It was good back and forth. And [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4594.06s)]

*  he died of a blood clot. And this was about April, I think of 2020, where he might've been early [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4614.3s)]
*  COVID, you know, cause they were saying that COVID was causing blood clots or it might've just been [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4619.02s)]
*  a risk. Vic had gotten hit by a car a few days before and wouldn't go to the doctor. And Opie was [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4622.38s)]
*  like, you need to go to the doctor. Did you got hit by a car, man? And he was like, I ain't going, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4627.74s)]
*  I ain't going to the doctor. So there might've been a blood clot forming in his body. I mean, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4631.66s)]
*  got fully hit by a car. That'll clot your blood. If you get hit by a fucking vehicle, dude, if, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4634.46s)]
*  if anything's gonna clot your blood, it'd be that. That's a crazy thing, man. To get hit by a car. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4638.54s)]
*  I remember, uh, trying to steal my mom's car one time. And then like it started, I was pushing, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4643.34s)]

*  one time I was driving, me and my dad, I was in my dad's Oldsmobile and all four of his doors opened [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4669.18s)]
*  up on the Varizano bridge, going to Staten Island. All four of the doors at the same time. It was [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4674.78s)]
*  wild. And I didn't have a seatbelt on. I was like 11. My dad was just holding me. My sister fell [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4679.58s)]

*  What else were we talking about? No, dude, we're just flowing, man. I felt like this, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4704.86s)]
*  this, you came out me and we were, we just started talking about love, which I could talk about it [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4709.0199999999995s)]
*  all day because I think it's got many different definitions, dude. And I don't know if all your [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4712.94s)]
*  fans will like this. Maybe some of them tuned out, but the ones that stayed, man, congratulations, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4716.78s)]
*  because, you know, it's a different vibe. We're not just going to talk about jokes all the time. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4720.78s)]
*  We're talking about love. Well, yeah. I think a lot of people want to hear that. Oh, I think, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4725.5s)]
*  I mean, it's just what I've kind of been like, not thinking about, but it's like, you know, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4730.379999999999s)]

*  See, because I had children first, I don't want to get married. If I would have gotten married [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4753.34s)]
*  and they have the kids, that's one thing, but because I had the kids first, I don't see, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4758.62s)]
*  to me, what I think of is marriage is, this is my opinion, marriage is a piece of paper. It feels [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4762.62s)]
*  archaic. It feels like something you would do. Like if you're very wealthy, like if you're on [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4768.54s)]
*  that show, Succession, then you get married because it's power dynamics. But this marriage [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4771.66s)]
*  thing now is just a piece of paper that some guy made up that had to be a thing. It's not real, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4776.86s)]
*  but children, like that's a type of marriage from the universe. I can't explain. I'm forever locked [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4781.82s)]
*  in to my children's mother now. And that's not, that's from some, that's from God, that's from [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4786.62s)]
*  some powers I don't understand. But the piece of paper is like, that's just whatever state you [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4791.74s)]
*  live in, there's different rules. You got to pay a guy. That's how I look at it. And some people [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4795.9s)]
*  will say, oh, that's a bullshit way of looking at your, you know, that ain't cool. But I'm like, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4799.34s)]
*  that, but that's how I feel. That's heaven's eggs, dude. That's children. I would like to have, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4803.42s)]
*  I think then some matrimony. I think I would like to then maybe just, even if I co-parent it or [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4808.38s)]
*  something, have like a loving environment that brought some children into the world. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4812.62s)]
*  I will say having children, man, it's the most beautiful thing. Listen, it's all ego. The thing [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4816.3s)]
*  is it all stems from, it all stems from a degree of narcissism, that everything, you know, even [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4822.14s)]
*  mothers love it. You know, the reason why you love your own children is because it's a piece of you. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4827.9s)]
*  Right? So, so that's okay to, I think, to accept that. You know, you can't put yourself before [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4831.42s)]
*  your kids because you need to, you need to make sure you're healthy and strong so you can be [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4837.42s)]
*  healthy and strong for your children. You know what I mean? Like, like, so, so when some people are [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4841.9s)]
*  like, oh, my kids are everything. My kids are everything to me. They truly are. But I have to [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4845.9s)]
*  be mentally and physically happy and healthy so I can pass it on to them. So I'm always think, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4849.58s)]
*  every decision I make, I'm thinking about that. You know? Yeah. See, I like that. I think I would [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4853.58s)]
*  like to just have something and I don't want, I don't want to do it because of that, but it would [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4857.66s)]
*  be nice to have something in the world that makes me less self-focused. Yes, because I think that's [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4861.66s)]
*  the only way that it popped like that, you know, I can get outside of my own thoughts and ego is to, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4868.94s)]
*  because I can't, you know, I can't sit there and commiserate all day about career or about something [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4875.18s)]
*  I said five years ago or about what are people saying about me on social media. I can't commiserate [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4880.86s)]
*  about that because my daughter needs to eat, you know? And I'm like, this is the real important [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4885.26s)]
*  stuff. Even like, you know, on the social medias of the world, you realize like all you have to do [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4889.9800000000005s)]
*  is like, you know, when, I don't know, somebody, you know, gets canceled or somebody gets a bad [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4894.38s)]
*  review on a show, like all you have to do is delete that app and then it's gone. Because the real world [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4898.9400000000005s)]
*  for me is my children. As long as my children think I'm okay, I don't care what anybody thinks of me. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4904.62s)]
*  So it's a, it's like a superpower where sometimes people will be like, wow, Chris, you say some crazy [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4909.1s)]
*  shit sometimes on stage. Like you ever get worried about being canceled? I'm like, no, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4913.58s)]
*  because I got my kids, man. And if you find you've taken my comedy career away, I mean, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4917.66s)]
*  I'll just go be a physical therapist. I have a license. Like I don't want, I love doing comedy. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4921.74s)]
*  I love this. I want this to be my life. Yeah, but why not stretch a guy's leg out somewhere? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4925.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? I might do both, dude. As a matter of fact, when the pandemic happened, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4930.3s)]
*  Governor Cuomo of New York, former Governor Cuomo of New York, he reinstated every healthcare [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4934.14s)]

*  license because you like killed somebody, but mine had just lapsed. As a matter of fact, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4942.94s)]

*  physical therapy license on, on a five year hiatus, because that's only designed for pregnant women, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4958.0599999999995s)]
*  for women who had had children and want to step away and raise their kids and then come back. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4964.0599999999995s)]
*  I was the only male on that. So there was all these people that I was in the pregnancy base. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4967.58s)]
*  I was basically the pregnancy, you know, part of the, you know, portion of the license. I, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4972.22s)]
*  my license was treated like, as if I was a pregnant woman that had bore children. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4977.34s)]
*  So I, so I got my license reinstated like that, like overnight in an email, I got my full license. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJj6cegcmk&t=4980.9400000000005s)]
