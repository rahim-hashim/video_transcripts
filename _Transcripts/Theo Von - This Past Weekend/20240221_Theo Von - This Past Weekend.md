*  Parking attendants are always on some shit. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=89.36s)]
*  Oh, parking attendants because you have to think one of the things that they, one of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=91.12s)]
*  the things that the parking attendants deal with a lot is boredom probably and potential, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=95.64s)]
*  I don't want to say, I would start more beef if I was them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=101.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=108.44s)]
*  The shit in LA is so funny. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=109.44s)]
*  It's like if you're here for 15 minutes, it's $17. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=110.92s)]
*  How are you getting that math? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=113.64s)]

*  Dude, a lot of the behavior from parking attendants, you can tell that they, some of them have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  never driven a vehicle. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=125.84s)]
*  Yeah, they don't have a car there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=126.84s)]

*  They get dropped off. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=130.84s)]
*  The prices are arbitrary. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=131.84s)]
*  It almost depends on how angry their wife was at them that morning as to how much you're [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=132.84s)]
*  going to have to pay. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=136.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=137.68s)]
*  That's how I feel a lot of times, dude. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=138.68s)]
*  And that guy, cause you and I, you and I had the same location for our podcast. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=140.51999999999998s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=146.12s)]
*  That got the parking attendant, we would find him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=147.56s)]
*  He started wearing no shoes in the bathroom. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=152.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=155.56s)]
*  It must be more freeing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=156.56s)]
*  I mean, he was there so much, it probably felt like home for him, you know? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=157.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=159.84s)]
*  Somebody taking a shit and kicking your shoes off, you know, it's kind of like, it's like [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=160.84s)]
*  a white flag. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=163.84s)]
*  It's like a tree tree, you know? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=164.84s)]
*  But yeah, I'm done. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=166.56s)]
*  Like my wife wins, you know? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=168.56s)]

*  You're about to be there for 25 minutes at least. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=174.56s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=175.56s)]
*  I'm going to do shit if we're talking about it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=178.0s)]
*  I got to talk in. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=179.0s)]
*  And also your office is three feet by four feet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=181.28s)]
*  Your office is a standing up coffin. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=186.0s)]
*  When you die, they just tilt over the toll booth and just put it on the side and like, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=187.8s)]
*  hey, it's buried right there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=192.28s)]
*  Dude, your office, that's a crazy thing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=193.84s)]
*  Your office, you can't even turn around in your office. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=196.2s)]
*  Like you have to walk out sideways out of your office. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=199.2s)]
*  It's kind of nice though. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=201.8s)]
*  He's got like a porch, which is the parking lot. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=202.8s)]
*  Well, he also had what the craziest thing that guy had was he had an air conditioning [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=206.68s)]
*  unit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=209.84s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=210.84s)]
*  On the side of the. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=211.84s)]
*  That's bigger than the whole unit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=212.84s)]
*  It was a porta potty with like an air conditioning unit on the side. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=214.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=216.96s)]
*  And he would blast that bitch, man. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=217.96s)]
*  He would be in there just getting frosty, bro. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=219.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's fun, man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=222.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's quite a job, man. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=223.92000000000002s)]

*  That's where we did that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=229.6s)]
*  What other podcasts were in there, I wonder? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Was there other ones? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=233.12s)]
*  H3. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=234.12s)]
*  H3 used to be in there? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=235.6s)]
*  H3 was in the same building. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=236.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=237.6s)]

*  Fucking legendary. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=239.6s)]
*  So that place has a little bit of history to it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=240.6s)]
*  There's some other shit going on over there, too. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=242.6s)]
*  I always see couples who are fighting coming down the halls. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=244.6s)]
*  So maybe there's like a couple's therapy in there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=246.6s)]
*  There's a, it's like that Jerry Springer outpost or whatever, like where you get tests [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=249.6s)]
*  or whatever that thing is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=254.6s)]
*  Wait, they have a Jerry Springer outpost in there? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=255.6s)]
*  Dude, look at it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=257.6s)]

*  I'm trying to think, because H3 moved out of there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  Rogan's moved at least twice. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=282.08000000000004s)]

*  First of all, I did. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2138.64s)]
*  I went there and had to take Spanish right in all the kids in their college. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2139.64s)]
*  And this was in high school. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2143.64s)]
*  All the kids in there were Mexican. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2145.64s)]

*  And and I was the only one paying attention. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2153.64s)]
*  It's just like me and the teacher just having a one on one. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2156.64s)]
*  I was the only white dude they would have like gang things would happen at lunch. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2159.64s)]
*  They have to have the alarm go off. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2164.64s)]
*  You have to lay down and like just eat your sandwich. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2165.64s)]
*  Lay it down. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2168.64s)]
*  Yeah, just like that. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2169.64s)]

*  And you have to lay down and eat your burger. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2178.64s)]
*  And then the for real fucking vatos las violencias. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2180.64s)]
*  They would have fights in the car wash after school. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2186.64s)]
*  And after like a certain amount that got somebody would break them out the thing and just spray it down and then be the end of the fight. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2191.64s)]
*  That's pretty cool, dude. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2197.64s)]
*  It's kind of a bit of tradition. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2198.64s)]
*  It's almost like being at the rodeo kind of, you know. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2200.64s)]
*  It's fun. You get to like leave there with a shower. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2202.64s)]
*  So you hear ASPY ready to party. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2204.64s)]
*  And sometimes you see the rainbow in the mist. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2206.64s)]
*  And then you like get your hair blow-dried at the end. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2208.64s)]
*  My Spanish teacher, she had a really soft voice. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2210.64s)]
*  So she would talk with a speaker box attached to her hip. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2213.64s)]
*  And she had like a microphone like plug. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2216.64s)]
*  She had a microphone and it would project her voice. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2218.64s)]
*  And I used to take my dad's. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2221.64s)]
*  My dad had hip surgery and he got prescribed Vicodin and he was allergic to him. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2222.64s)]
*  So he didn't take him. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2226.64s)]
*  So I would just sneak a Vicodin every once in a while before Spanish class. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2227.64s)]
*  So I would just be fucking biked out listening to Ricky Martin 2.0 just blasting away, dude. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2231.64s)]

*  I have like vivid memories of her class, 9 a.m. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2242.64s)]
*  And I would smoke before class sometimes. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2246.64s)]
*  And I didn't know Spanish at all. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2248.64s)]
*  So just being high off a percset hearing Spanish, I was like, I think this is like how Duolingo was invented. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2249.64s)]

*  So all the Spanish they taught us was like about fucking funeralists and like fucking coyotes and all kind of. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2268.64s)]

*  She was under fire in 2014, accused of misidentifying herself as black while serving as the head of the NAACP. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2477.64s)]
*  Look, first of all, if someone wants to do a job and do it well, I don't think you should not let them do it because of their ethnicity. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2483.64s)]
*  That goes against what the whole program is even trying to say, it feels like. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2491.64s)]
*  But what else happened to her? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2495.64s)]

*  Yeah, we only learned of Miss Nkechi Diallo. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2519.64s)]
*  Everybody knows who that is though. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2523.64s)]
*  Like she'd walk in class and be like, oh, Miss Diallo, that's Rachel Dollaz though. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2524.64s)]
*  Also, like, just do OnlyFans. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2529.64s)]
*  You don't need to be a teacher. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2531.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2533.64s)]
*  But I think you have to get, this is messed up, but where are you going to get your clientele? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2534.64s)]
*  If you don't go to school looking hot. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2541.64s)]
*  Bro, no way. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2543.64s)]
*  You don't go to, if you had your hot teacher, you telling me if she had an OnlyFans. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2544.64s)]
*  Miss Safran, yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2549.64s)]
*  Miss Safran. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2550.64s)]
*  And you could go home after school or even be sitting in class looking at her teaching. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2551.64s)]
*  And then you look on your phone. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2556.64s)]
*  She has like a QR code on like her shirt or something. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2558.64s)]
*  I think if I was a substitute teacher, that's how I'd recruit. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2560.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2563.64s)]
*  You know, just be like, oh, here's what you do. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2564.64s)]
*  You go to pull up a presentation and then it's accidentally on your OnlyFans page. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2566.64s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm so sorry. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2569.64s)]
*  And then you see all the kids snap it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2570.64s)]
*  I mean, maybe that is a better way because now that this story is out, her OnlyFans is only going to get higher. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2573.64s)]
*  So maybe you get fired as this is all PR. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2578.64s)]
*  I support her, man. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2581.64s)]
*  I would, I want to be interesting to talk to because Diallo has a public social media page where she has linked an OnlyFans page. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2582.64s)]
*  It doesn't say what school she was at. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2591.64s)]
*  Catalina Foothills. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2594.64s)]

*  Well, here's part of the problem is we're not paying the teachers. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2602.64s)]
*  No. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2604.64s)]
*  So what are you expecting to do? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2605.64s)]
*  I don't think like it's crazy that your teacher, right? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2607.64s)]
*  The person who's helping guide your child. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2611.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2635.64s)]
*  They should be firing the whatever they're and whoever chooses the salaries for the school people. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2636.64s)]
*  I did always like when the teachers like would spend their own money and like let the class know they would always let the kids know and be like, this was out of Miss Eckertson's budget. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2642.64s)]
*  You know, I went to Target myself on Sunday and bought these markers. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2649.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2914.64s)]
*  Let's just see how he's doing. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2915.64s)]
*  If he's still competing. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2916.64s)]
*  He's doing only fans too. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2918.64s)]
*  Yeah, but that's where it's at now. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2920.64s)]
*  It's sad, you know, but then I guess it's like you're in competition. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2923.64s)]
*  You're in control of it. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2926.64s)]
*  So maybe it's not sad. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2928.64s)]
*  Maybe my view of it is sad. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2929.64s)]
*  Do you think it's sad or do you think it's OK? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2931.64s)]
*  Maybe you're right. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2933.64s)]
*  Maybe we put this negative connotation on it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2934.64s)]
*  Like if my teacher has an awesome body or a body that I want to see, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2936.64s)]
*  or she like showing it off and twerking or whatever. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2941.64s)]
*  I think we've passed the point. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2943.64s)]
*  Maybe in the beginning it might have been a little sad, but I think everybody has. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2945.64s)]
*  Even growing up, one of my friends, this kid Peter, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2948.64s)]
*  had a photo of his mom naked in the house. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2951.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2953.64s)]
*  It was like, you know, that was free only fans back then because we would see that. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2954.64s)]
*  And I still can remember that like visual, but she's doing that for free. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2959.64s)]
*  Just like imagine one day we all go to his house for sleepover and she accidentally is like, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2962.64s)]
*  oops, I left this website open. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2966.64s)]

*  And I were signing up for it. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2970.64s)]
*  I think everybody's mom has been naked in a photo somewhere. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2972.64s)]
*  So you might as well monetize it. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2975.64s)]
*  Yeah, as long as it doesn't interrupt with like what your. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2977.64s)]
*  I don't know. I don't see a problem with it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2981.64s)]
*  There's this cooking couple and they cook and then this is on Pornhub. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2983.64s)]
*  This is legitimate. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2988.64s)]
*  So wait, this these people were from your hometown. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=2989.64s)]

*  Yeah, you know, I kind of I don't think that it's. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3002.64s)]
*  Wrong, you know, if people were going to do what they want to do, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3007.64s)]
*  I think it might be a little strange. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3010.64s)]
*  Here's the strange part is if kids can go and see you doing something that's pretty pretty graphic, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3012.64s)]
*  that ain't good for kids. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3019.64s)]

*  He like threw a wad of soap and toilet paper to the ceiling. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3060.64s)]
*  And then everybody heard about it at lunch. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3063.64s)]
*  That was viral. Like, damn, Ricky wadded up the science, bro. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3065.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. What a legend, dude. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3069.64s)]
*  It was easy to be a legend back then. Oh, so easy to be a legend. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3072.64s)]
*  You could do anything. These dumb high school pranks. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3075.64s)]
*  We take ketchup packets and we put them under the toilet seat. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3077.64s)]
*  So when somebody would go to sit down and shoot at them, I would kill myself. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3079.64s)]
*  If I was at lunch or if I was trying to pee in between Spanish class, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3087.64s)]
*  I'm off a bike it in and I get shot by Heinz 57 in the kneecaps. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3092.64s)]
*  I'm taking my own life. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3097.64s)]
*  Bro, there's nothing gayer for some reason than the back of your leg, dude. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3099.64s)]
*  When you walk into class and somebody's like, do you, something like ketchup? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3105.64s)]
*  I'm like, I gotta end it here. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3108.64s)]
*  But really, even when you just touch the back of your leg, it feels like it does. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3109.64s)]
*  It feels like you could fuck it. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3112.64s)]
*  It feels like it's been fucking meeting guys somewhere. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3114.64s)]
*  It's been waiting for it. But imagine trying to wipe that off. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3117.64s)]
*  It feels like veal kind of doesn't it? It feels more expensive. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3121.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. A little tender. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3125.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude, if you touch the back of your legs, man, it just feels more expensive. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3127.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's maybe what that's the part that I think if I had a casket, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3130.64s)]
*  the open casket that had cremation, I'd have that down there. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3133.64s)]
*  Like bone marrow type thing. Oh, yeah. I like that. Like a dip. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3137.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I love that. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3140.64s)]
*  Your open casket definitely chips and everything around you. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3142.64s)]
*  Yeah. Because you don't want people to have to come up and feel like they can't stay and look at you. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3146.64s)]
*  That's the thing that I did hate sometimes. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3149.64s)]
*  Like it was horrible to see somebody sometimes open casket, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3151.64s)]
*  but you felt like you only got like two seconds and then it wasn't cool of you. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3154.64s)]
*  And you had to go back and cry like by the chairs and stuff. Yeah. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3160.64s)]
*  Because, yeah, some people you want to get back in line, you know. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3165.64s)]
*  Oh, that's true. That's true. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3168.64s)]
*  I would maybe do like sunglasses or like, I don't know. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3170.64s)]
*  Yeah. But deaf put a perk 30 on somebody if you go to their open casket. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3174.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do something. Put it right on their lapel or something. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3179.64s)]
*  Put it in dad's hand. Give him something. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3181.64s)]

*  Bro, you know what the craziest in high school were those people that came and did the anti-drug performances? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3319.64s)]
*  That or the DUI guy? Do you have a DUI guy? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3328.64s)]
*  Yeah, we had this dude, Maestro Mack was his name, right? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3331.64s)]
*  He's on Pornhub. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3337.64s)]
*  He taught something at our school, right? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3339.64s)]
*  And suddenly he showed up one day and he was just in like wrestling, like shorts or a unitard or something. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3341.64s)]
*  And he would say like, karate my body! [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3350.64s)]
*  And then he would just break a fucking brick or something with his hand, right? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3355.64s)]
*  And everybody's like, is this anti-drug? Because this makes me want to do coke. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3358.64s)]
*  This makes me want to do drugs. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3362.64s)]
*  Dude, the craziest part was too, like one time he had like a bunch of wood or whatever, right? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3364.64s)]
*  That he was going to break, you know? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3373.64s)]
*  And the shop teacher would always get pissed because he'd be like, he'd be jealous that he had all this spare wood. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3375.64s)]
*  He'd be like, we're fucking, we have nothing. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3380.64s)]
*  He's building out of mechanical pencils over here. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3383.64s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3385.64s)]
*  It was crazy, bro, because the shop teachers, they would always steal like these wooden like parts by the baseball field that had advertisements on them. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3386.64s)]
*  And then you'd see like bird houses like a month later and they would, they'd all have like auto glass or something on the side of it. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3393.64s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3401.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Made in Stockton. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3402.64s)]
*  But that dude, one time Maestro Mack, yeah, people were like, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3404.64s)]
*  It was like 9 a.m. too. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3410.64s)]
*  It was like you'd get to class and they'd be like, oh, we're not doing class today. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3411.64s)]
*  We're learning about an assembly. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3414.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing assembly and it's about no drugs. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3416.64s)]
*  And this guy, his wife would go out and light like two smoke bombs or whatever in the gym. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3418.64s)]
*  And then he would like come running out in between them. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3423.64s)]
*  It was so bizarre. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3425.64s)]
*  And then like the finale one time, he, she was hitting him in the head with a broomstick, right? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3427.64s)]
*  Like right to break it across his head. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3434.64s)]
*  And she hit him like three times. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3437.64s)]
*  And it didn't break. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3440.64s)]
*  And everybody could see the cops start to kind of walk over a little bit like the security guards and shit. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3441.64s)]
*  And people started yelling one more time. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3447.64s)]
*  It starts in a WWE. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3450.64s)]
*  Dana White's in there like, you better fuck him up, man. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3452.64s)]
*  So this is to prevent drugs? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3455.64s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3457.64s)]
*  I was like, and then she hit him three more times. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3458.64s)]
*  He was just bleeding everywhere. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3461.64s)]
*  And they, and then they shut it down. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3462.64s)]
*  Dude, the best drug prevention should just be a guy who's really coked out trying to pitch on starting a podcast for like an hour. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3464.64s)]
*  And he just doesn't stop talking to the whole auditorium. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3470.64s)]
*  So you don't get a man, Bluetooth, VPN, plug talk. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3473.64s)]
*  And he just keeps going about it. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3475.64s)]
*  I would never do it. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3477.64s)]
*  Yeah, we had a DUI one and they would make us put on these like goggles that made it feel like you were drunk. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3478.64s)]
*  And then we get in a drive simulator. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3483.64s)]
*  I got pretty good at it. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3486.64s)]
*  Because it just made me want to be like, how good is this? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3489.64s)]
*  Because they had to test it somewhere. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3492.64s)]
*  I'm like, they just riffing this on a laboratory somewhere or they're sending out Thomas who's hammered off a couple of steel reserves. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3493.64s)]
*  Go drive the Bronco around the block and see what you get into. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3500.64s)]
*  And so wait, it was like an Oculus type of thing. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3504.64s)]
*  So it was, yeah, it looked like an Oculus, but it was like, look it up, Nick, like lab coat, like plastic glasses. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3507.64s)]
*  But the vision, it just looked like like maybe glasses that your dad would wear. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3513.64s)]
*  They're really thick, like, but they were just really bad eyesight that just blurred everything. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3516.64s)]
*  So I was having like drunk driver simulator, like goggles. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3520.64s)]
*  Yeah, they just look like that. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3524.64s)]
*  But they like, yeah, they just made you see really blurry. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3526.64s)]
*  But it was like kind of fun to do it like 9 a.m. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3530.64s)]
*  All the football players like this is how I drive to practice. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3533.64s)]
*  Fatal vision impairment goggles. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3537.64s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3540.64s)]
*  The fatal vision alcohol goggles deliver memorable lessons on topics like impaired driving, underage drinking and other substance abuse issues. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3541.64s)]
*  Participants perform simple activities or sobriety tests without and then with the goggles performing activities takes twice. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3548.64s)]
*  Performing the activities twice lets participants experience the performance while unimpaired and then impaired. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3555.64s)]
*  Is this who you're talking about? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3560.64s)]
*  Yeah, I was like these. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3562.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3563.64s)]
*  So yeah, it would show like how drunk you were. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3564.64s)]
*  So you would feel drunker the second time because the goggles just alter your kind of perception. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3567.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3571.64s)]
*  So it kind of just looks like if you were trying to think like it just looked like you were looking out like really foggy glass. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3572.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3577.64s)]
*  Like a fun mirror type thing. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3578.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3580.64s)]
*  But yeah, we do this like 9 a.m. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3581.64s)]
*  And a lot of times they would bring like a mangled up car that was involved in an accident. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3583.64s)]
*  And this was a car so and so was in. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3587.64s)]
*  And then the guys there to talk about it. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3589.64s)]
*  I'm like, dude, so you get a DUI and I get to tour the U.S. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3591.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3594.64s)]
*  Doing like door deals with a high school. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3595.64s)]
*  And they would always like have like somebody has spray painted like like Trank like Trank Lord or something on the car. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3599.64s)]
*  And there would be like a like a bloody cheerleader like hanging out of it. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3608.64s)]
*  They always had that shit. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3612.64s)]
*  Yeah, they'd paint the story. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3613.64s)]
*  And then you just go back to class after that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3615.64s)]
*  Like trying to learn about meiosis when we just learned about a guy who mangled a car with his best friend in it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3618.64s)]
*  Now, it's a really weird thing to give high schoolers at literally 9 a.m. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3624.64s)]
*  But it was that was an unbelievable time for high schoolers because it was really the time of day you had just woken up. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3629.64s)]
*  Yeah. You hadn't been awake the first hour and a half. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3635.64s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you were doing. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3637.64s)]
*  You're happy. You're just making sure you were alive. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3639.64s)]
*  9 a.m. you kind of pipe up a little bit and they take you there. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3641.64s)]
*  And then the guy show when you like, yeah, his his handle is like Trank Lord five thousand. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3644.64s)]
*  You're like, we're supposed to follow this. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3650.64s)]
*  Yeah, I never really got the I don't know. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3652.64s)]
*  Like it would make me just feel really sad for the person that lost their life. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3656.64s)]
*  But I don't know if it deterred me from drinking and driving. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3659.64s)]
*  Yeah, like the mom would be there and they were like, Alejandro could have lived to be 20. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3662.64s)]
*  And you're like, only 20. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3666.64s)]
*  Like they would have like, he's still not enough to drink. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3668.64s)]
*  Like he's getting plastered off wine coolers. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3673.64s)]
*  Sometimes the exchange rate, like the verbal exchange rate, like with the person who would come in was so weird that we had a guy officer Bob. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3676.64s)]
*  And he was like the biggest cop they ever made. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3686.64s)]
*  Right. Like they really oh, they put him in the car. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3688.64s)]
*  And then I swear, I don't think he could get out of the car for like years. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3690.64s)]
*  Like he was literally had to live in the cop car. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3694.64s)]
*  He's like that famous. He was that big. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3696.64s)]
*  He was very big. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3699.64s)]
*  Oh, that big. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3700.64s)]
*  And his weight had shut down. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3701.64s)]
*  Look up Covington, Louisiana, D.A.R.E. officer Bob. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3705.64s)]
*  And his weight had shut down. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3710.64s)]
*  Even his windpipe had like pushed like, yeah, and he'd be like, don't do drugs. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3713.64s)]
*  I love you guys. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3718.64s)]
*  You know, but and if he pulled you over for a ticket, he could. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3720.64s)]
*  You had to walk back. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3722.64s)]
*  He just has license registration to the intercom. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3724.64s)]
*  Oh, it was known through town. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3726.64s)]
*  You had to walk back and get the ticket from him. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3727.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3729.64s)]
*  He just was too big. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3730.64s)]
*  He couldn't handle it. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3731.64s)]
*  This might have been before they had photography. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3732.64s)]
*  The Internet. Yeah. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3736.64s)]
*  Maybe just go to Emmett. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3737.64s)]
*  Let's see. So funny. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3738.64s)]
*  I like seeing a fat cop, you know, they're going against society norms. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3742.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3746.64s)]
*  Like I'll still catch them. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3747.64s)]
*  You ever see a cop just being a cop like like living up to the stereotype like at a donut shop. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3748.64s)]

*  Yeah, it is pretty respectable, man. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3755.64s)]
*  Yeah, why not? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3756.64s)]
*  There's something nice about it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3757.64s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen so many great like that's one cool thing you see at the shows now just with like watching the shows, making sure everything after the show you get to talk to the cops. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3758.64s)]
*  I'm like, we threw out this guy. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3766.64s)]
*  We threw out like some dude urinated in a woman's hair like thought it was a bathroom. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3767.64s)]
*  It was wasted. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3773.64s)]
*  What city? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3774.64s)]
*  I think it was Pueblo, Colorado. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3775.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3776.64s)]
*  That high altitude altitude. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3777.64s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3781.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3782.64s)]
*  Some, you know, a child of a couple of, you know, a couple of gold miners or whatever. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3784.64s)]
*  And this dude is just splash scalping some bird. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3790.64s)]
*  And she said she sat there. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3794.64s)]
*  She didn't know what was going on. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3795.64s)]
*  And then after a little while, she like, what's happening? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3796.64s)]
*  Do you know people at Taylor Swift concerts or some girls that wear a diaper because they don't want to miss any of the concert solo just pee themselves? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3800.64s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing it because I mean tickets are so expensive. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3806.64s)]
*  Like a pee probably cost them like six hundred forty eight dollars or something. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3809.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3812.64s)]
*  It's your time. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3813.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3814.64s)]
*  So you might as well just pee your pants on it. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3815.64s)]
*  Honestly, some total Swift fans say they're wearing adult diapers to a show so they don't miss any songs. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3816.64s)]
*  It totally makes sense, especially these days. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3822.64s)]
*  I think if anybody wears a diaper to my show, it's because they're going to shit themselves from packing to me. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3824.64s)]
*  Zenz. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3827.64s)]

*  It happens more like a lot of cops watch my stuff, which is weird. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3860.64s)]
*  I'm like, when do you guys have time to do this? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3864.64s)]
*  But it makes me feel good when they're like, dude, I love your stuff. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=3865.64s)]

*  Did they have that technology back then? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4609.64s)]
*  That had to be a hard pitch. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4611.64s)]
*  Like the first guy to do cremation. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4613.64s)]
*  We could just burn the motherfucker. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4615.64s)]
*  What? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4617.64s)]
*  I don't know, I'm just spitballing. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4618.64s)]
*  I'm just thinking about the future, dude. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4620.64s)]
*  I'm not saying Satan's winning, but we could just fucking torch the guy. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4623.64s)]
*  That seems like how you airdrop yourself to hell is just by doing cremation. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4628.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4632.64s)]
*  It just seems, I don't know. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4633.64s)]
*  Well, I think it also used to have all the mummies and the ain't. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4635.64s)]
*  They would mummify people. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4641.64s)]
*  They would bury them. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4643.64s)]
*  One of the big things back in the day was they would bury you with things you needed to get to the next life. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4644.64s)]
*  Sometimes I think that could be one of the reasons why we're stalling out here as a society, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4650.64s)]
*  because we're not even burying people. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4656.64s)]
*  First of all, we're burning people up. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4658.64s)]
*  There's no way God looks down and is like, chill. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4660.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4664.64s)]
*  Good. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4665.64s)]
*  Nice. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4666.64s)]
*  They're burning. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4667.64s)]
*  Right next to the wood fire pizzas. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4668.64s)]
*  Yeah, but they... [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4670.64s)]
*  Dude, imagine if you went to a funeral where somebody's cremated and then went to a wood burning pizza oven after. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4672.64s)]
*  Dude, that would be a really good two for one. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4677.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4681.64s)]
*  Like, burn your dad, get some barbecue chicken pizza. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4682.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4685.64s)]
*  The whole thought of it freaks me out. It's so weird. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4686.64s)]
*  Oh, it's so weird. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4688.64s)]
*  One thing to me that's interesting was I think we used to prepare people literally. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4689.64s)]
*  They would prepare people. They would bury them with different... [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4694.64s)]
*  Can you look it up? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4697.64s)]
*  That is true. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4698.64s)]
*  They'd find a lot of people buried either with their cat or... [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4699.64s)]
*  First of all, my cat would be so pissed down there. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4702.64s)]
*  Yeah. Stuff they needed for the afterlife. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4704.64s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4706.64s)]
*  What are you bringing? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4708.64s)]
*  Yeah, bring up burying people with afterlife stuff. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4709.64s)]
*  The ancient Egyptians' tomb was supplied with items the deceased would need in the afterlife. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4713.64s)]
*  Food, household goods, and the body itself. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4717.64s)]
*  Often the supplies provided were also duplicated in other forms. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4719.64s)]
*  Food and furniture, for example, were painted or carved into the banquet scenes on the tomb walls. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4723.64s)]
*  But yeah, they needed you to get to the afterlife. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4728.64s)]
*  So I think then a lot more people were actually making it through to the afterlife. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4730.64s)]
*  Now, we're not even burying people with shit so that it's fucking stalled them back out. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4734.64s)]
*  It's like Burning Man. It's like you didn't bring anything. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4738.64s)]
*  You're not going to the next life. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4740.64s)]
*  So the spirit just gets kicked back here. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4742.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4744.64s)]
*  That's why everybody gets bored and like, oh, this guy's dumb as fuck because he just stalled out here. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4745.64s)]
*  It's like we're almost like... [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4750.64s)]
*  It's a giant potluck. You didn't bring anything. They just send you right back. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4751.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's one of the problems. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4754.64s)]
*  Our spirits are stalled out because we're not getting the right tools to get... [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4756.64s)]
*  What do you think you would bring? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4760.64s)]
*  It's like Zelda Breath of the Wild. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4762.64s)]
*  I'd bring that thing that lets you, like, when you jump off a something, it lets you glide kind of. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4763.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah? I thought you meant one of the pull-up bars you put on a door frame. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4767.64s)]
*  Dude, if you're a chick and you go to a guy's house and he has a pull-up bar on the door frame, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4772.64s)]
*  girl, you better wrap up because his wife is going to be home soon. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4776.64s)]
*  Let's just say he's a Theta Chi. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4780.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4782.64s)]
*  Let's be real factual about that. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4783.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'd probably... Yeah, those, those, those. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4784.64s)]
*  No girl sees that and is like, oh, fuck yeah. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4786.64s)]
*  You can't afford a Planet Fitness membership. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4789.64s)]
*  Dude, every place I go perform for colleges, like, apparently the frat or whatever that, like, is roofing everybody is all over the place. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4793.64s)]
*  Roofing everybody is always Pike, I feel like. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4800.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pike's a big one. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4802.64s)]
*  Do you hear that? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4803.64s)]
*  Our neighbors in the frat, in college were Pike and that was a whole, like, stereotype. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4804.64s)]
*  They got kicked off campus my first semester there and then they just come to our parties like, dog, no. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4808.64s)]
*  Yeah, bro, yeah. They're notorious for it. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4815.64s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4817.64s)]
*  For just really having a blast. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4818.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing a college gig this week, actually. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4820.64s)]
*  You are? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4822.64s)]
*  St. Louis, Mizzou, Mizzou? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4823.64s)]
*  I'm flying into St. Louis, but it's always far. It's in Rollo. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4825.64s)]
*  Maybe University of Missouri? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4828.64s)]
*  It's in Rollo? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4830.64s)]
*  Can you look at what's in Mizzou? It's not on my website. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4831.64s)]
*  The great part, you don't have to promote these college shows. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4833.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's nice. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4835.64s)]
*  Can you type in Rollo University? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4836.64s)]
*  Dude, I don't know anything. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4839.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. R-O-L-L-O. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4841.64s)]
*  I think it's an O. R-E-L-L-O. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4843.64s)]
*  I don't know. But, yeah, I will say, like, the front row is just all just frat guys yelling. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4845.64s)]
*  I did, you know, Sean Evans from Hot Ones, yeah? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4852.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4854.64s)]
*  I remember when I was in college, I was like, I'm going to go to Hot Ones live at a college with him, me and him. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4855.64s)]
*  No. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4857.64s)]
*  It was so fun. But all these frat guys were in the crowd, just be like, put on more sauce, pussy! [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4858.64s)]
*  I'm like getting heckled while crying, eating chicken wings. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4863.64s)]
*  Frat guys are the best people ever. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4867.64s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4869.64s)]
*  They're just walking exclamation points. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4870.64s)]
*  People are like, yeah, like we were out the other night and those guys like recording, one guy would record me, one guy would show someone his phone, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4871.64s)]
*  it would be like, upper deck of Zen or fuck your dad or something like that. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4876.64s)]
*  And then the other guys were recording, you still have to give your answer. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4880.64s)]
*  Oh, the street interviews? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4883.64s)]
*  Dude, those guys spawn out of nowhere. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4884.64s)]
*  You can be anywhere and a guy will pop up, be like, yo, gay son or thought daughter, what would you rather have? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4886.64s)]
*  I'm like, dog, we're in a fucking Barnes and Noble, dude. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4892.64s)]
*  How did you get in here? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4895.64s)]
*  They just pop out of nowhere. That's content now. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4896.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4898.64s)]
*  Content is surprise content. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4899.64s)]
*  Oh, bro. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4900.64s)]
*  That's one thing that I haven't been like, I don't like that ambush style shit. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4901.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's shocking. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4905.64s)]
*  And I don't like the surprise stuff because you forget that when you're talking to somebody, like if it's at an event or something like that, that somebody could be recording it. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4906.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4913.64s)]
*  I mean, where was I? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4914.64s)]
*  It's too scary because if you don't know, I never even know what I'm saying half the time. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4915.64s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4918.64s)]
*  Dude, I was in New York and some guy tapped me on the shoulder, had headphones and sunglasses on and he tapped me on the shoulder. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4919.64s)]
*  I turned around and he goes with the camera. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4923.64s)]
*  He had a camera in a mic and he goes, when was the last time you cried? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4925.64s)]
*  Like, bro, huh? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4927.64s)]
*  I'm walking in a park by myself probably pretty soon. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4930.64s)]
*  We're not far from it. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4933.64s)]
*  But I had to ask the guy after, I was like, like I started to riff with him and I was like, dude, I don't know who this guy is. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4934.64s)]
*  Like, can we, I was like, can you actually just delete it? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4940.64s)]
*  He's like, no, for sure. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4942.64s)]
*  I was like, no, like, let me watch you delete it. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4943.64s)]
*  It was very weird. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4945.64s)]
*  Yeah, this pop up and you're such a recognizable guy. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=4946.64s)]

*  So nervous. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5270.64s)]

*  the show in a weird direction. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5287.64s)]
*  You know, I have the set in my head and I'm like, yeah, this is here we go. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5288.64s)]
*  We're going to do it. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5291.64s)]
*  And then I'm just like nervous. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5292.64s)]

*  they knew or was at least aware of me. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5309.64s)]
*  And then I took the wrong way to get on the stage. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5311.64s)]
*  I'm fucking panicking. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5313.64s)]

*  We hit her up, but because everybody kept tagging us in some sort of like, get Gypsy Rose. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5529.64s)]
*  And we hit her up, but she didn't reply back. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5534.64s)]
*  But I think she just played it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5536.64s)]
*  Didn't she just play in like NBA All-Star Weekend or something? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5537.64s)]
*  Did she really? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5542.64s)]
*  I thought she did. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5543.64s)]
*  They'd be putting everybody in that fucking game. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5544.64s)]
*  They put anybody. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5546.64s)]
*  It's just like Jack Harlow guarding up on Gypsy Rose. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5547.64s)]
*  That shit is crazy, bro. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5550.64s)]

*  What's going on? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5558.64s)]
*  Kid rocks the rep, dude. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5559.64s)]
*  He's just blowing a crack pipe instead of a whistle. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5561.64s)]
*  I want to smoke crack so bad. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5565.64s)]
*  Bro. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5567.64s)]
*  It looks warm. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5568.64s)]
*  Well, one of the best things about it, I've heard, is that you can stay up and get things done. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5569.64s)]
*  I feel that so much. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5575.64s)]
*  Because Coke, it's just sometimes it's too erratic to get things done. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5577.64s)]
*  But crack this so you can actually get some things done. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5580.64s)]
*  The MyPillow guy, Michael, not sure of his name. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5582.64s)]
*  Mike Lindell. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5586.64s)]
*  Mike Lindell. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5587.64s)]
*  He has a book that I read and it's about his crack addiction and how he held on to his brand the whole time. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5588.64s)]
*  He was flying to Vegas on the weekends to stay up all night and gamble. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5594.64s)]
*  He was like counting cards and he'd make just enough money to keep his pillow obsession going. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5598.64s)]
*  So he made a pillow company while cracked out. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5604.64s)]
*  So he made something to sleep while he was never sleeping. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5607.64s)]
*  It's fucking genius if you think about it. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5610.64s)]
*  He's like, somebody's like, how does it feel? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5612.64s)]
*  He's like, I have no idea. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5614.64s)]
*  I've never tried it. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5615.64s)]
*  That's just where I hide my cocaine on flights. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5616.64s)]
*  That's crazy to be addicted to crack and make a pillow. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5619.64s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5623.64s)]
*  It is, bro. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5625.64s)]

*  Like I know people who used to be really addicted to heroin and now they have their own company. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5635.64s)]
*  It's like, I feel like they fought through so much. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5638.64s)]
*  I trust their business more almost. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5641.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5643.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, a lot of addicts, you know, they're really capable. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5644.64s)]
*  They just got caught up, you know, doing the wrong thing. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5647.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5650.64s)]

*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5656.64s)]
*  I think you have some of that. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5657.64s)]
*  Even as we talk about it, you're always a little bit dialed in. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5658.64s)]
*  Like, what do I want to do? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5660.64s)]

*  Yeah, that's a bold move. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5763.64s)]
*  Dude, that's like when me and my brother were kids, we used to like if one of us had to like use the toilet and the other one did at the same time, the first one would get on and like face the back of the tank. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5765.64s)]
*  And the second one would sit like back to back against him like the Hurley logo. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5774.64s)]

*  If you're like straining your body and you can feel the other person straining their body, you know. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5787.64s)]

*  And it'll just have like we read it on the back. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5881.64s)]
*  Just all kind of like just kind of urban slang, you know? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5886.64s)]

*  The Japanese. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5896.64s)]
*  It's so clean over there. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5897.64s)]
*  I hear. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5898.64s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like if you sneeze, you get shot. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5899.64s)]
*  I. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5903.64s)]
*  Yeah, they're so clean. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5904.64s)]
*  You ever been or no? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5906.64s)]
*  Yeah, I've been. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5907.64s)]
*  I don't remember it that good. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5908.64s)]
*  But I do remember it was like a homestay or something. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5909.64s)]
*  I was doing this thing called Semester at Sea. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5913.64s)]
*  OK, and it was like a homestay. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5915.64s)]
*  So you would go and just stay with the family. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5916.64s)]
*  I was just talking about this the other day with Trevor Bauer and he was on here. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5919.64s)]
*  But it was like the family let you stay with them as a Japanese family. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5922.64s)]
*  She literally showed up on their door at a certain time and you had and you just stayed there for a couple of nights. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5927.64s)]
*  And do they pick you or you pick them or it's just like random? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5932.64s)]
*  There was some program that linked you up. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5934.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5936.64s)]
*  And so then I showed up and we don't know what to say. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5937.64s)]
*  So we're all just keep standing around doing that. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5939.64s)]
*  And then we ate like on the we sat on the floor and ate. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5941.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5945.64s)]
*  And then they let me sleep in their room. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5946.64s)]
*  There's only like three little rooms. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5947.64s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5949.64s)]
*  They might have slept like in the wall or something like and I slept on like a like a fast mat or something. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5951.64s)]
*  There's no like real bedding. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5957.64s)]
*  It's just like a little. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5958.64s)]
*  You sleep OK? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5959.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think I was fine. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5960.64s)]
*  And then, oh, one thing I remember I would hug. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5961.64s)]
*  I gave the mama hug and a kiss on the cheek when I met her just is like just where I'm from is pretty normal. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5964.64s)]
*  So the next two days she kept having her friends come over and right when they come in the door, she'd go like this, you know, because she wanted me to hug him and get like just like. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5969.64s)]
*  Pimping you out. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5977.64s)]
*  Yeah, they just didn't have. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5978.64s)]
*  She's charging money. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5979.64s)]
*  Come kiss the American boy. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5980.64s)]
*  You should have no idea. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5982.64s)]
*  So that was kind of that was just kind of. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5983.64s)]
*  He worked in the Red Light District. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5985.64s)]
*  Yeah, I might have. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5987.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5989.64s)]
*  Yeah, that was the worst thing about the Red Light District was that. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5990.64s)]
*  It was so cold once there was no emotion, you're like, oh, there's no emotion. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5992.64s)]
*  Small talk was interesting. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5995.64s)]
*  It's just fast. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5997.64s)]
*  They want you to bust and get back out on the street. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=5998.64s)]
*  I was nervous. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6000.64s)]
*  I was probably about 60 percent chub, because it's hard to be like, oh, yeah, there's no emotion. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6001.64s)]
*  It's like weird. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6006.64s)]
*  There's small talk. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6007.64s)]
*  There's just still drawing from the last guy. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6008.64s)]
*  It felt like a doctor's office that they want you to come real fast at. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6010.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6013.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's like a guy high fiving me on the way in. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6014.64s)]
*  I'm like, oh, gross, you know, and then there's shirts. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6016.64s)]
*  But that my one had merch or something you were leaving. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6020.64s)]
*  Yeah, I should start doing that. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6022.64s)]
*  Look up that Red Light District merch. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6024.64s)]
*  Yeah, but see if they have any cardigans, whatever, from the Red Light District. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6026.64s)]
*  You can't take photos when you're walking through because, you know, a lot of it's it's very private. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6030.64s)]
*  And a lot of people don't want it to get back to their families. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6034.64s)]
*  But you think about something with like the Ray-Ban meta glasses. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6036.64s)]
*  Have you seen those? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6038.64s)]
*  They record and they just look like normal glasses. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6040.64s)]
*  You could just be in there. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6042.64s)]
*  No, you could be anywhere. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6043.64s)]
*  You could be fucking at a matinee. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6045.64s)]
*  Remember, I was in the Red Light District. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6047.64s)]
*  Matinee. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6049.64s)]
*  Remember how mad movies used to get? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6050.64s)]
*  They'd be like, hey, don't record this shit. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6051.64s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6053.64s)]
*  Now that's the only thing companies want you to do is record their shit, record it and then post it. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6055.64s)]
*  It's like, oh, cool. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6061.64s)]
*  We have a movie. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6062.64s)]
*  Screenshot it and put it on TikTok. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6063.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6064.64s)]
*  So, dude, you could just wear that and walk around. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6065.64s)]
*  But if you take a phone, they like yelling, start banging on the windows. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6066.64s)]
*  Like, put the fucking phone away. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6069.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6070.64s)]
*  So this is recording stuff. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6071.64s)]
*  These glasses that they're showing right now. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6072.64s)]
*  They're really good. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6073.64s)]
*  Have you tried the new thing that people are doing with the AppleVision? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6074.64s)]
*  The AppleVision? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6078.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6079.64s)]
*  Yeah, I tried them. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6080.64s)]
*  No way. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6081.64s)]
*  Yeah, I tried AppleVision. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6082.64s)]
*  Pro. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6083.64s)]
*  They're pretty cool. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6084.64s)]
*  I borrowed them from a friend. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6085.64s)]
*  I don't know the benefit of it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6086.64s)]
*  It's just like rich people to get away from their families, I think. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6087.64s)]
*  Burt would love these. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6088.64s)]
*  Shut up, Burt. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6089.64s)]
*  I know. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6090.64s)]
*  But you just put them on and then you can like, you just, it's not full VR. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6091.64s)]
*  It's augmented reality, I guess. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6094.64s)]
*  So any screen, like if you had YouTube screen, you could make it as big or as small as you [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6096.64s)]
*  want it, which I kind of know the benefit is. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6100.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6102.64s)]
*  But you can like scroll Twitter over here and like watch. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6103.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, I made a video on it. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6104.64s)]
*  Oh, but it's all happening in front of you? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6106.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6108.64s)]
*  But you can place shit around you. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6109.64s)]
*  So there's, yeah, so go there. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6111.64s)]
*  So like, that's what it looks like. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6113.64s)]
*  Like the joke in this is I'm playing like subway surfer while she's talking to me. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6114.64s)]
*  And that's real. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6117.64s)]
*  So you could be talking to someone in front of you and be playing, have a window open [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6118.64s)]
*  somehow, virtually between you guys that you see through the, through the. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6122.64s)]
*  You could be on a date with a girl and realistically be watching a Theovon podcast. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6125.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6129.64s)]
*  So it's, I don't know. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6130.64s)]
*  The benefit of it is like, if you just want to, I don't really know. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6132.64s)]
*  Like sit on your couch and not have a TV. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6135.64s)]
*  Like the joke in this at the very end of the video I do is the guy lives in a studio [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6137.64s)]
*  apartment by himself and he's so lonely and he's like, I have everything I ever [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6141.64s)]
*  wanted, a TV, a kitchen, a hot wife, and just by himself. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6145.64s)]
*  So I think it's great if you're lonely. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6148.64s)]
*  But I don't know the full appeal of it quite yet. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6150.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6155.64s)]
*  It's like, this looks like I'd rather just use my computer. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6159.64s)]
*  You also look insane. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6162.64s)]
*  You look like you should be in the Salem witch trials. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6164.64s)]
*  I can't believe that was real. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6167.64s)]
*  You accuse somebody of being a witch and they're like to the lake. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6169.64s)]
*  Oh, this, bro, there's a, um, yeah. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6172.64s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6176.64s)]
*  Like if you were a witch, the Salem witch trials, bring these, what happened to these [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6177.64s)]
*  bitches? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6182.64s)]
*  Well, we got to know, man. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6184.64s)]
*  The Salem witch trials occurred in colonial Massachusetts. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6185.64s)]
*  Well, shout out Amherst, bro, is just there. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6188.64s)]
*  This is what happened? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6191.64s)]
*  Um, yeah, probably by UMass, um, between early 1692 and mid 1693. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6193.64s)]
*  So bro, this was a short, this was in a year and a half. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6198.64s)]
*  More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6202.64s)]
*  Probably all Geminized too. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6205.64s)]
*  Only 20 were executed. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6207.64s)]
*  So 10% out of the 200. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6208.64s)]
*  I wonder what made them think that they really were. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6210.64s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6213.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6214.64s)]
*  Can you see what determined if a witch was killed during the Salem witch trials? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6215.64s)]
*  And witches are fake, right? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6220.64s)]
*  So those 20 got got, and they weren't witches, right? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6221.64s)]
*  Well, I think there was also some people at that time that was, uh, witching. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6224.64s)]
*  Oh, I would guess, you know, because somebody's going to fucking witch if you're chilling [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6228.64s)]
*  that much. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6232.64s)]
*  There's nothing to do. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6233.64s)]
*  Yeah, that is true. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6234.64s)]
*  It's a good side hustle. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6235.64s)]
*  Most accusers were teenage girls, mostly populated by Puritan. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6236.64s)]
*  Salem village was, um, it was virtually impossible to disprove charges of witchcraft in Salem [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6240.64s)]
*  and defendants were convicted with no evidence other than personal accusations. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6245.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6249.64s)]
*  The presence of a devil's mark on their bodies. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6250.64s)]
*  And that's where the jury duty came from. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6252.64s)]
*  The presence of a devil's mark on their body. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6255.64s)]
*  So that's if you had like a birthmark. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6257.64s)]
*  Damn. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6259.64s)]
*  Oh, God, I got a birthmark right here. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6260.64s)]
*  Drew Brees would have been. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6262.64s)]
*  Out. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6265.64s)]
*  What were some of the tests? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6266.64s)]
*  So unfair. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6267.64s)]
*  Witch swimming was a practice of tying up and dunking the accused in a body of water [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6269.64s)]
*  to determine whether they sink or float. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6273.64s)]
*  Sinking to the bottom indicated the accused was innocent while floating indicated a guilty [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6276.64s)]
*  verdict. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6280.64s)]
*  Aren't you? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6281.64s)]
*  If you're a little larger, you float more. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6282.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6284.64s)]
*  So a thin lady. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6285.64s)]
*  Um, wasn't a witch. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6288.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6290.64s)]
*  Anybody who might have been plus side was. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6291.64s)]
*  But floating indicated guilt. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6293.64s)]
*  Sandwich. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6295.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6296.64s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy though. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6297.64s)]
*  So you just, man, that would be the worst because it's basically being the dunk tank [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6298.64s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6302.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6303.64s)]
*  Like how would you make yourself sink? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6304.64s)]
*  If you were a witch, we just hold your breath. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6305.64s)]
*  I would swim down to the bottom too. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6308.64s)]
*  I'm sure you're like back there about to go out and they're like, Hey, do you have any [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6310.64s)]
*  tips or whatever? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6313.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6314.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6315.64s)]
*  I'm nervous. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6316.64s)]
*  Swimming at the bottom. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6317.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6318.64s)]
*  How long do you have to be at the bottom before it indicated that you're innocent? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6319.64s)]
*  And then even if you're innocent, you come back up. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6322.64s)]
*  Um, during the Salem witch trials in 1692 and 1693, there were several tests used to [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6325.64s)]
*  determine if someone was a witch. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6329.64s)]
*  The touch test. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6331.64s)]
*  The afflicted person, someone who claimed to be under the influence of witchcraft, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6332.64s)]
*  would convulse or exhibit symptoms in the presence of the accused. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6336.64s)]
*  If the afflicted person stopped convulsing upon touching the accused, it was believed [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6339.64s)]
*  to be the evidence of witchcraft. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6344.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6345.64s)]
*  Dude, the saddest one is number six. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6346.64s)]
*  Just confession. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6348.64s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6349.64s)]
*  I'm a witch. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6350.64s)]
*  That's just somebody who's just like, I'm done with this planet. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6351.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6352.64s)]
*  Confession. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6353.64s)]
*  Many accused individuals were coerced or tortured into confessing to witchcraft. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6354.64s)]
*  That's kind of sad. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6358.64s)]
*  Physical examination for witch's marks. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6360.64s)]
*  Number five. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6362.64s)]
*  The accused would be searched for supposed physical marks believed to be signs of witchcraft, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6363.64s)]
*  such as moles, birthmarks, or scars. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6366.64s)]
*  Dude, what if you just have a mole on your back and they're like, this is a frickin' [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6368.64s)]
*  chocolate chip of hell. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6371.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's witchcraft. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6373.64s)]
*  That's the devil trying to communicate with us. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6374.64s)]
*  What? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6376.64s)]
*  You're a mole. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6377.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6378.64s)]
*  Damn. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6380.64s)]
*  That would be so tough because you're always out after this. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6381.64s)]
*  I bet for that year and a half you were acting like they're not witches. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6384.64s)]
*  Not a witch, yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6386.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6387.64s)]
*  You can't even sneeze. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6388.64s)]
*  You can't blow out candles. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6389.64s)]
*  Imagine it's your birthday and you blow out these candles. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6390.64s)]
*  You're like, I can't do that. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6393.64s)]
*  You see a broom, you have to be like, oh, what is that? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6395.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6397.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6398.64s)]
*  Why don't I beat my husband in the head with it, huh? [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6399.64s)]
*  Why don't I beat my astro-mag in the head with it? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6401.64s)]
*  Wait, people use these to fly? [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6404.64s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6405.64s)]
*  He was like, don't do drugs. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6406.64s)]
*  And his wife would just beat him in the fucking head. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6408.64s)]
*  And people were like, God, he's bleeding. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6411.64s)]
*  Those school assemblies, it's just on set like WWE. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6414.64s)]
*  Like it just makes you want to wrestle or do drugs. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6418.64s)]
*  It was such a crazy time to see everybody too because nothing... [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6421.64s)]
*  The first one we ever had, I remember in junior high, in middle school, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6426.64s)]
*  kids were peeing on the heaters in the bathroom. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6430.64s)]
*  It was old school heaters and it would steam up the bathroom. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6433.64s)]
*  Like a sauna? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6435.64s)]
*  Yes, you couldn't even walk it. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6436.64s)]
*  Like you couldn't see. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6438.64s)]
*  Just piss vape? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6440.64s)]
*  Oh, piss vape, dude. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6441.64s)]
*  So people were just making it, just making it fucking steam up in there. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6443.64s)]
*  That's horrendous. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6448.64s)]
*  And then you'd see some dude in there with his shirt off. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6449.64s)]
*  I feel like, what the fuck? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6452.64s)]
*  I kind of think so. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6453.64s)]
*  Equinox? [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6454.64s)]
*  This trank addict doing. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6455.64s)]
*  But that was kind of crazy. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6457.64s)]
*  But then as you got into junior high or high school too, the assemblies were just... [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6459.64s)]
*  Because you got to sit with your boys and see your boys outside of class and shit. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6462.64s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6466.64s)]
*  It was so fun. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6467.64s)]
*  Did you guys have talent shows and stuff like that? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6468.64s)]
*  I don't think we did. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6470.64s)]
*  Oh, we had talent shows, dude. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6471.64s)]
*  Did you ever sign up? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6472.64s)]
*  I got to host at one time with my friend Rebecca. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6473.64s)]
*  Really? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6476.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6477.64s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6478.64s)]
*  And this girl played piano at one time and I'd never heard a girl play piano before and [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6479.64s)]
*  she sang, bro. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6483.64s)]
*  She's a fucking witch. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6484.64s)]
*  Yeah, we fucking cooked her the next day. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6485.64s)]
*  I was like, that bitch is going to sink. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6488.64s)]
*  That sounds like a ringtone. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6492.64s)]
*  Fry her ass! [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6494.64s)]
*  Damn. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6496.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6497.64s)]
*  I don't know if we ever had... [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6499.64s)]
*  That was the only assembly we had was that. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6501.64s)]
*  I don't think we had other ones. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6503.64s)]
*  Prep rallies were pretty low. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6504.64s)]
*  Prep rallies. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6505.64s)]
*  What was that? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6506.64s)]
*  Just to get fired up on the school? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6507.64s)]
*  It's like 4th of July for your school. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6508.64s)]
*  It was like, we're going to win. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6510.64s)]
*  And we never won, dude. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6511.64s)]
*  People were like, are we going to win? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6513.64s)]
*  That was even the most hopeful sign that somebody would make. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6516.64s)]
*  If you have to have the prep rally, you're not going to win. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6518.64s)]
*  Your school's already filled with losers. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6521.64s)]
*  We need to cheer ourselves up. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6523.64s)]
*  Yeah, we might not win some of the signs. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6526.64s)]
*  Yeah, buff schools never had those rallies. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6528.64s)]
*  Oh, bro, our school was... [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6530.64s)]
*  We could not win shit, dude. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6532.64s)]
*  We guys go to any sports because our school's really good at tennis and swimming. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6534.64s)]
*  You know, white people. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6538.64s)]
*  Oh, really? That's hella white. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6539.64s)]
*  We had ROTC, like the Wood and Gun gang or whatever. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6540.64s)]
*  Those dudes that would like... [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6543.64s)]
*  Yeah, the guy would flash his Wood and Gun during school. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6545.64s)]
*  We'd be like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6548.64s)]
*  You going to finish that blueberry muffin? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6550.64s)]
*  You're like, yeah. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6551.64s)]
*  And he's like, what about now? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6552.64s)]
*  He has two splinters on his hand. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6554.64s)]
*  Dude, then the kids from Woodshop come up and back you up. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6556.64s)]
*  Leave him alone. Leave him alone, Corbin. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6558.64s)]
*  Put the cookies down. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6561.64s)]
*  Those kids were crazy, but that was kind of fun. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6563.64s)]
*  If you took Woodshop in high school, you were a stoner. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6565.64s)]
*  You either made a birdhouse or you made a bong. That was it. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6568.64s)]
*  You're like, I made a fucking pipe or something. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6571.64s)]
*  Yeah, some dudes, somebody's always trying to make their sister like a little table or something. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6573.64s)]
*  There's always something real sad going on in there. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6578.64s)]
*  Carving like a sparrow. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6580.64s)]
*  A box for... Yeah, there's Woodshop Bongs right there. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6582.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Woodshop was just like a stoner's dream. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6585.64s)]
*  You just do nothing all day except labor work. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6588.64s)]
*  You know, I fucking love this class. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6592.64s)]
*  And the crazy part was the saws were always going to. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6594.64s)]
*  Nobody could hear anybody in the class. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6596.64s)]
*  The teachers give me instructions that nobody can hear. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6598.64s)]
*  Yeah, if you want... [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6600.64s)]
*  What a waste of a class, but in the best way. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6604.64s)]
*  Dude, I don't know if I talked about this before, but I had to. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6607.64s)]
*  We had the science teacher in 11th grade. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6609.64s)]
*  And he, I think he got fired because he would stare at these girls' tits. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6611.64s)]
*  He would sit this girl in the front row. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6614.64s)]
*  I think I talked about this maybe on here before. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6616.64s)]
*  But he'd sit this girl in the front row. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6618.64s)]
*  And we would count because there's a hot chick and me and my friend next to her. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6620.64s)]
*  We'd count every time we'd look at her tits. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6622.64s)]
*  Crazy, dude. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6624.64s)]
*  Like, blatant. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6626.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, and you got a support guy. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6628.64s)]
*  Whose team are you on? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6630.64s)]
*  I was there for a good game. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6632.64s)]
*  You know, it's like two teams in the Super Bowl you don't care about, but it's a good team for some matchup. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6634.64s)]
*  Because she would lean into it. She'd like, fuck him out. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6638.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6640.64s)]
*  He probably is not doing well now. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6641.64s)]
*  Yeah, there was always those chicks that started to know they had power over the teacher too. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6643.64s)]
*  And they would just like, wear like, show more tits. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6647.64s)]
*  Completely. Test day coming up. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6652.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. We had a guy who came in the class. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6655.64s)]
*  He started... This was the first dude I ever heard talk about kombucha, right? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6659.64s)]
*  This is 20 years ago. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6662.64s)]
*  This dude came in, started yelling. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6664.64s)]
*  And he was like, this is a huge thing. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6666.64s)]
*  A big, huge glass jar he made of kombucha and water, whatever. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6668.64s)]
*  And he's telling everybody, he's like, this is the secret of the future, right? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6673.64s)]
*  This will change your life. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6677.64s)]
*  And then he would go into the little closet that was attached to the classroom. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6679.64s)]
*  And come out like 30 minutes later and people were like, what the fuck, bro? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6683.64s)]
*  Was he just making boots back there? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6687.64s)]
*  We have no idea what he was doing, but it was so bizarre. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6689.64s)]
*  And then he came because our main teacher got busted dating a girl at school. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6691.64s)]
*  They put a wire on her. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6695.64s)]
*  And they were going to run off together and the cops caught him somewhere on the highway. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6697.64s)]
*  Damn. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6702.64s)]
*  And we all kind of felt... I mean, obviously it was messed up. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6703.64s)]
*  But everybody just was like, man, it was sad because everybody loved him too. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6706.64s)]
*  He was an awesome teacher. He didn't seem like a bad guy. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6710.64s)]
*  I think there's... I think a lot of... [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6713.64s)]
*  I think some dudes that teach never... their brain never leaves high school too. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6718.64s)]
*  No, I mean, they're just surrounded by high schoolers. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6722.64s)]
*  And eventually they're just like, these are my coworkers, question mark? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6724.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6727.64s)]
*  When these guys get busted for it, it's sad as fuck. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6729.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6732.64s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing's just sad, you know? [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6733.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6735.64s)]
*  Did you see those Trump sneakers that came out? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6736.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6739.64s)]
*  The funniest comment was like, those are the January 6th's. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6740.64s)]
*  Shit, I'm fucking crying. Can you see a photo of them? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6743.64s)]
*  They look like Hulk Hogan or like... [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6747.64s)]
*  Oh, they do kind of. I didn't even think about that. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6750.64s)]
*  Or, fuck, what's his name? Rick Flair. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6752.64s)]
*  They just look like they make you want to go, woo! [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6755.64s)]
*  Yeah, they kind of have a Hacksaw Jim Duggan vibe too. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6757.64s)]
*  They kind of have that 80s like... [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6759.64s)]
*  I wonder if a lot of black dudes would sport these as well. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6761.64s)]
*  These might be pretty tough, man. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6764.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude, you could probably flip those pretty good on StockX. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6767.64s)]
*  Can we get a better look at them, Nick? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6770.64s)]
*  They should have like a song that plays when you walk in them. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6772.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6775.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6776.64s)]
*  I wanna be American. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6777.64s)]
*  I think he could have... What would he have? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6780.64s)]
*  Each step. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6784.64s)]
*  Yeah, each step is another note. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6786.64s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta complete the song. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6788.64s)]
*  That shit should have Heelys in it. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6790.64s)]
*  But it has like a little like mudflat behind it. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6793.64s)]
*  Bro, those are actually kind of fucking tough, bro. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6798.64s)]
*  Do you think we can get a pair of those, Nick? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6801.64s)]
*  Yes, for everybody. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6804.64s)]
*  Can I have one? [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=6807.64s)]

*  at the mothership, I think because there's no phones. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7105.08s)]

*  You know, but that's also what it is. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7164.08s)]
*  It's like the lab factory open mic got really weird for a while. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7168.08s)]
*  Like when I was doing it early on, like 2015, it's like because people are flying from [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7171.08s)]
*  the United States to be like, this is my one chance at making it in Hollywood. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7175.08s)]
*  So now I think Kill Tony's that where it's a lot of Austin comics, but it's also people [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7178.08s)]

*  And it might be some people get up there and they're in front of a million people. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7188.08s)]
*  Eighty one thousand live and they have no material. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7191.08s)]
*  They're up there just like, I just want to say hi, Tony. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7194.08s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, like you said, it's like America's got talent. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7197.08s)]

*  You want to see people do good. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7200.08s)]
*  The hilarity of it, too, is they give them one minute, right, which is you're not. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7202.08s)]
*  You can't. It's impossible. It's so hard. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7205.08s)]

*  Yeah. For 20 minutes. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7215.08s)]
*  Professional comedian versus a guy who was told he was funny at a gender reveal six months ago. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7216.08s)]
*  I mean, this structure is like so in favor of Tony. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7222.08s)]
*  That's why and Tony's so good at it. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7225.08s)]
*  Tony is so fucking funny and quick with it. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7227.08s)]
*  But yet to do a minute like I was talking about doing five minutes at the arena show a minute in front of like to get a premise out where people like right off the bat like you. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7229.08s)]

*  They have no chill for anybody to go to the guy. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7273.08s)]
*  I feel what he was wearing, but he had like a like a button up t shirt. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7277.08s)]
*  Maybe you can scroll around and keep going. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7280.08s)]
*  But he walks out and immediately insults the audience. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7282.08s)]
*  And the thing with the show is like this show is so big and their fans are so loyal that these people love Tony. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7284.08s)]

*  That he didn't understand the concept of it. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7494.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7496.08s)]
*  Was he hammered? He's just like, hey, stop roasting these people. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7497.08s)]
*  It's like, I will never say anything bad about a veteran. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7500.08s)]
*  I felt like that's like Tony's icon right there, too. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7505.08s)]
*  He loves like, I'm not a veteran. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7508.08s)]
*  It's like going to bed. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7511.08s)]

*  Yeah. What else do you think about doing a film? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7524.08s)]
*  Do you start to piece any stuff? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7526.08s)]
*  I know you were talking about doing a TV show at one point. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7527.08s)]
*  Yeah, I've pushed some stuff. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7529.08s)]
*  I'm kind of working with a few people on something. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7530.08s)]
*  But I think my main focus is anything that I can make. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7532.08s)]
*  I don't want to be like too many, I guess, roadblocks going to some of these. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7535.08s)]
*  So I'll show interest if somebody wants to work with me. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7541.08s)]
*  I'll be like, hey, I'm down. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7542.08s)]
*  But like, you got to come to me. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7543.08s)]
*  Like, this is what I'm working on. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7544.08s)]
*  So you got to like equal that or like meet me halfway. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7546.08s)]
*  I think. Yeah. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7548.08s)]
*  So I'm doing a lot of that, but really just trying to elevate what I'm already doing. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7549.08s)]
*  Just shoot more sketches, put out more shit, try different formats. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7553.08s)]
*  YouTube's in a weird place where it's like what they want is very different. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7555.08s)]
*  It's very like like sketch comedy. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7559.08s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's dead, but it's not in the forefront. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7561.08s)]
*  You know, people want to be talked to. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7563.08s)]
*  You know, they want to like you want to do stuff to a camera. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7565.08s)]
*  Like if I was doing a sketch instead of being like me and you in the sketch, I would just do like POV. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7568.08s)]
*  And then the camera is you just like talking to me because people just want to be talked to. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7575.08s)]
*  So I don't really know what the fuck is going on the Internet. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7579.08s)]
*  Like I think I do. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7581.08s)]
*  And then I post something. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7582.08s)]
*  And then a week later, it's not really that. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7583.08s)]
*  So I don't really know. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7585.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough to know. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7586.08s)]
*  It's tough to know. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7587.08s)]
*  And it's tough to know if it's just like a lull in the vibe that week of humanity or if people are studying for exams or people are taking away on vacation or something. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7588.08s)]
*  It's hard to know what's up. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7599.08s)]
*  Power outage and Little Rock. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7600.08s)]

*  Sometimes I think about going down to Austin though for a while. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7602.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7605.08s)]
*  Just because there is a sense there's an energy down there that's exciting. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7606.08s)]
*  It is exciting. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7611.08s)]
*  You know, one of my openers, Chance Willie, is moving down there from Nashville. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7612.08s)]

*  That's what I think I would probably do. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7630.08s)]
*  Just get a house or a small house or just something real. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7631.08s)]
*  Well, something. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9rrPj4s_D4&t=7634.08s)]
