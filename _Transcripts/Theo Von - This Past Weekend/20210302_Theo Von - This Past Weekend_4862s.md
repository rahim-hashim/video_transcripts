*  ability of a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=349.82s)]
*  You know, say your great-great-grandpappy or grandfather which is a way more [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=352.06s)]
*  appropriate name a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=358.90000000000003s)]

*  I'm saying uh [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=379.14s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder like our you know, our DNA can carry [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=380.94s)]
*  You know if you have a child it might have blue eyes or or green eyes or red eyes or something based on what the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=384.18s)]
*  parents have [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=390.18s)]

*  Undeveloped film [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=408.14s)]

*  You know mature enough or does dissipate enough and and it affects you somehow [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, I wonder like say if somebody tickled your great-great-grandmother, but she was in a coma or something [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=425.58s)]
*  You know when she died, you know, she was in a crazy accident with the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  Something simple like a hillside and a wagon wheel [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, there wasn't a lot of hopper of unique accidents back then [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=442.46000000000004s)]

*  People would take you know, it's one of her nephew her little cousins or somebody an [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=454.66s)]
*  Intern or some pervert or somebody would come in and tickle her at night [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=459.22s)]
*  Just [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=463.3s)]
*  Kind of getting off on the fact that you could tickle a cut that tickled the coma toast [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=464.5s)]
*  Without any recourse without even hearing a giggle, but knowing that that tickle was getting stored into her body [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=470.78s)]
*  Into her frame into the minutia of her [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=477.54s)]
*  You know into the textiles into the damn [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=481.3s)]

*  just [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=900.1s)]
*  Potato or something. Let me see what it says the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=901.74s)]
*  the mr. Potato head [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=906.42s)]
*  Article yeah, I said mr. Potato head is now just gonna be potato head [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=910.34s)]
*  That's the thing a gender neutral version of the toy [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=917.54s)]
*  They will be offering a gender neutral version of the toy alongside the traditional. Oh, so they're keeping the mr. And mrs. Potato head [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=922.66s)]
*  And [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=933.7s)]
*  People was a some people were upset about I don't think the people were that upset about it [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=935.42s)]
*  But and they said they say online [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=938.74s)]
*  Which is basically a dangerous place to be if you like to have any peace in your life [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=942.06s)]
*  But I was thinking like well a potato first of all is male they have male and female characteristics in it [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=949.86s)]
*  So you got to know they are self pollinators. I've had this article say meaning that every individual [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=956.98s)]
*  Potato plant possesses both male and female flowers for reproduction [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=963.62s)]
*  So a potato has already got that dual citizenship, you know when it comes to crotch [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=969.14s)]
*  So, yeah, why not [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=977.14s)]
*  Why not again? Well, my question is what what? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=979.1800000000001s)]

*  Still wants to play with a potato [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=984.58s)]
*  You can't get a kid excited by giving them a damn potod anymore [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=988.1s)]
*  So that kid's not even mentally. Well, let's be honest [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=993.34s)]

*  Then I forget that I have that plan the next day comes I don't run but my brain will remind me [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=2998.7400000000002s)]
*  Man you didn't run [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3007.7000000000003s)]
*  Hey, yeah [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3010.5800000000004s)]
*  It waits till I literally laid out you didn't run did you [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3013.54s)]
*  Or all did like hey when you're gonna run when you're gonna run, huh day two day two [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3018.66s)]
*  So I'll let myself down but it's just because I make all these rules it'd be everything [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3027.62s)]
*  I'll bite into a tomato. It's like oh salad only 30 days salad only [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3031.46s)]
*  jesus [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3037.94s)]
*  I [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3040.34s)]
*  The next morning I wake up and have a waffle, you know [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3041.38s)]
*  And there's two in a little pack, but I only have one but still [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3046.02s)]
*  My brain's like oh man, no so much for salad only, you know [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3050.82s)]
*  I guess i'll just be a glutton and just probably die early [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3055.06s)]
*  You know my so anyway, I start to not trust myself because I make I constantly make these different rules for myself [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3057.86s)]
*  That are impossible [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3065.3s)]
*  To live up to the number I make of them are important there's no [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3068.26s)]
*  That's called unrealism [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3074.34s)]
*  So when I do that then I start to not trust myself because i've made so many little rules that i've broken [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3078.1000000000004s)]
*  So but I I never stopped making the rules so there's no way I could do it [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3085.1400000000003s)]
*  Let me hear a little bit more again about what you asked so I can be clear [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3092.5800000000004s)]
*  On that deeper level man, and I find I uh, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3096.1s)]
*  I struggle with that a lot as well and I feel like a lot of that comes down to [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3099.38s)]
*  um, you know, like it's it's hard for me to trust myself sometimes man and I have uh, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3103.86s)]
*  You know, I make I make a lot of progress in my life, you know, i'm doing well, you know [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3109.3s)]
*  I provide for myself. I'm doing things that make me happy but [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3112.9s)]
*  So another place where I still have some issues about trusting myself is um [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3117.22s)]
*  You know when like I will find this i'll call like a lot of my friends in recovery and [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3121.22s)]
*  Who one thing that's interesting about people in recovery [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3127.2999999999997s)]
*  Or who have ever been in recovery or spent time in it [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3131.62s)]
*  once you [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3137.06s)]
*  Once somebody you you connect with that person you connect with them on a level [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3138.58s)]
*  It's a real level [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3143.06s)]
*  It's different than the other video game levels you're on with regular human [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3145.06s)]
*  This is you straight to bowser [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3149.46s)]
*  You know [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3154.5s)]
*  so it's uh [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3156.02s)]
*  There's just a real connection [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3158.26s)]
*  Um [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3161.14s)]
*  So I'll call a lot of my friends in recovery. I will just say hey man. Am I am I okay? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3162.1s)]
*  Is everything okay? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3167.78s)]
*  You know, just tell me everything's okay, please [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3170.26s)]
*  I'll do that man. I'll do it three times a week [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3173.62s)]
*  I'll do that man. I'll do it three times a week. Hey man, i'm okay, right? I mean out of the blue [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3176.2599999999998s)]

*  I'm okay, aren't I? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3189.8599999999997s)]
*  So I it's hard I never had I just didn't have and i'm not complaining i'm not like [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3193.54s)]
*  upset, you know i'm [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3199.8599999999997s)]
*  Sometimes I get a little perturbed but [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3201.94s)]
*  When I was young or whatever happened, I don't know. I just there was never a voice saying everything's okay [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3204.1800000000003s)]
*  Everything's gonna be okay. You're okay [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3210.1800000000003s)]
*  You're fine [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3214.26s)]
*  We're fine. Everything's gonna be fine [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3215.7000000000003s)]
*  There was a lot of other commotion where things I didn't know if they were gonna be fine [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3218.26s)]
*  So then still to this day that's like, uh, there's always still this invisible commotion going around all the time [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3222.9s)]
*  You know, um [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3231.86s)]
*  So it's hard for me to then trust myself a lot of times because I don't even know that everything's okay [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3234.42s)]
*  So if I go for two or three days without hearing man, it's okay. It's like damn [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3240.02s)]
*  I start to just not trust myself. It's like well, how could I can't make any more decisions right now [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3247.54s)]
*  I don't even know if everything's okay [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3251.94s)]
*  so I don't know if that makes any sense, bro, but [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3254.1s)]
*  It's also hard to trust yourself when you don't even you feel like you don't know yourself [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3257.06s)]
*  You know a lot of those spaces make it so hard to make decisions from [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3266.2599999999998s)]
*  Like man if I do this am I gonna be okay [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3271.54s)]
*  While other people are just doing this doing that [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3275.2999999999997s)]
*  Doing coke juggling [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3278.8199999999997s)]
*  Not no concerns [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3281.06s)]
*  Just totally fucking ripping [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3283.7799999999997s)]
*  full sin confidence [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3286.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3290.66s)]
*  But one of the byproducts is that of that is that you think sometimes thinking a lot is helpful. It's nice [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3292.74s)]
*  Your brain can be really kind of thoughtful at times because you think a lot [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3299.86s)]
*  So [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3305.86s)]
*  Um, and it gets better as you get a little bit older daddy [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3307.94s)]
*  I promise you that [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3312.02s)]
*  But the shit can be intense I think the one cure for it is something I haven't enacted [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3313.54s)]
*  Very well in my life and I do believe that it's meditation [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3317.62s)]
*  But also what do I know bro, you know what i'm saying i'm just a semi-white fam praise god, dog [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=3321.7s)]

*  My sobriety and uh [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4117.38s)]
*  Especially with covid, you know, that's like it's really hard to find meetings [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4119.7s)]
*  and um [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4127.3s)]
*  Going to these online meetings isn't the same at all [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4128.58s)]
*  So I was just looking for some tips, you know, how do I cope with my alcoholism [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4134.58s)]
*  Without being able to go to real life meetings man, I don't know i'm struggling [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4142.82s)]

*  It's easier said than done, you know what i'm saying [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4160.58s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want to be a debbie downer, but uh, I love your podcast [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4163.86s)]

*  From [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4199.54s)]
*  the recovery community [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4201.299999999999s)]
*  To reinstate meetings in person [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4204.02s)]
*  You don't have to agree with me but [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4208.66s)]
*  It is baffling to me the number of [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4214.26s)]
*  It's baffling to me the connection that is created through in-person meetings [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4219.38s)]
*  Um and how they're that is not just like a top story [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UgNjayQFA&t=4225.3s)]
