*  Trying to get it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=147.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=153.0s)]
*  I understand you go door to door. You need CPR. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=155.0s)]

*  I can't even handle the insect guy. Hey, buddy, where he, you know. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=172.0s)]
*  You know, that guy always shows up. He's like, hey, man, we're just, you know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=177.0s)]

*  You know, we'll give you forty dollars off. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=186.0s)]
*  And then he's always like, what's that behind you? Is that a wasp? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=190.0s)]
*  You know, they always try to scare you, them guys like, oh, damn, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=193.0s)]

*  And some of these companies, you know, these insect companies, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=207.0s)]
*  they'll have a guy sitting in the truck with a little drone, a little drone wasp. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=209.0s)]
*  And he'll have that bitch going. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=214.0s)]
*  And they set you up and then he's like, damn, your house is infected. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=217.0s)]
*  You know, you got bed bugs, you got bench worms. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=221.0s)]

*  You're like, what? You know, but before you know it, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=238.0s)]
*  it's eighty dollars and you got some guy spraying gas all around, you know, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=241.0s)]

*  I mean, those insect people will spray damn. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=252.0s)]
*  I saw a dude one time he was on his phone and just had the gun, the spray gun just going. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=255.0s)]
*  He left about probably seven or eight ounces of, you know, it's probably just repellent. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=261.0s)]
*  He left seven or eight ounces in a children's playroom. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=268.0s)]
*  I saw him just he was on there just stepping on the gas. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=271.0s)]
*  He was on his phone ordering something, getting him a Jimmy John or getting him a fat Sal's, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=274.0s)]
*  you know, or something or a vet, you know, getting him a little bit of butch's pizza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=282.0s)]
*  He was ordering something on the phone. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=287.0s)]
*  But, yeah, so those are people I can understand doing door to door. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Those are people I can understand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=297.0s)]
*  But when they're door to door, like, hey, we're here with the blood, you know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=300.0s)]
*  so and, you know, state blood bank or something and we're here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=308.0s)]
*  We're just seeing if anybody in the house in the home today is willing to give blood. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=312.0s)]
*  And then the guy kind of looks in my house like like like he's going to see somebody in a distance [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=315.0s)]
*  who just happened to be like, oh, you know, I got a I got extra blood on me or whatever. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=323.0s)]
*  All right. Yeah, you know, I wouldn't I was just going to play some Call of Duty, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=329.0s)]
*  but I'll drop off a pint. I'll give you half a pint. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=333.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can legally give blood or not. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=339.0s)]
*  They said I couldn't one time because I had done steroid use and they won't let you give blood. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=345.0s)]
*  So it kind of hurt my feelings a little bit, but, you know, it shouldn't hurt my feeling. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=353.0s)]
*  But when somebody's like, hey, we don't want your blood, that's a really because you got a lot of blood. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=359.0s)]
*  Somebody's like, damn, we don't want your blood. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=367.0s)]
*  Yeah, door to door salesman, that would be going door to door. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=372.0s)]
*  They don't have as much of it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=378.0s)]
*  You know, when I was young, the egg man would come and he'd come and he'd bring, you know, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=381.0s)]
*  he'd show you a thing of eggs. You want some eggs, you know? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=385.0s)]
*  And my mom would be like, get off, get off our porch. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=390.0s)]
*  You fucking pervert. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=393.0s)]
*  Because sometimes he'd be looking in the windows. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=396.0s)]
*  Sometimes he'd just be looking at he wouldn't even have any eggs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=398.0s)]
*  He's like, dude, are you selling eggs or are you just a peeping Tom? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=401.0s)]
*  You know, like, are you you don't have any eggs. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=406.0s)]
*  So what are you doing here? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=411.0s)]

*  They had door to door. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=419.0s)]
*  Oh, the people would do the magazines and it was like a scam, you know. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=423.0s)]
*  They come, they'd be like dancing on your porch like, hey, don't you want a copy of this magazine? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=427.0s)]
*  You know, and it would be a scam. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=433.0s)]

*  You'd pay the guy, you would never see the magazines. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=456.0s)]

*  I feel a little nervous. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=593.0s)]
*  I feel kind of nervous today. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=594.0s)]
*  So that's OK. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=599.0s)]
*  I'm just going to say that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=600.0s)]
*  You know, and that's OK. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=602.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to just fill you in what's going on with with with me recently. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=606.0s)]
*  Just tell you what I've been up to. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=610.0s)]
*  And yes, I feel like I'm just forgetting how to do this, but that's OK. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=612.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=617.0s)]
*  It's just a little bit of a struggle. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=618.0s)]
*  I'm doing a solo episode. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=620.0s)]
*  I haven't done it in a while. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=621.0s)]
*  And so I'm really grateful. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=623.0s)]
*  I was really excited to be able to sit here and I want to get into some calls in a little bit. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=624.0s)]
*  I just got back. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=632.0s)]
*  I went to UFC. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=633.0s)]
*  That was really cool. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=634.0s)]
*  But one thing I did really recently that was. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=635.0s)]
*  That was just divine. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=639.0s)]
*  And I mean, you could just go to the UFC and do a solo episode. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=642.0s)]
*  And I mean, you could just God, it was just damn divine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=647.0s)]
*  I mean, you could feel the Lord just just touching you while you were watching it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=654.0s)]
*  And it was the rodeo. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=658.0s)]
*  I went to the rodeo recently, I went to the Franklin rodeo and it was in Franklin, Tennessee. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=661.0s)]
*  And then the rodeo, you think it's going to be a, you know, a lot of people spit and dip and. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=666.0s)]
*  And even women doing it, you'll have a woman, she'll have it, you know. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=674.0s)]
*  She'll have a hit of Copenhagen tucked up. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=679.0s)]
*  You know, somebody they're tough. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=682.0s)]
*  They'll tuck, they'll tuck a hit of Hagen right up in their lab. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=684.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=687.0s)]
*  They don't. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=688.0s)]
*  You're like, man, which where's she spitting from? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=689.0s)]
*  You know, it's tough. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=692.0s)]
*  So it can be a unique lot out there, but. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=693.0s)]
*  Or a unique lot of people that go to watch rodeo. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=697.0s)]
*  But it was unbelievably entertaining. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=699.0s)]
*  I had just I'd forgotten how good it was. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=702.0s)]
*  You know, I think I'd only been once and. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=706.0s)]
*  And I had pink eyes, so I couldn't even see that good. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=711.0s)]
*  I remember I think my mom took us once and. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=714.0s)]
*  And yeah, so I was, you know. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=718.0s)]
*  Only have, you know, I was I was infected at the time, so I couldn't see good, but it was unbelievable. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=722.0s)]
*  I went to the Franklin rodeo. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=728.0s)]
*  And at one point, there's this event where they bring out all of these. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=730.0s)]
*  They bring children out of the stands and they they tie like ribbons to. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=735.0s)]
*  The tail of. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=741.0s)]
*  Or they put like a ribbon onto the end of a sheep and they let the sheep run and all these kids just chase these sheep trying to get the ribbon off of the tail. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=746.0s)]
*  It's just. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=755.0s)]
*  And then you have. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=756.0s)]
*  And then you have. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=758.0s)]
*  There's some calf like roping and stuff, some of that's kind of intense if you're kind of like very, you know, pretty sensitive, it can be maybe a little bit intense. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=761.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, you'll see they'll be lasso and sometimes they'll. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=770.0s)]
*  You'll see milk fly out of some, you know, you'll see a little bit of a. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=776.0s)]
*  You'll see they'll be lasso and sometimes they'll. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=780.0s)]
*  You'll see milk fly out of some, you know, you're like, damn, was that milk and your dad's like, cover your eyes. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=784.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to be on this website, but they had a horse. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=791.0s)]
*  There's one point where they show some of this man had trained a horse and the horse stands up on his legs, brother. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=795.0s)]
*  And I've never seen this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=802.0s)]
*  And this horse, I don't know if he was like a business or like a business horse or if he's one of the. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=804.0s)]
*  You know, if he I don't know how he got his skill set, really. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=810.0s)]
*  But he stood up on his legs, like in the middle of the arena, and then he walked. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=815.0s)]
*  Out of the arena. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=820.0s)]
*  On his legs, a horse. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=823.0s)]
*  And I'd never seen it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=826.0s)]
*  But it blew my mind anyway, if you get a chance to go see a rodeo, I totally recommend it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=828.0s)]
*  I just I'd forgotten how great it was, how interesting it was, the different amounts of talent you get to cheer for people. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=835.0s)]
*  They got some hard cores out there, too. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=844.0s)]
*  I mean, they got some women out. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=847.0s)]
*  They got some strong, you know, men and women. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=849.0s)]
*  They got some people that are. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=853.0s)]
*  They'll they got some people that will fucking. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=856.0s)]
*  They'll shake your fucking hand, you know. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=861.0s)]
*  They will shake your hand. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=865.0s)]
*  So they have some people like that out there. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=868.0s)]
*  But yeah, it was amazing. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=871.0s)]
*  I just want to recommend the rodeo if you haven't been going and doing things that are interesting or you're thinking, oh, there's nothing in my area. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=872.0s)]
*  Or if you just haven't been to a rodeo in a long time, I want to recommend the rodeo. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=879.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=886.0s)]
*  We had the we had the Roseanne, our Roseanne episode got taken down. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=887.0s)]
*  Do a little bit of business with you guys here. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=893.0s)]
*  Our Roseanne episode got taken down. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=897.0s)]
*  And we got strikes on YouTube. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=901.0s)]
*  A strike. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=904.0s)]
*  And we couldn't post for a week. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=905.0s)]
*  Those were the rules. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=906.0s)]
*  And at first, I was really shocked. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=910.0s)]
*  You know, I believe that I believe that what Roseanne said was satire. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=912.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=916.0s)]
*  I believe that wholeheartedly. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=917.0s)]
*  I believe that she is a comedian. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=919.0s)]
*  I know she's a comedian. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=922.0s)]
*  We're having a satiric. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=923.0s)]
*  We're having a conversation. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=924.0s)]
*  She was being satirical to me. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=925.0s)]
*  Very evident. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=927.0s)]
*  Now, YouTube has their own policies. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=929.0s)]
*  They have hate speech policies. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=931.0s)]
*  And that's what we got our strike for was hate speech. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=932.0s)]
*  And I think I was I was kind of offended by that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=941.0s)]
*  You know, I thought I didn't think that that was I didn't think that it was fair. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=945.0s)]
*  And I think that that was fair for me. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=951.0s)]
*  And I think that that was fair for you. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=953.0s)]
*  I didn't think that it was fair. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=955.0s)]
*  And I think the toughest part was there's no communication. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=957.0s)]
*  You don't get to communicate with YouTube really about it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=962.0s)]
*  Right. They kind of this ruling comes from like a place you can't or people you can't communicate with or access. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=966.0s)]
*  And then that's how they do it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=971.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=974.0s)]
*  And now I understand they have their policies and they have to do their best to uphold their policies. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=975.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=980.0s)]
*  And I'm thankful to YouTube. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=981.0s)]
*  I'm very grateful that it exists. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=983.0s)]
*  Right. Because I have a place to speak from. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=986.0s)]
*  You know, I have a platform from which to talk and and a place to host a show. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=991.0s)]
*  Like, I'm very grateful for that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=997.0s)]
*  Truly am. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=999.0s)]
*  But yeah, I think the tough part was just that it felt like there was no communication about it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1002.0s)]
*  It was just like, this is what it is. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1006.0s)]
*  And. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  And I understand that's their policies. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  But I think there was there should be I feel like you should have some conversation about it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1015.0s)]
*  Because they call for YouTube, they call you like partners, right? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1023.0s)]
*  You're like, we're partners. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  You know, because I'm not an employee of YouTube, but I'm a partner. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1031.0s)]
*  That's what they they call it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1036.0s)]
*  You know that you're a partner, YouTube partner. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I just felt like if I'm a partner, then let's at least have a discussion with me about what's going on. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  So you can hear what I'm you can hear what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  You know, so I think that was the toughest part. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1056.0s)]
*  I just felt like it was kind of I felt like there was no chance for me to. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  Speak or share what I was thinking or feeling. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1066.0s)]
*  And maybe that's just how it is. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  You know, that's business. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1071.0s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1073.0s)]
*  I had some different feelings about it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  You know, I also have to take into account that I want to be able to have a show. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  I want to be able to connect with people and. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1081.0s)]
*  And. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  And just times are different. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  You know, people could say, well, you can still have your voice, even if you lose a channel or your social media gets taken down, you still have your own voice, which is true. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1089.0s)]
*  But times have changed. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1101.0s)]
*  You know, it's like it's not just a soapbox in your neighborhood anymore in your tribe. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  You know, your people are communicating with a lot more people at once. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1109.0s)]
*  And on bigger levels or different levels. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1112.0s)]
*  But when you communicate something out in social media on YouTube, it's accessible to more people. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  So it's not like you're just standing on your soapbox, you know, in a town hall or something. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1123.0s)]
*  So it's really like YouTube has kind of become like paper, like they're the paper. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  You know, all these social media platforms, they're the paper. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1137.0s)]
*  And it's almost sometimes it feels like, well, the paper. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1139.0s)]
*  Gets to determine what's written on it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1143.0s)]
*  Whereas it used to feel more like, hey, you can write what you want on this paper and deal with people's and deal with consequences or interpretations of it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1146.0s)]
*  But now it's sometimes it feels like, well, if you. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1157.0s)]
*  Put something on this paper. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1160.0s)]
*  The paper. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  Is the paper. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  And so now, when you put something on this paper, the paper. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  Is now determining what you're even allowed to. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  It's like as if a piece of paper you're writing stuff on it and the paper was able to edit as you're writing. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1174.0s)]
*  So I don't know if that makes any sense, but. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's just an interesting time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  What's crazy was that. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1189.0s)]
*  When the episode got took and down, I believe that it should be able to live somewhere, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  I believe that it was a great episode. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  I was really grateful to be be able to talk with, you know, a real matriarch matriarch. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  Yeah, a real matriarch of comedy. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1207.0s)]
*  You know, she is. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1210.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1213.0s)]
*  She there's nobody like Roseanne. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1215.0s)]
*  You know, and I know she's had a lot of like things that have come at her over the years, a lot of. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1219.0s)]
*  You know, she always makes controversy. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1225.0s)]
*  She always does. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  Sometimes it seems like it's too much for sure. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1231.0s)]
*  Other times it seems like. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  What you would expect out of a comedian out of a. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  An instigator, you know, it's kind of what you would expect. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1242.0s)]
*  Because that's what that's what challenges comedians in the first place. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1245.0s)]
*  Like, oh, I can say this. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1249.0s)]
*  I can't say this. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1250.0s)]
*  How do I. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1251.0s)]
*  You know, how do I mill around this area? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1253.0s)]
*  Of taboo. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1260.0s)]
*  Whatever the taboo is. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1261.0s)]
*  But then, so then I put the episode on to Twitter. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1266.0s)]
*  Because. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1271.0s)]
*  They allow longer form episodes now or longer video on there. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1272.0s)]
*  And then Elon Musk, the frickin alien liaison, you know. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1277.0s)]
*  He. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1285.0s)]
*  He shared it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1287.0s)]
*  And so that went. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1289.0s)]
*  I mean, that was unbelievable that, you know, just the fact that he did it, you know. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1291.0s)]
*  And whatever you think about Elon, you know, or whatever you think about Elon, you know, or whatever you think about Elon. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1297.0s)]
*  Or whatever you, you know, that's not it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1302.0s)]
*  That that isn't that's not what I'm thinking about. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1303.0s)]
*  I'm just thinking how fat here was like a man who's like an influential man. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1305.0s)]
*  And he's sharing, you know, me and Roseanne and I having a conversation. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1310.0s)]
*  So it was just pretty fascinating. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  The whole experience is kind of fascinating. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1319.0s)]
*  You know, I think I was bummed out because I feel like I've done a lot of like neat work on YouTube and I try and show up every week for the channel. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1322.0s)]
*  And, yeah, so I think that's what that's what it was like. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1329.0s)]
*  If we're partners, have a discussion. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1335.0s)]
*  At least someone speak to me. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1338.0s)]
*  But that's that's their it's their it's their platform. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1343.0s)]
*  And those are that's how that's their rules. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of times we have to play within the rules. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1352.0s)]
*  You know, if I walk on a basketball court, I I know the rules, you know, and that's the rules. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1357.0s)]

*  You're not going to hurt anybody's feelings. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  But you want to try different ones until you get one that you feel like is helping you navigate some things. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1403.0s)]

*  BetterHelp can help. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1457.0s)]
*  Profiling, surveillance, data harvesting. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1459.0s)]
*  There are lots of things not to like about tech giants. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  But what can you actually do about it when you rely on so many other products? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1470.0s)]
*  Well, the good news is it doesn't take much for you to take a stand. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1472.0s)]
*  For less than $7 per month you can join me and fight back against big tech by using Express, Vimeo, and Google. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  By using ExpressVPN. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1488.0s)]
*  ExpressVPN helps you anonymize, make anonymous much of your online presence by hiding your IP address. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  Your IP address is a unique identifier that every device has that allows big tech to match your activity back to you. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1499.0s)]
*  That's why I use ExpressVPN on all my devices. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  To make it much more difficult for them to exploit my data for their own profits. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1511.0s)]
*  And the best part is how easy it is to use ExpressVPN or the ExpressVPN app. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1516.0s)]
*  I just tap one button on my phone or computer to turn it on. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1523.0s)]
*  And that's all it takes to keep people out of my business. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  So if you don't like big tech tracking you and selling your personal data for profit. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1530.0s)]

*  What else? God, I don't know why I feel nervous today, man. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1552.0s)]
*  I had a good time. I got to go to Utah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1560.0s)]
*  And they have a water shortage over there. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1562.0s)]
*  So if you got a bucket of water or something, man, you get two buckets of water. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  You'll get a date with the prom queen over there. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1571.0s)]
*  You know, if you're appropriately aged. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1575.0s)]
*  Two buckets of water, homie. They'll do, you know. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  If you're in southern Utah, they got a drought. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  If you start crying, somebody come up and hold a plant right under you. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  Like, hey, buddy, I know you're depressed, but I got this bougainvillea that needs some help. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1590.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a drought. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1597.0s)]
*  And I thought it was interesting. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  Like in this town, we did a show in Springdale, Utah, and it was beautiful. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1602.0s)]
*  I'd never done this. It was like outdoors. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1607.0s)]
*  And there was, you know, just nature, big chunks of, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1609.0s)]
*  what is it, like a big chunk of nature. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1615.0s)]
*  It's like where nature raises their hand kind of mountains. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1625.0s)]
*  They have huge mountains. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1628.0s)]
*  And what is that mountain range? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1631.0s)]
*  Southern Utah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  And that mountain range is the Wasatch range, I think. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1640.0s)]
*  And it goes over there to Mount Zion Park. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1645.0s)]
*  And it's just stunning. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  We had a show over there. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1651.0s)]
*  And my brother lives in that area, and they only have so much water. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1653.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, you got to, you know, you got to ask for help. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1657.0s)]
*  If you need water, they don't have water. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  If you need water, you, they don't, people don't have it. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1668.0s)]
*  You know, people just don't. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1674.0s)]
*  I mean, you, I would find myself licking my hands and then rubbing it in my eyes [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1676.0s)]
*  so I could still blink. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1681.0s)]
*  Like you get dehydrated there pretty easily. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1683.0s)]
*  So they have like water shares, it's called, in the area where if you move, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  you can't build a new home there unless you have water shares. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1694.0s)]
*  And that's like your allotment of water. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1699.0s)]
*  And my brother, in the morning, they go and they turn, they go in different parts of their town, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1704.0s)]
*  and they have to turn these different valves, and then they get their share of water. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1709.0s)]
*  So it's pretty, like we went for a ride and we turned a valve, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1715.0s)]
*  and then we went to another part and turned another one, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1721.0s)]
*  and then went to another place and turned another one. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1724.0s)]
*  And at that time, you're like unleashing the water, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  and then you get back home and the water is just coming down the street like in this little, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1731.0s)]
*  like cement ravine, and you're getting like your allotment of water for the week or month. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1736.0s)]
*  I thought that was pretty cool. I'd never seen it before. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1745.0s)]
*  But the people are damn dehydrated there, you know. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  You got to, you know, they're sharing water, every ounce is accounted for in that area. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1751.0s)]
*  You'll tell a neighbor, hey, can you flush your toilet? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1756.0s)]
*  Because we want to make some soup, you know. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1759.0s)]
*  It's just they don't have, they don't have a lot to go around. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1765.0s)]
*  So what else do I want to talk to you guys about? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1771.0s)]
*  I went and did Kill Tony. That was amazing. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  If you haven't seen Kill Tony, it's unbelievable. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1780.0s)]
*  I think it's unbelievable what they put together there. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  It's like the realest. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1789.0s)]
*  I mean, they have people that get up to get up and do one minute of comedy, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  have your name pulled out of a hat. It's so hard to do. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  One minute is hard to do because it's like you can't really go into a story. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1802.0s)]
*  So you kind of have to just tell a couple of jokes. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  But it's just so much pressure. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1816.0s)]
*  And then it's crazy because the performer gets one minute and they know that's what they get. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  But then Tony gets two thousand minutes if he wants to rip them to shreds. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1824.0s)]
*  And they just have a beautiful band there. Somebody is blind. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  So that's, you know, anytime you got a blind guy, that's a fucking crystal ball right there. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1835.0s)]
*  That's the original crystal ball. Do you rub on a blind guy until he says something? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1842.0s)]
*  And if that, you know, I mean, that's that's dark magic, baby. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1848.0s)]
*  If you rub on a blind until they just whatever they say, and then that's that's the original crystal ball right there. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1855.0s)]
*  But if you haven't seen Kill Tony, I was just it just blew my mind how great it was. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1864.0s)]
*  And what I just forget kind of. And it's just if you never watch it, you just have to watch it sometime. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1868.0s)]
*  So what else did I want to say? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1876.0s)]
*  I went to Tampa, had a couple of good shows in Tampa. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1879.0s)]
*  One night was a little tough, I thought. Same for Vegas. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  One night was a little tough. You know, I think I've been feeling all I feel. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1886.0s)]
*  I think what I'm realizing, what I feel, I feel this feel a lot of pressure today. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1890.0s)]
*  And I know there's no pressure by you guys. It's just pressure from my own self, I guess. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1896.0s)]
*  You know, I just feel as the podcast has gotten busier, I feel more. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1902.0s)]
*  I guess I feel more like. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1911.0s)]
*  Like, how do I do it? Like that I have to do it, that I have to do it perfectly. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1916.0s)]
*  You know, that's what I feel like. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1926.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I feel like since there's more people that have been tuning in that I have to do it perfectly. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1930.0s)]
*  So that's OK. It's a normal probably thing that people feel that way. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1940.0s)]
*  Yes, I'm just taking you guys through, I guess, some of my thoughts right now. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1949.0s)]
*  But I can't do it perfectly. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1952.0s)]
*  You know, I can't do it perfectly. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1959.0s)]
*  So I can't, I have to be careful not to leave myself in that space where I'm putting that much pressure on myself. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1961.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm just going to do it to the best of my ability. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1970.0s)]
*  That's what I'm going to do. And I know it's easy for me to say that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1976.0s)]
*  But yeah, for some reason, I just have a lot of that feeling like I just have. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1979.0s)]
*  I think that's that's some of the nervousness that that is have feel like this feeling of just that I have to do this perfectly. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1984.0s)]
*  And that's I don't know what that is, but it's it feels like a pressure. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=1992.0s)]
*  And I know nobody's putting that pressure on me. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2001.0s)]
*  It's just in my own head. And some of that was probably natural, but I just wanted to speak that out loud. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2004.0s)]
*  So I'm just conscious of what I'm feeling instead of just feeling something and not trying to know what it is. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2009.0s)]
*  But let's get into some calls, man. We had some that came in. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2019.0s)]
*  As always, the hotline is 985-664-9503. The Baja. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2022.0s)]
*  I've been working on that just even turned down in the Baja. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2029.0s)]
*  Baja soda. Baja soda. Minnesota. Yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2032.0s)]

*  That's what happens on me with this shirt on. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2074.0s)]
*  Anything's possible. You got to identify whatever you want. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2078.0s)]
*  That's the thing, bro. You could, you know. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2083.0s)]
*  You could chase somebody's fucking you could chase a squirrel. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2088.0s)]

*  What else we got here? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2178.0s)]
*  Hey, Theo. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2183.0s)]
*  Recently, I was at the OBGYN, the ladies doctor. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2186.0s)]
*  I recently miscarried. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  And, you know, you have to go for a couple of appointments afterward. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2197.0s)]
*  And I happened to have been listening to your and Stargro's podcast. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  And the doctor overheard where you prefer to call the ladies parts, cooter. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2210.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2219.0s)]
*  Cooter, baby, I know what you're saying. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  And that's, yeah, because cooter, you know, people know what it is, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2222.0s)]
*  but you could also pretend, hey, it could be something else, you know. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2230.0s)]
*  Oh, man, we were, we just saw a cooter run by here, you know. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2233.0s)]
*  Well, what is that a cooter? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2238.0s)]
*  You know, you can almost pretend. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2240.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2241.0s)]
*  My cousin. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2243.0s)]
*  You just got attacked by a cooter. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2246.0s)]
*  Yeah, just there's I think, you know, it's still enough of the masking where you don't have to, you know, say, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2250.0s)]
*  you know what I'm talking about. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2262.0s)]
*  So onward. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2265.0s)]
*  Instead of the other word that starts with a P. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2271.0s)]
*  And I just said it to I'm going to say it again real quick. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2272.0s)]
*  I'm going to pretend like I'm not saying it, but OK, onward. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2274.0s)]
*  And she thought that it was absolutely one of the funniest things she had ever heard. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2279.0s)]
*  And then she asked what you would prefer to call the male equivalent. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2287.0s)]
*  And I realized I didn't know what you would prefer to call it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2294.0s)]
*  That deaf leopard, homie. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2299.0s)]
*  That's what I call it. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2301.0s)]
*  That deaf leopard, baby. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2302.0s)]
*  That skeet pony. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2306.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2308.0s)]
*  That bus knuckle. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2312.0s)]
*  I think those are good terms for it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2315.0s)]
*  That sperm randle, they'll call it sometimes. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2319.0s)]
*  Daddy got that sperm randle on him. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2322.0s)]
*  What else people call it? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2326.0s)]
*  The that batter twig. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2328.0s)]
*  Somebody say let me break you off a little something. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  Let me break you off half a tablespoon out this batter twig. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2334.0s)]
*  I would say wiener as well. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2338.0s)]
*  You know, I think people say wiener and I think wiener is good. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2341.0s)]
*  You can say it near children if you yell at somebody to suck my wiener. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2350.0s)]
*  It almost seems like, oh, this guy kind of means it because everybody says SMD, right? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2356.0s)]
*  But if you say, oh, my wiener, I think people are more into it. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2363.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2368.0s)]
*  I watched that Joey Chestnut, that guy, that Frank, that fucking, that dude is a damn Frank pony, huh? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2369.0s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2378.0s)]
*  And that dude just, he's that real boner, homie. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2379.0s)]
*  He'll throw them, he'll just guzzle them Franks. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2383.0s)]
*  God, how many gay dudes watch the Nathan's hot dog eating contest? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2387.0s)]
*  I mean, it must be, it must be like when people do those Game of Thrones viewing parties. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2399.0s)]
*  There's no way that in gay culture that isn't a huge thing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2405.0s)]
*  That should be on pay-per-view. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2409.0s)]
*  At every gay club, I feel like there's no, it would, it should be the biggest night at the gay club. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2415.0s)]
*  It's like the Super Bowl, it feels like. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2423.0s)]
*  Some dude, right? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2426.0s)]
*  Yammering down 67 Franks, bro. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2429.0s)]
*  That'll, I mean, that'll, if you, I think if you are gay and around, I think that will excite you. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2434.0s)]
*  Well, I would think so. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2444.0s)]
*  So anyway, just thinking about it, I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2449.0s)]
*  But yeah, that's what I think I would call it probably. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2453.0s)]
*  And I think I would call it probably wiener. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2457.0s)]
*  That cooter bridge too. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2462.0s)]
*  Because a lot of times if you're making love to somebody and you look down, your wiener just looks like a bridge between you and cooter. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2465.0s)]
*  You know, if you even had like little characters, you could put them on it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2481.0s)]
*  A hunting we will go, a hunting we. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2486.0s)]
*  Or, you know, I don't know what, you could do different music, I guess. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2492.0s)]
*  But yeah, Joey Chestnut, damn, he rumbled down in Franks, boy. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2495.0s)]
*  And then he's wet. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2501.0s)]
*  He's just like his all, it's all in his shirt and chest. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2502.0s)]

*  South Bend, and I've been over there to Mishawaka as well. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2801.0s)]

*  And I got stuck in there for a couple days with him. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=2818.0s)]

*  And then we tried a threesome with another dude. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3497.0s)]
*  And it turns out I kind of like dude. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3501.0s)]
*  So we're thinking about going our separate ways. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3502.0s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3505.0s)]
*  Well, y'all gay, bro. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3508.0s)]
*  You know, and that's that's great, man. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3514.0s)]
*  You know that you're gay. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3518.0s)]
*  That's because the craziest thing is when people don't know. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3521.0s)]
*  When people don't know they gay. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3526.0s)]
*  They they find themselves doing stuff and wondering why they're doing it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3529.0s)]
*  They'll go lay on top of a man or something for a few minutes and like, what the fuck are they? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3535.0s)]
*  And they but they don't know it. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3540.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes people don't know they're gay. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3542.0s)]
*  And so at least you guys have figured out, I believe there's a lot of. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3546.0s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3552.0s)]
*  I don't know if I want to say incoherent gays out there, but people that are gay that do not know they are gay. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3556.0s)]
*  They're almost like ghost. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3567.0s)]
*  Like ghost gays or whatever. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3570.0s)]
*  But I think more incoherent gays because they are gay, but they do not know it. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3572.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3580.0s)]
*  You have a man you put you put him in a wiener shed or whatever. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  He'll sit in there for four fucking hours. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3585.0s)]
*  But then he'll come out talking about his wife, but he didn't he didn't he thinking, hey, why been in there for four hours? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3588.0s)]
*  And that wiener said, boy, that's gay and boy. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3595.0s)]
*  So congrats, congratulations, brother. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3599.0s)]
*  I'm happy for you guys. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3605.0s)]
*  What else? My buddy Ernest fell off the stage. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3609.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3612.0s)]
*  It's a great tick tock. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3613.0s)]
*  It was Morgan Wallen, Nellie Ernest. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3615.0s)]
*  There was a show and Ernest tried to throw this rose. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3617.0s)]
*  They have a beautiful song called Flower Shops. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3621.0s)]
*  And he tried to throw a rose like as far as anybody's ever thrown a rose before. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3626.0s)]
*  And and he just, you know, he put hey, he put it all into it. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3633.0s)]
*  He used to pitch at Lipscomb. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3639.0s)]
*  He used to pitch at Lipscomb. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3641.0s)]
*  And this one was a little outside. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3643.0s)]
*  What else do we got? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3649.0s)]
*  Let's say let's take one or two more calls from you guys, man. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3650.0s)]
*  You can always hit the hotline nine eight five six six four nine five zero three. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3654.0s)]
*  Let me know what's going on with you. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3657.0s)]
*  Some exciting guests that we have coming up. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3661.0s)]
*  A lot of excitement in the air. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3665.0s)]
*  So hello, folks, Larry in upstate New York. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3667.0s)]
*  What's up, Larry? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3673.0s)]
*  Just listen to the most recent broadcast on Gura, Tom Gura and Phil Vaughn. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3676.0s)]
*  And you guys are talking about Guinness Book Records and that Tom ever want to have like a thing where he could do the set of records. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3685.0s)]
*  And it's funny you're talking about this because I happen to have thought about that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3695.0s)]
*  And my thing I would like to do is the longest P, the longest urine taken steadily straight constant stream, longest time. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3700.0s)]
*  They may already have somebody in there. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, look, I think that's a beautiful suggestion. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3715.0s)]
*  Doing the longest P is beautiful for Tom Segura and and Bert Kreischer. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3717.0s)]
*  What would be a good Guinness record for them? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3724.0s)]
*  Maybe longest sandwich. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3728.0s)]
*  You know, seeing both of them start at the opposite end of a different sandwich and eat their way as far as they could and try to meet in the middle. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3732.0s)]
*  Or just eat a long sandwich together. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3741.0s)]
*  The other. Sorry. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3743.0s)]
*  The first way sounds a little bit. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3744.0s)]
*  Yeah, but just eat. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3746.0s)]
*  Yeah, just eat. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3749.0s)]
*  Eat the world's longest sandwich. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3750.0s)]
*  The longest two men have ever stood bare chested pressing their chests against each other. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3752.0s)]
*  I could see them doing that. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3757.0s)]
*  What else could I see time and Bert doing for a Guinness record? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  Maybe the longest sentence. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3766.0s)]
*  You know, Bert can get into some long sentences, so maybe if he started a sentence and just tried to go as far as anybody's ever gone, but also making sure that the sentence makes sense. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3768.0s)]
*  So that would be really, really interesting. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3778.0s)]
*  What else? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3782.0s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3784.0s)]
*  I love to throw that out to you guys. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3785.0s)]
*  What would be some really neat Guinness records to try and set some rare ones? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3786.0s)]
*  I think the longest maybe if you filled if you fill your mouth with lump crab meat and ran like ran like did, you know, whoever could run the farthest with a mouthful of LCM baby lump crab meat. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3791.0s)]
*  I think that would be quite a work of art. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3810.0s)]
*  Yeah, but there's some nice thoughts, man. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3815.0s)]
*  Good to think out loud and be having my brain work. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3817.0s)]
*  That makes me feel good when my brain is active. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3820.0s)]
*  Let me feel warm. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3825.0s)]

*  Get in there and clean up, baby. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3851.0s)]
*  But yeah, bro, I'm just small. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3853.0s)]
*  The anniversary of my father. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3858.0s)]
*  He, you know, he recently passed away about two years ago and accomplished a lot, you know, in the time that he's gone. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3860.0s)]
*  And it's been a little rough because, you know, he hasn't really I didn't really get a chance to show him everything, you know, that I've been able to accomplish, you know. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3870.0s)]
*  But just feel a little down about Bill. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3881.0s)]
*  And, you know, I know you've been through some of the struggles with I don't really know my father. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3885.0s)]
*  I knew him. I knew him well, but not well enough, you know. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3891.0s)]
*  So I just want to know if you have any advice about that deal. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3894.0s)]
*  Just feeling a little down about my pops with all but appreciate you, man. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3900.0s)]

*  And I'm sorry that he's not here with you anymore. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3918.0s)]
*  You know, there's. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3924.0s)]
*  I think about this a lot. I think about that your heartbeat, like if you want to feel your father, you can put your heart, you can put your hand on your heartbeat. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3929.0s)]
*  Because he made that beat he and your mother. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3941.0s)]
*  They remixed a human. That's how that that's how it works. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3945.0s)]
*  They they cut a track and that was you. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3951.0s)]
*  But your heartbeat is it's their heartbeats. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3955.0s)]
*  So that's the that's your first step. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3961.0s)]
*  He's he's in you. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3964.0s)]
*  You know, I can put my I can put my hand on my heart and I can feel a beat that my father started that his father started. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3967.0s)]
*  It's such. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3975.0s)]
*  That's why when I think we have those feelings of pride, I think we have those feelings of pride. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3978.0s)]
*  I think we have those feelings of pride. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3982.0s)]
*  I mean, it'll bring tears to your eyes sometimes. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3985.0s)]
*  You know, as a young man, if you know, sometimes especially you ask yourself, why did you do that? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3989.0s)]
*  And you know, you're always like, I'm proud of you. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3993.0s)]
*  You're always like, I'm proud of you. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3996.0s)]
*  And you have this feeling of pride. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=3999.0s)]

*  And you're always like, I'm proud of you. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4006.0s)]
*  And you're always like, I'm proud of you. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4009.0s)]
*  You know, as a young man, if you know, sometimes especially you ask yourself, like, is my is my father proud of me? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4012.0s)]
*  Man, that's the that is the. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4017.0s)]
*  There's nothing sharper than that edge in a man. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4022.0s)]
*  Even the craziest thing is, even if you didn't even know your father. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4031.0s)]
*  You know, I can relate. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4038.0s)]
*  I didn't have enough moments with my father that would help us know each other well enough as humans and as men. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4039.0s)]
*  I had some experiences, but I didn't have as many conversations and like intimate connections, you know, or sentimental connections, because he was passing away as I was just coming into my teenagers years and stuff. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4046.0s)]
*  So I can just relate. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4061.0s)]
*  I can just relate in that sense. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4063.0s)]
*  And it's crazy that you just want your dad to be proud of you. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4069.0s)]
*  There's nothing else a guy wants. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4073.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I bear. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4077.0s)]
*  You know, I know my father's son, but not a lot. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4079.0s)]
*  But all I just that question will hit me sometimes, man, I just hope he was proud of me. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4083.0s)]
*  So I just want to tell you that your dad's real proud of you, bro. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4091.0s)]
*  And. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4094.0s)]
*  Yeah, and he put that beating you, man. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4098.0s)]
*  That's his heartbeat. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4099.0s)]
*  So if you want to feel your dad, you want to feel his that's his sound. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4102.0s)]
*  That sound started with him. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4105.0s)]
*  I mean, you just a sample track on me. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4110.0s)]
*  We all are. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4113.0s)]
*  But I know he's proud of you, man. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4116.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry that he's gone, but he's living. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4122.0s)]
*  He's through you. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4124.0s)]
*  When you smile, he smiles. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4126.0s)]
*  That's his smile. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4129.0s)]
*  When you see something beautiful, he sees something beautiful. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4132.0s)]
*  And when you do good. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4138.0s)]
*  And probably even when you don't, man, he's he's proud of you. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4142.0s)]
*  So just keep your head up on me and know that you're not alone, you know, and other ways you can get you can live vicariously. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4149.0s)]
*  And we like. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4158.0s)]
*  You know, when you interact with a mentor, a male mentor of yours. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4160.0s)]
*  And you let them know, hey, I really appreciate this. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4165.0s)]
*  I appreciate your outlooks and your thoughts, you know, if you do. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4168.0s)]
*  That's a way to get a little bit of fatherhood from someone else. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4174.0s)]
*  It's interesting. It's like. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4179.0s)]
*  You know, maybe if you see a young man, he's trying to do something for his father, but he can't do it or he can't afford it or he can't help. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4182.0s)]
*  If you step in there and help, that's you doing something for a father. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4188.0s)]
*  And it may not be your father, but you are doing something for that position of of of a father. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4194.0s)]
*  You are being of assistance to a father. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4201.0s)]
*  And I notice that sometimes it helps me some. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4204.0s)]
*  You know, it helps me. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4208.0s)]
*  You know, my father was real old, so if I do something nice for an old man, an older man, it it's or if I do something nice for a friend's father, it's it's in a way it's me doing something nice for my own father. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4211.0s)]
*  You know, I'm just it's like a. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4223.0s)]
*  I want to say example, but there's a better term for it. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4226.0s)]
*  So you can have your relationship vicariously. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4230.0s)]
*  You can have that those needs fulfilled somewhat a little bit vicariously through other people's relationships and father son relationships. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4234.0s)]
*  I find anyway. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4243.0s)]
*  You know, I have moments where I'll tell some of my friends, fathers who've had importance in my life. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4245.0s)]
*  I'll say to them, hey, I want to thank you. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4250.0s)]
*  You know, like, you know, some of what I needed, I was missing, but you showed up there. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4252.0s)]
*  And and that's not a knock to my father because my father, I'm just I'm really saying it's kind of like I'm using someone else as a. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4259.0s)]
*  As like a template or as a mannequin for my own father. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4270.0s)]
*  So. But yeah, isn't it so deep how it's so it's like all a man, all the young man wants is for his father to be proud of him. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4277.0s)]
*  You know, it's unbelievable. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4289.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable what a want that is. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4293.0s)]
*  Maybe if we taught more in schools from that perspective, instead of from a knowledge perspective, what if we taught more from like an emotional need perspective? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4296.0s)]
*  Like, what if that, you know, how many of your like what if a class for young men was how many of you want your father to be proud of you? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4309.0s)]
*  You know, I think that's the biggest thing. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4317.0s)]
*  Like, what if a class for young men was how many of you want your father to be proud of you? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4320.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4324.0s)]
*  And then you taught from there. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4329.0s)]
*  These are ways in the world where you can create. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4332.0s)]
*  Where you can fulfill that need. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4338.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4341.0s)]
*  Thank you for calling, brother. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4343.0s)]
*  And I love you, man, and I appreciate you. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx9sTBkRyQ&t=4345.0s)]
