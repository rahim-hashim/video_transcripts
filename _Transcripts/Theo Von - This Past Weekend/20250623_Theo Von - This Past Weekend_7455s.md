*  But there was a shooting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=24.88s)]
*  Amongst some of his co-workers colleagues [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=28.26s)]
*  Minnesota lawmakers and so [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=32.02s)]
*  They're obviously very bereaved up there and and we wish them peace and prayers and hope to catch up with him another time [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=35.02s)]
*  Just advising that this episode was recorded late last week [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=43.66s)]
*  I was on tour and so we couldn't get it all put together, but we're happy to get it out today [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=47.42s)]

*  Before he got into politics. He's a member of the Republican Party, but he's a bit of a rogue guy [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=64.06s)]
*  He does things his own way and I am fortunate today to spend time with congressman Thomas [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=70.53999999999999s)]

*  Good to be here just had to cross the state border to get here [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I see from Kentucky and you are you drove like you just took me into your [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  Home in your camper home [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=107.66000000000001s)]
*  Vehicle it's a f-250 with the truck camper and I lived for two solid years in it DC still occasionally do [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=110.38s)]
*  And where would you park that thing at? Well, I don't want to disclose where I park but I did get in trouble [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=118.38s)]
*  I parked the truck camper. It's a super duty. It's got a even though it fits in the back of a pickup [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=124.22s)]
*  It's got a shower bathroom stove and a fridge felt super when I was in there that living arrangement in there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=130.42s)]
*  I could have definitely cozied up. It felt very cool. The milk felt cold in there [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=135.56s)]
*  We had a little cup of milk, which is definitely it's all milk. Yeah [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=139.88s)]
*  Hopefully don't tell anybody across state lines with that. But so here's a funny story [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=144.4s)]
*  I was parking this truck camper in DC in a congressional lot [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=149.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and it got hotter than the hinges of hell in the summertime in this parking lot [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=153.0s)]
*  So I ran a little extension cord over to the electric car charging station so I could run the air conditioner on my camper at night [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=158.2s)]
*  Well, the cops like to park they didn't know I was living in this camper and I would park close to a Sprinter van [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  And the cops would park between me and the Sprinter van to take a nap at night. Oh, so everybody's working together [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=171.76s)]
*  Yeah, I would look out the camper and do a wellness check on him at night [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  They didn't know I was looking out for but anyways one night diplomacy. It's how it all works [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=181.32s)]
*  It's like everybody's kind of hiding a little bit behind the other group one night [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  It was like that movie bridge over the river quiet [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=189.26s)]
*  They found my 50-foot extension cord and followed it over to the electric car charging station [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  They said damn there's somebody living in this truck [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=196.8s)]
*  yeah, so my chief of staff got a call from the speaker's chief of staff and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=199.68s)]
*  He said we think your boss is living in lot 28 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=204.44s)]
*  He said what do you mean in a pickup truck? Yeah, and I said I told my chief don't call him back [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=208.0s)]
*  Let me settle this so we have a don't ask don't tell [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=213.68s)]
*  As long as I don't start a koa or something in the congressional lot [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=217.16s)]
*  I can live there if the cops are getting a little bit of shut-eye [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=221.48s)]
*  You know I'm saying you're able to operate a grill [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=224.04s)]
*  You know or a little two-stroke motor in there something to keep the blender working [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=226.76s)]
*  Well, you know, I got to mix my medical margaritas in there and keep the raw milk cold [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=230.28s)]
*  so what I eventually did was cover it in solar panels and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  Took off the old air conditioner and put a mini split on the back. So it looks like the Millennium Falcon now [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=238.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it definitely looks like the guy that's in there. It definitely seemed like you want to get his fingerprints [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=244.2s)]
*  That has a codus vibe outside of it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=250.88s)]
*  You know, but you that's that isn't a lot of your vibes that you're off the grid [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=252.88s)]
*  I've heard that yeah off the grid in the camper and off the grid at home [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=256.96s)]
*  So I haven't bought public utilities in 20 years [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=261.8s)]
*  Wow, and that you know that kind of ties into when I go to DC that gives me some independence [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=265.2s)]
*  Because if all if everything goes to hell and I'm no longer a congressman and I don't have a job [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=271.12s)]
*  I still got a house where all my own utilities are taken care of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  It runs off solar got a backup generator got a well that I dug and it just gives you the sense that okay [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=281.44s)]
*  Things the the worst day in Kentucky is better than my best day in DC. Hmm, and this is you right here [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=289.68s)]
*  This is some of this is you right here. Yeah. Yeah, that's one of my gardens and there's some of my chickens [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=295.68s)]
*  clucking around [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=300.68s)]
*  Yeah, I built a mobile pen that moves with the chickens [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=302.4s)]
*  To keep the coyotes from eating them now. It's like a Roomba think of a Roomba with 50 chickens in it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay moving around in my yard [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=312.84s)]
*  It runs on solar collects rainwater and it takes care of my chickens when I'm not there and what makes it move [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=314.52s)]
*  How does that even work bring that up Trevin? Can you get me so you see what I'm looking at? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't have any footage of it on here [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=323.32s)]
*  But I call it so I it first ran off batteries and a solar panel and the batteries went dead and I'm like this sucks [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=325.52s)]
*  I don't like taking batteries to a landfill because I was trying to come up with a green way to raise chickens [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=332.14s)]
*  So I figured out a way to do it with super capacitors [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no battery in it and the super capacitors never wear out and I call it the Clucks capacitor [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Is this kind of an example? Yeah, that's what it's like except. Yeah, except mine moves itself. Mine's like a Roomba version [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  That's robotic and so what is the point of it moving? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=351.74s)]
*  Well, you know chickens poop and you don't want them walking around in their own poop [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=354.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=359.7s)]
*  They also like to eat a certain amount of grass and bugs and so this gives them fresh forage and it keeps them out of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=360.34s)]
*  Their poop they don't get disease it fertilizes my yard. It mows my grass [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=366.3s)]
*  Everything's all happy in the Clucks capacitor. I got a good a damn chicken dude or a little batch of chickens [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=370.94s)]
*  I got to get something I almost bought my mom two goats, but she like for years [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  She's like give me some goats and then [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=381.22s)]
*  Then she didn't want it. She just has a problem with everything. But um anyway, uh [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=383.38000000000005s)]
*  So what is a flux capacitor Clucks capacitor? Okay. What is an actual what is it? It's the circuit that I designed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=387.66s)]
*  so I'm a double E by training electrical engineer by training and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  I just had to come up with some way to keep my chickens alive and keep them healthy while I went to DC [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  So I came up with this [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=403.70000000000005s)]
*  Circuit board that's got capacitors that trickle charge from a little solar panel size of a sheet of paper [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=405.26000000000005s)]
*  And it's got an automotive winch in the front so it can pull itself even if it weighs 2,500 pounds [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=411.22s)]
*  Along a cable so you don't have you don't pay an electric bill. No electric bill. No water bill. No sewer bill [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=418.38000000000005s)]
*  I do have an internet bill because I use Starlink. Oh, yeah, and is that legal? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=424.14000000000004s)]
*  Are you allowed to legally be a person like that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=428.94000000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, they tried to bring more regulation to our county [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  20 years ago before I was a congressman and I wrote letters to the editor and mobilize people and we stopped them from [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=435.42s)]
*  Bringing more regulation to our county. So it's still legal where I live [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=440.86s)]
*  Wow, cuz this is it seems like a very like libertarian or almost like demo [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=445.02000000000004s)]
*  Like a lot of the ideas seem almost very like something you would see like on the Democratic Party, which sounds kind of wild [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, oh I say I'm the greenest member of Congress and no Democrat has come after me [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=453.82s)]
*  No fact checker has ever tried to check that fact because they know it's true [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  Wow, it's kind of crazy that the greenest member, you know with the term greens is now a Republican because you wouldn't necessarily think that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=462.94s)]
*  No, you wouldn't think that I mean I have a Tesla that charges off the solar panels on my house [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=469.54s)]
*  Collect rainwater I dug a well. I've got a bunch of trees that I'm not cutting down [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=476.22s)]
*  They are bringing in all kinds of co2. Although I like co2 [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=481.26000000000005s)]
*  I wish I had more because it makes my peaches get bigger on my farm [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=485.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah, my I raise grass-fed cattle and what kind of what kind of group do you have helping you over there? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=488.82000000000005s)]
*  Cuz I don't think you can't get out there first thing every day and do it all I do it myself [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=494.62s)]
*  90% of it. I mean if I'm in DC and the cattle get loose [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=498.98s)]
*  I've got a neighbor, you know, you got to have some neighbors that will help you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=503.38s)]
*  And the deal is I'll help them when they need help. Oh, there's a picture of my cattle [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=506.8s)]
*  They are Angus crossed with wagyu. I call them Wangus. Oh, wow Wangus beef. It's a little oh, yeah [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=511.46s)]
*  It's a little urban over there. Definitely. That's definitely [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=517.58s)]
*  There's there's the you know, not the black sheep, but the white cow [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=520.66s)]
*  He kind of stands out I say I feel like that white cow in DC some days [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=524.18s)]
*  Yeah, like do I really belong in this herd? Yeah [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=529.38s)]
*  Yeah, you seem like a little bit of like an outsider [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=532.86s)]
*  I think like or you know, like a black sheep or like a maverick [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  I feel like people say if they talk about a maverick and they say Thomas Massey, you know [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=537.54s)]
*  How much money do you save by living the way that you do like off-grid? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=542.02s)]
*  You know, I don't think I've saved the dime. It costs a lot to do it [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=546.62s)]
*  You can save money by heating your house with wood [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=550.86s)]
*  Which I do but you get if you start counting the how much you're paying yourself when you chop that wood [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=553.5s)]
*  It's probably about three dollars an hour, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=560.02s)]
*  And I could go work a dollar general and make more money than I do when I save money heat my house with wood [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=562.18s)]
*  So if I were completely, you know poor I could keep living but to set all that up took [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=567.7s)]
*  Took a large investment. It will probably pay off by the time I die [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=574.18s)]
*  So you just want to end the book with your book zero. Yeah. Yeah, just clear the tab when I leave the bar [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=577.84s)]
*  No debt. No debt. Yeah, yeah, cuz you always wonder like okay. I want to live off the grid [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=583.4s)]
*  I want but there's a there's a real cost to it. A lot of that cost is sweat equity [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like yeah, it's sweat equity and it'll it'll pay back unlike what we're doing in DC [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=592.2s)]
*  I mean if we were borrowing money in DC to fund the future I could be for borrowing money [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=597.6s)]
*  The problem is up there it's not like on my farm where you invest in fences and you invest in livestock in DC [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=604.2800000000001s)]
*  we're just pissing away the money and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  Living on basically our seed corn. We are taking what should be saved for the next generation and spending it now [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=614.44s)]
*  Is that how you feel? Yeah, it's we're robbing the next generation, but it's got so bad [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=621.5s)]
*  We're robbing ourselves five years from now, right? It's getting that close. Yeah, I've heard you talk about are you talking about the national debt overall? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay, I've heard you talk a lot about it and I see you got your this is my my debt bench [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=632.24s)]
*  It shows I've got three levels of brightness [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=637.72s)]
*  So if you wear it to the movies you can tone it down and not blind your date [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=639.96s)]
*  But okay, so I got on the brightest level there. Hopefully your camera can see it. Yeah, I wear this every second [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=644.32s)]
*  I'm in that House of Representatives. I wear it in hearings. I wear it in elevators with Democrats [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=650.6400000000001s)]
*  They think it's how many steps I've taken but I built this using my electrical engineering degree [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  I came up with this idea and I built it [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=661.88s)]
*  It's got Wi-Fi once a day it connects to the treasury gov and calibrates to the penny [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=664.04s)]
*  So it's the most accurate debt [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  Representation that you can have in fact, you know, it's I mean make sure like Mark Zucker twain [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=673.52s)]
*  This this is I brought you one as a gift. Yeah, brother. So [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=679.72s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude, you can just stare at the numbers just spin it all day long. It's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=685.32s)]
*  It's an yeah just clips onto your pocket there. What kind of woman am I gonna meet wearing this though? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=690.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what kind you've been meeting but you've really upped your game with that thing you think yeah [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=694.8399999999999s)]
*  They're gonna think I am way broke. I had I had a female congressman staring at my chest [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=699.88s)]
*  The other day and I had to tell her my eyes were up here [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  And then she asked if I would make a belt buckle out of it [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people want it all nowadays people just want to see your damn wiener if they can for free sometimes [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=714.68s)]
*  I'm like get away from me [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=719.76s)]
*  But let's talk about the national debt actually [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  Because can you explain it to me a lot of people don't even understand the national debt we hear about it [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=724.8s)]
*  What is the amount right now to well, we don't even really know [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=729.68s)]
*  I mean, this is the regime number the one that Treasury publishes is thirty six point two trillion roughly [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=732.68s)]
*  Trillion dollars. Okay. Yeah now you see this one online. Huh? It's not that accurate [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=739.36s)]
*  Like it's off by a few hundred billion [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=743.48s)]
*  We we were shipping these debt clocks [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=746.96s)]
*  I don't make them but my son-in-law makes them and sells them and he had somebody go online and find this debt counter and say [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=749.24s)]
*  Oh, you sold me a faulty debt badge and he's like no is ours calibrates with Treasury every day [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=755.36s)]
*  It's so sad that we can't even get a D even our debt clock doesn't even at least invest in the fucking [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  Clock that shows the debt right? Well what they might be trying to do there online is [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  Anticipate when we lift the debt limit like right now we've hit the debt limit [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=772.68s)]
*  So it's stuck at thirty six point two trillion dollars every day [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=777.7199999999999s)]
*  They sort of reset the number until Congress raises the debt limit now you say how do they do that? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=781.4s)]
*  Well, they start selling off the postal workers pension fund [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=787.68s)]
*  They take the money that's been saved up to pay your postman his retirement [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=791.0799999999999s)]
*  And they use that to fund other parts of the government [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=795.56s)]
*  They can only do that for a few months and that's what we've been doing for you know [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=799.04s)]
*  The first six months of this presidency and pretty soon we're gonna run out of all those extra things we can spend that we're leveraging [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=802.76s)]
*  Basically, yeah, we're leveraging all that and they're gonna have to pay it all back. So we're really probably are closer to thirty six point [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=809.84s)]
*  six or thirty six point eight trillion and but is that a common practice like leveraging like pensions or [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=817.52s)]
*  I don't say like Medicaid and Medicare. They're not leveraging that right? Oh anything they can get their hands on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=823.84s)]
*  They liquidate it and they spend it for instance to buy bombs and send them overseas [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=828.32s)]
*  That all that deficit spending right now is not funded by Treasury bonds that all the new [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  Deficit spending is funded by you know, the the trust funds that have been established that might have money in them [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=839.84s)]
*  Okay, I'm a little confused on that. Um, well, it's like it's it's like this Theo [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=847.96s)]
*  Let's say you saved up for your kids [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=854.2800000000001s)]
*  College, okay, they've been going to college and you got enough to pay the next semester of college [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=858.04s)]
*  but your credit card comes in and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  Your credit card gets canceled. So instead of renewing your credit card [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=866.48s)]
*  You just spend your kids, you know next tranche of tuition or something [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  But you've got to find that money before the next semester comes back or else they get kicked out of school [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=874.5s)]
*  Okay, and so how do we find that money like because obviously we repeatedly [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=879.24s)]
*  Well, Congress is going to pass a law here in the next few weeks and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're just gonna say oh, well, there's no debt limit. It's now five trillion dollars higher than what we said [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=887.84s)]
*  They move the limit up. They move the limit up. They get a new credit card [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=893.18s)]
*  They go out they start borrowing new money to pay off the money [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=896.34s)]
*  They borrowed and it's a vicious cycle got it and it's obviously it's a cycle that we've been in for a long time [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=899.84s)]
*  I think to the point where like the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=904.42s)]
*  National debt doesn't even make sense to people right? It's like [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=906.88s)]
*  Here's my question is who do we owe the money to? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=910.3s)]
*  Some of it is owed to institutional investors like the big banks in the United States [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=913.26s)]
*  Some of it is owed to sovereign wealth funds like China Japan other [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=918.5799999999999s)]
*  countries that buy our debt for us [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=923.9s)]
*  it's and [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=927.5s)]
*  Here's here's the problem right now. They're telling us [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=929.66s)]
*  We don't want to buy your debt at 2% or 3% or 4% [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=933.78s)]
*  We want at least 5% return and so everybody thinks the Federal Reserve is setting interest rates [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=938.1s)]
*  You know, there's all this discussion with the Fed raised the rate [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=943.8199999999999s)]
*  Well the Fed lower the rate the reality right now is the Fed can't do much [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=946.24s)]
*  Because if they lower the rate to let's say 4% [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=950.54s)]
*  The that and try to tell people to buy our debt at 4% the people who normally buy our debt those foreign countries and those [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=953.8199999999999s)]
*  institutional investors are saying you're not a good investment at 4% we want 5% and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=961.0s)]
*  That's that's a big problem because just to put it in perspective [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=966.78s)]
*  You know, let's let's round this number if it were 30 trillion dollars and we were paying 5% that's that's [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=971.86s)]
*  That is [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=979.38s)]
*  $16,000 per family. I've already done the math. I'm not doing all that in my head right now, but it's [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=981.74s)]
*  $16,000 per family of interest that we are paying got it [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=988.26s)]
*  So when you pay your taxes for your family the first [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=992.06s)]
*  $16,000 goes to nothing except for the interest that's paid to those foreign countries and to the big bankers [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=995.8599999999999s)]
*  But we're never gonna defeat this number [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1001.92s)]
*  You know, we might get in a situation like Puerto Rico got into a few years ago where the people said we're just not loaning [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1005.5799999999999s)]
*  You anymore and you know what happens that day? It's actually kind of a it'll be scary for a lot of people for me [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1011.02s)]
*  It would be a good day because that's the day we have to balance the budget [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1017.02s)]
*  When people say we're not gonna loan you any more money, you're not a good investment [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1021.0200000000001s)]
*  We don't trust that you'll pay it back [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1024.5800000000002s)]
*  That is the day that you can only spend as much money as you take in on any given week [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1026.22s)]
*  And are a lot of people in Congress aware of this and like battling it or it just seems like it's almost seems like we [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1032.3400000000001s)]
*  Don't even hear about like it seems like it's one of those things you hear about during the election cycle and that's about it [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1038.22s)]
*  You know [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1042.3s)]
*  Like we're gonna balance the budget and it never happened. No one ever balances the budget like [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1044.02s)]
*  Do you think anyone even either one of these parties even want to balance the budget? No, they're not serious about it [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1049.14s)]
*  It's why I built the debt badge to like shove it in their face every day and it's still they're still not concerned about it [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1055.18s)]
*  I mean, they're a little bit concerned, but as long as they can get reelected [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1061.5600000000002s)]
*  They're not that concerned right and I don't blame them for all of it [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1065.94s)]
*  I blame the American people who keep [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1069.9s)]
*  Re-electing people who because they tell them you can have these things and it won't cost anything [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1073.2s)]
*  So I I hear people talk about like mass deportations and there's a hundred billion to DHS and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1079.32s)]
*  50 billion to DOJ to do mass deportations. Well, we know we [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1087.36s)]
*  It's not it doesn't cost that whatever Trump has intended to do [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1092.72s)]
*  it's not going to cost 150 billion dollars, but people say I don't care what it costs and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1096.28s)]
*  The reason they say I don't care what it costs is they don't think they're paying it. Yeah, they don't care what anything costs [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't care what war in the Middle East costs because they don't see that they're paying it [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1107.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's all gotten so confusing and when you when you start with communication with people even on a financial front of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  This Hogwarts Ian number [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1118.3200000000002s)]
*  You start because we all learn basic math in school. Some of us learn algebra some of us going to learn some higher maths, right? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  But when you when you starting with this we the regular person doesn't know where to begin you feel literally like [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1128.0s)]
*  Numerically defeated out of the gate, right the average person because it's like how [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1135.04s)]
*  Possible so it this sets everything up with impossibility, right? So I think that's why we've gotten so far [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1141.68s)]
*  we've gotten, you know two generations now into complete impossibility of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1148.94s)]
*  Of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1153.52s)]
*  Numerical reality when it comes to even having some of the discussions, I think does it make any sense? No, that makes sense [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1154.72s)]
*  It's virtual reality [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  Right you did the last five digits on this deck counter. They change about [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1161.3999999999999s)]

*  Boom boom boom. That's how much debt we're taking on most of the I hope the new model looks a little bit different [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1173.8s)]
*  I have a cyber truck but and the do you yeah and the my camper in it [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1179.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I don't know if we can fit it in there. I don't think so. That's why I have it f-250, dude [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1184.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think I need to get something that fucking I want something that it feels like it'll you'll burn a death when you hit some [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1188.8400000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's what I like about something. It's got some real fuel in it, but this thing [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1194.8s)]
*  Yeah, this thing death. Oh, there's one with a camper, but I think the New Orleans will have can't like better camper abilities [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1199.02s)]
*  There's no way to get out of the inside like through the back window right now [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1204.92s)]
*  And it kind of feels like you just work for Lowe's but you never drop off what you're delivering [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1209.4s)]
*  You always like where does this go? You know, like how much meats in here? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  It just says that very like a whirlpool or frigid air kind of energy [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1217.28s)]
*  But it does go very fast. You almost feel like you could beat an email somewhere like that bitch is fast, dude [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1221.96s)]
*  The big let's let's talk since we're talking about debt. Let's talk a little bit about the the big beautiful bill, right? Yeah and [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1228.48s)]
*  It you you oppose it yeah, right and there's reasons that I've learned recently that I oppose [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1235.04s)]
*  I don't know a ton of them, but there's I know some of my reasons, but I don't know what everything it's in the bill [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1241.06s)]
*  why are you against it because [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  It's well, it's it's not gonna help our debt. No [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1249.0s)]
*  That that's the first big lie that's told about the big beautiful bill. You can finagle the numbers [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1252.92s)]
*  The big beautiful bill looks at a 10-year spending window, okay, and what it does is in the next five years [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1259.24s)]
*  It's going to add to the deficit like nobody disputes that even the number crunchers that work for the president [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1265.72s)]
*  No, that's going to happen. What they're claiming is five years from now [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1271.6s)]
*  It will start to break even and reduce the deficit [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1275.6799999999998s)]
*  The problem is the people I serve with a lot of them aren't going to be there five years from now, right? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1280.72s)]
*  The president Trump's not gonna be there five years from now [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1286.28s)]
*  This big beautiful bill doesn't force people five years from now to do that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1289.36s)]
*  It suggests that they should do that and it will do that unless somebody does something different [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1294.18s)]
*  But they're gonna do something different five years from now. We'll get to that point and they'll say oh my gosh that [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1299.16s)]
*  Congress five years ago set up a fiscal cliff [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1305.44s)]
*  We're gonna be hit with tax increases on seniors. We're gonna be hit with tax on tips [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1308.92s)]
*  We're gonna be hit with tax on overtime. We're oh my gosh [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1315.04s)]
*  The military is not gonna get as much money as it got last year [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1318.7s)]
*  We got to do something about this and so what they'll do is they'll cut taxes again and they'll increase spending again [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1322.42s)]
*  And this deficit will never go down and I'm not even talking about the debt. The deficit is how much you add to the debt every year [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1329.52s)]
*  It's about two trillion dollars [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1336.6399999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be above two trillion dollars next year and for as far as the eye can see [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1338.2s)]
*  But I got to talk with [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1343.1s)]
*  JD Vance a couple of weeks ago and he was talking about [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1345.34s)]
*  But that a lot of what's happening now is still because of the last party that was in [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of it's still because of what Trump did when he was in last time [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1354.1799999999998s)]
*  So I just wondered how far it's it's tough to occur like as a regular person [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1359.22s)]
*  It's tough to correlate how far up or downstream you are from whatever who was actually responsible for whatever is occurring [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1363.1s)]
*  Does that make sense? It does make sense [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1370.0s)]
*  But you know in 2020 we had kovat hit and they put a two trillion dollar spending bill on the floor and [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1371.7199999999998s)]
*  They I was the only one who would oppose it [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1378.0s)]
*  I said this is gonna cause this was Trump was president and Pelosi was speaker, but they were working together [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1380.74s)]
*  I said this is gonna cause massive inflation [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  You're gonna have shortages in the stores and this is gonna last for years and the inflation once it happens [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1388.82s)]
*  The prices will never go back down and that's exactly what happened [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1395.32s)]
*  They said Congress and Massie the president's chief of staff at the time told me he said it was Mark Meadows [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1399.1000000000001s)]
*  Who's a friend of mine? We both work together in Congress [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1404.8200000000002s)]
*  He said the reason this is two trillion dollars is so we don't have to pass another one of these [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1406.94s)]
*  It's just gonna be painful once well guess what by the time December rolled around under Trump [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1411.7800000000002s)]
*  We passed another one of these stimulus packages that was over a trillion dollars [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1416.48s)]
*  And don't forget people got a twelve hundred dollar check the first time and they got a six hundred dollar check the second time [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1420.1000000000001s)]
*  I told folks that's the cheese in the trap that most of you know that twelve hundred dollar check you multiply that times the number [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1426.58s)]
*  Of families in the United States it wasn't five percent of the spending in that bill most of that money went to corporations and banks [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1433.64s)]
*  eventually yeah, and so [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1440.7s)]
*  Everybody's responsible for it. Everybody wants to point to to the other party for it [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1443.3s)]
*  But you know, it's I don't want to upset too many people who like wrestling but it's like the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1448.78s)]
*  WWF okay, or oh it's felt like this for years. I think everything is turning into the WWE everything. Yeah all [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1456.0400000000002s)]
*  it's all like [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1463.72s)]
*  Optics and the way things are shot and this is out there and this is what you believe [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1466.24s)]
*  It's like interviews that are just to get the hype and then they offstage [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1470.0s)]
*  They're all in the you know in the locker room list like, you know [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1474.16s)]
*  Rubbing GHB on each other's backs and stuff like that and gramming out [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1477.24s)]
*  Let me tell you something that probably will shock your listeners whether they're Republican or Democrat Mike Johnson since he's been the speaker [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1481.08s)]
*  And he's only been the speaker for less than two years has put a hundred and eighty three Democrat bills on the floor and passed them [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1488.6s)]
*  What do you trade for that? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1496.28s)]
*  Like I thought we're breaking chairs over top of the Democrats heads in the back room. No, that's not what's happening [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1498.04s)]
*  Is that true? Yeah, how do I look that up go to? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1504.76s)]
*  Congress gov and John's out of Shreveport. Yep. He's the speaker of the house [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1508.76s)]
*  But you can see you like if you [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1514.08s)]
*  I'm not sure how you look it up here at congress.gov [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1517.24s)]
*  But you if you spend enough time here and look at every bill that's passed since he's been speaker [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1520.72s)]
*  Uh-huh, and and I'm not talking about the special bills that reassign committee members. I'm talking about bills that do something [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1526.24s)]
*  183 [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1533.24s)]
*  Democrat sponsored bills and you might say Theo well the Democrats have good ideas. Okay, we should put their bills on the floor [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1534.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, if I had a good idea what speaker Johnson would do would take that bill from me put somebody else's name on it and put it on the floor [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1541.72s)]
*  Like if there's something that needs to get done [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1550.16s)]
*  Why would you let a Democrat get credit for it if you're in this mortal combat with the other party? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1552.44s)]
*  But has he made a lot of Republican bills passed too? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1558.28s)]
*  Yeah, but there have been yeah, there's been way more Republican bills than Democrat bills [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1560.28s)]
*  But why is he even passed one Democrat bill? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1565.0s)]
*  Well, I think don't you want to work with the other team and it's like isn't it isn't their diplomacy and everything like you know [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1567.0s)]
*  What I'm saying like you have to like there's a give-and-take to everything. I feel like we've got the majority [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1571.76s)]
*  Like why are we putting their bills on the floor? Why would we go in that direction? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1576.4s)]
*  I understand in the Senate you need 60 votes. So you got to have a Democrat, but some of the bills are good, right? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1580.72s)]
*  If Thomas Massey has a good bill, they'll put another Republicans name on it and pass it [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1587.4399999999998s)]
*  But but but I can't understand what you're saying here. I guess I'm a little bit confused. Are you saying that? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1592.32s)]
*  Mr. Johnson who is the he's a speaker the house that he because bills get brought to him. He puts them on the floor [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1597.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. He's the one who's like, okay [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1604.84s)]
*  Let's put this on the floor and take it to a vote [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1606.6799999999998s)]
*  Mm-hmm, right and you're saying that he he's done that with more Democratic led bills than Republican like no [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1608.52s)]
*  He's done with a hundred and eighty three Democratic bills [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1614.1s)]
*  He's probably there's probably been hunt of several hundred Republican bills [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1616.62s)]
*  My question though is why would you put one on if you're engaged in this kind of mortal combat for the soul of the country? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1620.1s)]
*  And he's any acts like that. It's because people aren't paying attention to what's going on there [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1626.06s)]
*  Oh, I agree that I think people aren't paying attention. I think it's there's so it's all so confusing [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1631.82s)]
*  I think to the regular person is that it's that it feels like [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1637.3799999999999s)]
*  It feels like it the ship sailed long ago from us being at the dock looking each other in the eyes [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1641.0800000000002s)]
*  with some sense of hope Congress is this big giant black box and [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1646.92s)]
*  People can't see what's going on inside of that black box [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1652.0s)]
*  they know they're electing their congressman and to their senators and [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1655.2s)]
*  The president and they're sending them to Washington DC and then they don't understand what comes out of that box [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1659.56s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I've been in that box for 12 years [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1665.32s)]
*  Okay, and that's I think that's sort of what my role has evolved to which is to just try to tell people what's going on [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1668.12s)]
*  Inside of the box so that they can do a better job of picking [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1675.32s)]
*  Congressman and senators. That's what I always think I'm like if somebody would just get elected is to get in there and tell us [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1679.36s)]
*  What's we don't even fucking? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=1684.52s)]

*  And bring up omnibus bill [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2020.06s)]
*  We looked it up the other day when Mr. Vance was here [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2021.06s)]
*  But I just want to go over it again [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2024.06s)]
*  An omnibus bill is proposed law that covers a number of diverse or unrelated topics [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2025.1799999999998s)]
*  Omnibus is derived from Latin, it means to, for, by, with, or from everything [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2030.1799999999998s)]
*  An omnibus bill is a single document that is accepted in a single vote by a legislator [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2035.1799999999998s)]
*  But packages together several measures into one or combines diverse subjects [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2040.1799999999998s)]
*  So it's not even really fair because you only get one vote on the bill [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2044.1799999999998s)]
*  Correct [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2047.1799999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2048.18s)]
*  And so typically an omnibus bill, it includes at least 12 other bills [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2049.2999999999997s)]
*  Because the 1974 Budget Control Act, there's a law that says we're supposed to do these bills separately [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2055.2999999999997s)]
*  So we've already tried the law, we already tried that Theo [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2061.2999999999997s)]
*  They just suspend that rule, those budget rules, every year [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2064.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so take me through this moment so I don't stray from it so people can be [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2068.2999999999997s)]
*  So I can understand it [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2073.2999999999997s)]
*  So like give me two examples of things that would be on an omnibus bill [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2074.42s)]
*  That would be that there's no way for a voter to win [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2079.42s)]
*  That there's no way for a representative to vote and win on [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2082.42s)]
*  Okay, well the easiest, let me just take something topical, the big beautiful bill [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2086.42s)]
*  Inside of that big beautiful bill is a provision for artificial intelligence corporations [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2093.42s)]
*  That says no [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2098.42s)]
*  10 years [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2099.42s)]
*  For 10 years, no state or locality can regulate them [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2100.54s)]
*  And it talks about zoning and routing [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2105.54s)]
*  Which if you, you know, some of your listeners may have seen this [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2108.54s)]
*  Like locally, somebody, some big corporation wants to put a data center in your backyard [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2111.54s)]
*  Well that's what Congress is trying to do [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2116.54s)]
*  They're trying to say that these corporations can override local zoning laws [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2118.54s)]
*  That the local zoning board should take a backseat and let this big information center [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2123.54s)]
*  Show up in your backyard that uses all kinds of water and all kinds of power [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2127.66s)]
*  And puts out all kinds of RF [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2131.66s)]
*  And has, you know [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2133.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, your fucking cousin's gonna be walking down the street [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2134.66s)]
*  Just fucking, you know, just fucking screaming out Amazon orders, you know [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2137.66s)]
*  It's gonna be, the shit that's gonna start happening is gonna be crazy [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2141.66s)]
*  You're literally gonna be driving down the road with your windows open [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2144.66s)]
*  And an old gust of 5G remnants from blockbuster emails that never got out of, got out of, got uploaded [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2147.66s)]
*  And you're just gonna pass through your fucking vehicle [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2155.7799999999997s)]
*  Shit's gonna get insane [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2157.7799999999997s)]
*  You're gonna have babies that are born with advertisements [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2159.7799999999997s)]
*  Like birthmarks that show up [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2162.7799999999997s)]
*  This is a set of twins with Nike logos on them [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2164.7799999999997s)]
*  What is happening, man? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2167.7799999999997s)]
*  So that's in the big beautiful bill, okay? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2169.7799999999997s)]
*  And you can know that's evil, you can know that's bad [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2171.7799999999997s)]
*  And Trump never campaigned on that [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2174.7799999999997s)]
*  But also in that bill is to enforce our borders, okay? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2176.7799999999997s)]
*  To finish the wall [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2181.7799999999997s)]
*  Right [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2182.7799999999997s)]
*  You're a Republican [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2183.9s)]
*  And you vote for that bill [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2184.9s)]
*  Okay, you support it enforcing the border [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2186.9s)]
*  But you also let AI basically take over your local and state governments, okay? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2188.9s)]
*  And then if you vote against it [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2194.9s)]
*  Well then you're against the AI provision [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2197.9s)]
*  But oh my gosh, you're for open borders, you know? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2199.9s)]
*  You're for, you don't want to support the military [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2202.9s)]
*  There was $100 billion in there for the military [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2204.9s)]
*  There was, oh, you want to tax seniors [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2207.9s)]
*  There was a tax cut for seniors [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2210.9s)]
*  There was an extension of the tax cuts from 2017 [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2213.02s)]
*  I voted for the 2017 tax cuts [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2216.02s)]
*  But I voted against this 2025 bill [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2219.02s)]
*  Because it's got a lot of crap in there that doesn't belong [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2221.02s)]
*  And it's going to balloon our deficit [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2224.02s)]
*  So you can't win for losing [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2226.02s)]
*  And so I don't blame a lot of my colleagues [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2229.02s)]
*  They come to Congress [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2233.02s)]
*  They have the best intentions [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2236.02s)]
*  And you get there and you're like, oh my gosh, this whole game is rigged [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2238.02s)]
*  How am I going to play it? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2241.02s)]
*  Am I going to call it out? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2242.14s)]
*  Will that be the best for my constituents who elected me? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2244.14s)]
*  Or should I play along? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2248.14s)]
*  And most of them choose to play along [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2250.14s)]
*  And you can't really blame them [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2253.14s)]
*  They feel like, oh, my fiduciary duty to the people who elected me [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2255.14s)]
*  Is to get as much as I can up here [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2260.14s)]
*  And if I piss off the Trump and I piss off Mike Johnson [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2262.14s)]
*  I can't get any table scraps [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2266.14s)]
*  But the reality is, they're not even getting table scraps [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2268.14s)]
*  They are trading [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2271.2599999999998s)]
*  I say every week, congressmen trade their votes for magic beans [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2272.2599999999998s)]
*  That never sprout [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2276.2599999999998s)]
*  Like Jack and the Beanstalk [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2277.2599999999998s)]
*  He trades the cow for magic beans [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2278.2599999999998s)]
*  The difference is Jack got beans that sprouted [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2280.2599999999998s)]
*  My congressmen, they're not getting gas vouchers [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2283.2599999999998s)]
*  They're not getting a cracker barrel gift certificate [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2285.2599999999998s)]
*  So explain to me how that part works [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2288.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's a part that I don't understand [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2291.2599999999998s)]
*  Because you mentioned a little while ago [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2292.2599999999998s)]
*  You're like, I could have a bill and I put it forward [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2293.2599999999998s)]
*  Because Mike Johnson seems like a good guy [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2296.2599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't seem like somebody that would take something that was yours [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2298.2599999999998s)]
*  And make it somebody else's [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2300.38s)]
*  Like I don't understand what you're saying [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2301.38s)]
*  So I don't understand what you're saying [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2304.38s)]
*  Like how does that work? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2305.38s)]
*  And take me through [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2306.38s)]
*  Like how can you put a bill out [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2307.38s)]
*  And people would know what your bill is [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2309.38s)]
*  I mean, obviously, is there information online [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2311.38s)]
*  That says this is a bill that Thomas Massie made? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2313.38s)]
*  Or that any person made? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2315.38s)]
*  Like any representative made? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2317.38s)]
*  The other thing they'll do with your bills [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2319.38s)]
*  Is they'll stick them in another bill [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2321.38s)]
*  I'll give you an example [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2323.38s)]
*  Show me how you're saying that people aren't even getting the scraps [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2325.38s)]
*  Or whatever [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2327.38s)]
*  Take me through some of that [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2328.38s)]
*  Well, they're not [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2329.5s)]
*  Theo, I tell people [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2331.5s)]
*  I joke with my colleagues up there [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2332.5s)]
*  They're like Massie, you're not a sellout [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2334.5s)]
*  I look at them in the eye [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2337.5s)]
*  I'm the biggest sellout up here [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2339.5s)]
*  Like I would sell out for Snickers Bar [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2340.5s)]
*  But you guys aren't even getting a Snickers Bar [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2343.5s)]
*  You're not getting a bridge in your district [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2345.5s)]
*  You're not getting a new exit off the interstate [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2346.5s)]
*  You're not getting anything for your vote [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2348.5s)]
*  Like nobody's ever offered me anything up there of value [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2350.5s)]
*  I don't even know myself [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2354.5s)]
*  I could be the biggest sellout there is [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2356.5s)]
*  There's just no trade up there that's worth taking [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2358.62s)]
*  And so mostly people are trying to stay relevant and get re-elected [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2362.62s)]
*  Right, that makes perfect sense, right? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2367.62s)]
*  Everybody's looking out for themselves in a sense [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2369.62s)]
*  But you would think at some point that even that would lose its appeal [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2371.62s)]
*  When you look around your town or your community [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2374.62s)]
*  And you see that like, oh man [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2377.62s)]
*  By not really benefiting the people [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2380.62s)]
*  It's all falling apart [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2383.62s)]
*  By not really benefiting the country [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2385.62s)]
*  It's falling apart [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2387.74s)]
*  And fuck, I'm starting to sound like a downer again [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2388.74s)]
*  I don't want to do that [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2390.74s)]
*  It should [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2391.74s)]
*  But take me through [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2392.74s)]
*  Take me through what you're talking about [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2393.74s)]
*  How you put a bill up and it doesn't get labeled yours [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2394.74s)]
*  So it's plagiarism? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2396.74s)]
*  I don't understand what you're saying [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2397.74s)]
*  And then if you do get something done [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2399.74s)]
*  By working inside of the system [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2401.74s)]
*  You won't get any credit for it [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2403.74s)]
*  So for instance, when Ron Paul left Congress [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2405.74s)]
*  I came into Congress [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2409.74s)]
*  That's Randy's daddy? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2411.74s)]
*  Yep, Rand's dad [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2412.74s)]
*  I introduced a lot of Ron Paul's bills [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2413.74s)]
*  And one was the Industrial Hemp Farming Act [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2416.8599999999997s)]
*  Because it was illegal [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2419.8599999999997s)]
*  They treated hemp just like marijuana [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2420.8599999999997s)]
*  It was illegal to grow it [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2422.8599999999997s)]
*  According to the federal government [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2423.8599999999997s)]
*  So I introduced that bill [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2425.8599999999997s)]
*  And I got a lot of co-sponsors [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2427.8599999999997s)]
*  And I figured out a way to work with Democrats [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2429.8599999999997s)]
*  And get it into the farm bill [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2432.8599999999997s)]
*  Now it was a Republican farm bill that I got it into [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  But I needed Democrat and Republican votes to do it [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2438.8599999999997s)]
*  And I got it in the farm bill [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2440.8599999999997s)]
*  But now like people online say [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2442.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, Congressman Massey [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2445.98s)]
*  And it became law, by the way [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2446.98s)]
*  And people can grow industrial hemp in all 50 states [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2447.98s)]
*  That's the rest of the story [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2450.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, a lot of chicks that don't wear deodorant [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2452.98s)]
*  Are working on those places [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2454.98s)]
*  No offense, ladies [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2456.98s)]
*  I don't mind it [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2457.98s)]
*  I'm glad that we have another product in our country [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2461.98s)]
*  Right [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2463.98s)]
*  And so that became law [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2464.98s)]
*  That was one of my bills [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2467.98s)]
*  But nobody ever gives me credit for it [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2468.98s)]
*  Because it wasn't a separate bill that said [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2470.98s)]
*  And by the way [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2472.98s)]
*  I voted for that crap sandwich [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2474.1s)]
*  The farm bill [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2476.1s)]
*  Which is a big giant bill [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2478.1s)]
*  And then I took crap for voting for that [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2480.1s)]
*  Because it had my thing in it [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2482.1s)]
*  But now I don't get credit for it [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2484.1s)]
*  But I haven't particularly had bills [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2486.1s)]
*  Where somebody took my name off them [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2489.1s)]
*  And put somebody else's name [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2491.1s)]
*  But my colleagues have [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2492.1s)]
*  So you haven't had that exact thing happen [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2494.1s)]
*  To you from Mike Johnson [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2496.1s)]
*  No [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2497.1s)]
*  But you've seen it happen [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2498.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2499.1s)]
*  And if it did, I wouldn't care that much [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2500.1s)]
*  I mean if it's a good bill [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2501.1s)]
*  Make it happen [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2502.1s)]
*  But a lot of people [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2503.22s)]
*  They need to go back to their district [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2505.22s)]
*  And say I got this done [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2507.22s)]
*  Oh I see [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2508.22s)]
*  So a lot of times [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2509.22s)]
*  People don't know from their congresspeople [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2510.22s)]
*  Or their representatives [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2514.22s)]
*  That they actually got this thing done [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2515.22s)]
*  Right [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2517.22s)]
*  So there's a communication issue there [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2518.22s)]
*  And then there's another thing that happens [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2519.22s)]
*  Like some congressman gets to DC [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2521.22s)]
*  And they have this bill [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2523.22s)]
*  They wanted to pass [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2525.22s)]
*  Even before he was a congressman [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2526.22s)]
*  And they say we'll put your name on it [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2528.22s)]
*  And then you'll get credit for it [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2530.22s)]
*  And then the congressman has no idea [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2532.3399999999997s)]
*  About the subject or anything [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2535.3399999999997s)]
*  So I had [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2537.3399999999997s)]
*  There was a bill that came to the floor [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2538.3399999999997s)]
*  It was about opioids [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2540.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2541.3399999999997s)]
*  And I voted against it [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2542.3399999999997s)]
*  And the sponsor of the bill comes up to me [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2544.3399999999997s)]
*  And says why did you vote against my bill? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2546.3399999999997s)]
*  And I said well I'm not against research [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2548.3399999999997s)]
*  Or things like that at the federal level [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2551.3399999999997s)]
*  But this is basically a form of Obamacare [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2553.3399999999997s)]
*  And I thought we were against that [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2555.3399999999997s)]
*  Like because this had treatment and stuff [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2557.3399999999997s)]
*  Which should be handled at the state level [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2559.3399999999997s)]
*  And he looked at me and said [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2560.46s)]
*  You're right [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2562.46s)]
*  He said I'd vote against this too [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2563.46s)]
*  If it weren't my bill [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2564.46s)]
*  He said the leadership gave it to me [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2565.46s)]
*  And told me to bring it to the floor [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2567.46s)]
*  And it would help me get reelected [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2570.46s)]
*  Wow [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2572.46s)]
*  I swear to the Lord above [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2575.46s)]
*  That was an exact conversation I had on the floor [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2578.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2580.46s)]
*  Oh I believe you did [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2581.46s)]
*  Congressman from Wisconsin [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2582.46s)]
*  He's still there [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2583.46s)]
*  He is? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2584.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2585.46s)]
*  White guy I bet, huh? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2586.46s)]
*  Oh yeah [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2587.46s)]
*  That was a guess, dude [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2588.46s)]
*  That was a guess [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2589.58s)]
*  By the way [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2591.58s)]
*  But not to pick on him [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2592.58s)]
*  Because that year [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2593.58s)]
*  We passed like 38 opioid bills [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2594.58s)]
*  They're all redundant [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2596.58s)]
*  They just gave everybody [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2597.58s)]
*  They were trying to get reelected [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2598.58s)]
*  They give them an opioid bill [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2599.58s)]
*  Oh yeah [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2600.58s)]
*  I mean they were renewing more prescriptions [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2601.58s)]
*  For opioid bills than they were opioids [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2602.58s)]
*  That's the craziest part of it [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2606.58s)]
*  And the Sackler family never even went to fucking jail [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2607.58s)]
*  And some people believe that the Sackler family [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2610.58s)]
*  Should be electrocuted [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2613.58s)]
*  Allegedly [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2614.58s)]
*  I don't know him [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2615.58s)]
*  And I don't even know if electricity [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2616.58s)]
*  Would work on their fucking sick evil body [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2617.58s)]
*  That's the craziest part of it [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2618.7s)]
*  Is that Slander for saying that? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2620.7s)]
*  Can I go to jail for saying that? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2621.7s)]
*  I'm like a death threat huh? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2622.7s)]
*  You can but I can't [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2623.7s)]
*  So maybe I should say it [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2624.7s)]
*  There's something in the Constitution [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2625.7s)]
*  Called the speech or debate clause [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2626.7s)]
*  And so I can go to the floor [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2628.7s)]
*  Of the House of Representatives and lie [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2629.7s)]
*  I can tell every lie I want [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2631.7s)]
*  And nobody can do anything about it [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2633.7s)]
*  And it's called the speech or debate clause [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2635.7s)]
*  Our staff [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2637.7s)]
*  Yeah look this up [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2638.7s)]
*  The speech or debate clause [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2639.7s)]
*  Found in article 1 section 6 [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2640.7s)]
*  Of the US Constitution [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2642.7s)]
*  Protects members of parliament [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2643.7s)]
*  And police [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2644.7s)]
*  Protects members of parliament [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2646.7s)]
*  protects members of Congress from being questioned in any other place for their [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2647.7s)]
*  speech or debate in either house. So let me read it again. Protects members of [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2651.3999999999996s)]
*  Congress from being questioned in any other place. Which means you can't be [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2655.58s)]
*  questioned in a courtroom, you can't be sued, you can't be... Now read the next [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2659.8799999999997s)]
*  sentence though because there's a good reason for it. This clause rooted in [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2665.08s)]
*  historical struggles for parliamentary independence aims to safeguard the [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2668.64s)]
*  independence and integrity of the legislative branch by preventing [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2672.48s)]
*  interference from the executive or judicial branches. So when people... [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2676.56s)]
*  Even our founders... This is a hard pill to swallow. Okay. But even... I'm still a bit [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  confused at this moment. Well even our founders thought that there were some [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2689.36s)]
*  laws that shouldn't apply to congressmen because if they did they would get [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2694.08s)]
*  abused and like a Democrat president would arrest members of Congress for [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2697.88s)]
*  saying things on the floor of the house because it happened... That's what the [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2703.96s)]
*  King did back in England. The King would arrest members of Parliament if he [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2707.6s)]
*  didn't like what they said. Ah, I see what you're saying. Or you could get a private [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2711.8s)]
*  individual to sue a member of Congress for something they said and then that [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2715.56s)]
*  would basically freeze the debate and members of Congress would be afraid to [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2721.16s)]
*  speak. They would send their speeches to lawyers before they said them, you know, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2726.16s)]
*  if this didn't exist. I see what you're saying. So this is kind of a fascinating little [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2731.32s)]
*  part of our Constitution and even though it seems wrong to give members of [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2736.0s)]
*  Congress extra First Amendment protection, the founders thought this was [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2741.48s)]
*  the best way to do it. So you could go to court right now and lie on the [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2746.2000000000003s)]

*  it has to be attached to my official business. So I'm probably covered on [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2757.52s)]
*  social media and I could just say defamatory things about you. I could [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2762.52s)]
*  release national secrets and this also covers my staff as well. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2769.36s)]
*  Hmm. God, interesting. But can you... But am I gonna go to Jeffer Callum, the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2775.44s)]
*  Sackler of St. Louis? Probably. They got electrocuted? Yeah, probably. Shit. So what do I do? Do I bleep it out? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2780.92s)]
*  No, you need to run for Congress. Oh, that's hilarious, dude. And I only say, I [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2785.64s)]
*  don't really even say those words myself. I just say that on the, this is the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2792.3599999999997s)]
*  spirit of hundreds of thousands of opioid addicts who died channeling [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2795.92s)]
*  through me for just a brief second. Forgive me. I'm back. All right. It starts [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2799.8399999999997s)]
*  to feel like neither party... Wait, wait. So could I... I'm thinking about this. Could [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2806.24s)]
*  Mike Johnson put a bill on the floor about the omnibus thing? Yeah. And then we [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2815.84s)]
*  could see who would vote for it and vote against it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He could, but [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2823.1600000000003s)]
*  he's not going to. Right, because it would be too dangerous. It's way too [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2828.36s)]
*  dangerous. I mean, the lobbyists love it that way. Yeah. They love the [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2832.36s)]
*  opaqueness of that black box that Americans can't look into it and see [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2836.52s)]
*  what's going on. Because they're inside the black box. They get to craft language [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2840.24s)]
*  and special provisions in those big giant bills and they're so big and [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2845.64s)]
*  we're not given time to read them. But you got to remember, Theo, like a [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2849.9199999999996s)]
*  lot of my colleagues wouldn't read these bills even if they were given three [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2853.9199999999996s)]
*  months to read them. What they're doing by rushing these bills [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2857.04s)]
*  through is they're not who doing the congressman, they're who doing the public. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2860.6s)]
*  Of course. No, I think it makes perfect sense. It's like, because we just send one [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2864.12s)]
*  set of eyes and brain up there to handle something, or a couple sets, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2867.6s)]
*  if you have a few reps. But it's so much information at once. It's all [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2871.68s)]
*  the same thing. It's literally like a bus passing by. It's like with a car passing [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2876.24s)]
*  by, you can get an idea of what's on. You can look at the wheels, you can check the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2881.4s)]
*  exhaust, you might be able to see who's in there. But when a bus goes by, you're like, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2884.7599999999998s)]
*  fuck, I don't know. Was a driver awake? That's kind of like, that's how it [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2887.8399999999997s)]
*  certainly starts to appear. And the windows are painted black on the bus. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2892.0s)]
*  And somebody wrote, just married to a trans man on the windows with chalk or [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2896.32s)]
*  whatever with window paint. Here's my question. Is anybody representing the [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2902.6400000000003s)]
*  people anymore? Because it kind of feels like it used to feel like you at the [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2908.0s)]
*  parties were against each other. And now it feels like it's the government versus [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2911.6400000000003s)]
*  the people. That's what it feels like. I think it is. I mean, I call it the [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2916.6400000000003s)]
*  Uniparty. Last year, Marjorie Taylor Greene and I introduced a resolution to [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2921.12s)]
*  oust Mike Johnson. After Mike Johnson put a bill on the floor and was the tie [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2928.84s)]
*  breaking vote to send more money to Ukraine. After he passed another omnibus, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2934.88s)]
*  after he passed another bill to spy on Americans using mostly Democrat votes, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2939.92s)]
*  because a lot of Republicans are waking up to that and didn't vote for it. After [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2945.36s)]
*  he did like three or four really bad things, Marjorie and I put a resolution on [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2949.12s)]
*  the floor. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2953.08s)]
*  Which you think are bad things, right? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2953.56s)]
*  I think they're bad things. Spying on Americans, sending all the money to [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2954.88s)]
*  Ukraine. Yeah, I think they are. I think they're not Republican priorities. And so [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2959.08s)]
*  and he's a Republican speaker. So we put a resolution on the floor to vacate the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2964.2799999999997s)]
*  Speaker's office. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2969.24s)]
*  What does that mean? To get a new speaker? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2971.16s)]
*  Get a new speaker. And typically no Democrat will vote for that. And if you [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2972.6s)]
*  doesn't have enough Republicans to sustain that vote, he will lose and get a [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2979.04s)]
*  new speaker. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2983.12s)]
*  Why would no Democrat vote for that? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2983.8s)]
*  Well, for the first time in history, they did. Like they did vote to keep Mike [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2985.6s)]
*  Johnson. Because it was as good as they've ever had it. They were getting [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2990.2799999999997s)]
*  everything they wanted. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2994.8s)]
*  You believe he was helping their party? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2995.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was helping their party. So they kept him in power. So it is really hard [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=2997.12s)]
*  to change things. You can occasionally get people to try but the consequences of [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3002.08s)]
*  trying and losing can be great. Like they call up all the lobbyists and say quit [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3007.44s)]
*  giving money to that member of Congress. They'll call up donors in your district. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3013.56s)]
*  They'll call up constituents and have constituents call you up. Or the new [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3018.6s)]
*  thing recently is to fund social media campaigns. The NRCC, National Republican [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3023.48s)]
*  Congressional Committee, they spend money on Twitter influencers who then do [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3030.04s)]
*  things against who knows what. I mean, they're directing them. That part isn't [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3035.84s)]
*  transparent. But it's directed toward me, for instance, our own party is [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3040.36s)]
*  coordinating efforts against me. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3047.36s)]
*  Well, then at that point, that's what I'm saying. It's there's a party that's it's [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3048.92s)]
*  them against you. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3052.04s)]
*  Which is OK. I've got a thick skin. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3053.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. But I'm just saying it feels like it's it feels like it's you guys are [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3055.1200000000003s)]
*  playing this game, but it's all against the voter. None of it is for the voter [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3057.88s)]
*  anymore. It doesn't you know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah, it feels like I [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3062.44s)]
*  don't know. It just feels like it's it's it's the voter against the politicians. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3066.16s)]
*  And it's it just starts to feel really, really scary for sure. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3071.16s)]
*  Have you thought about becoming an independent or is that not a is that is [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3074.96s)]
*  that is that is that death? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3078.32s)]
*  I I've thought about it a lot. And one of the things that surprised me when I got [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3080.12s)]
*  to Congress is there's two of everything. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3085.7200000000003s)]
*  So there's two cloakrooms. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3089.0s)]
*  There's a Democrat cloakroom. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3090.28s)]
*  We say that part again. There's a Democrat cloakroom and a Republican cloakroom. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3092.32s)]
*  This is like when you show up to vote. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3095.88s)]
*  There's a little clubhouse, two little clubhouses attached to Congress. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3098.2400000000002s)]
*  You can go back there and get a hot dog and a hot ham and cheese and ice cream [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3102.44s)]
*  sandwich. Oh, yeah. Get a hot blonde. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3107.0s)]
*  That is our cloakroom right there on the right. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3109.76s)]
*  Is that really? Yeah. You go back there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3111.44s)]
*  Although there's some computers as well. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3113.7200000000003s)]
*  That's looking in one direction. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3115.44s)]
*  If you look in the other direction, there's a sandwich. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3116.64s)]
*  They're not showing the sandwich bar. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3119.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I'd love. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, there's a sandwich bar. Yeah, that's it. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3124.12s)]
*  Oh, that's it. Yeah. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3126.04s)]
*  Now, that's the old. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3127.96s)]
*  That's the Democrat cloakroom. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3129.7599999999998s)]
*  The Republican one looks just the same. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3131.44s)]
*  OK. OK. But here's the thing. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3133.52s)]
*  La Mortadella. There's only two cloakrooms. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3135.4s)]
*  So if you were truly independent and you came to Congress, there'd be nowhere to [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3139.72s)]
*  get a hot dog or to call. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3144.3599999999997s)]
*  People go in there and call their lobbyist friends. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3147.2s)]
*  Like during votes, you'll get a call and they'll say, hey, don't there vote [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3150.2s)]
*  for this or maybe they'll call up a member of Congress. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3155.3599999999997s)]
*  They'll go to the cloakroom, call and ask for advice. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3158.3199999999997s)]
*  In any case, there's also things called back rooms on every committee. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3160.24s)]
*  You've heard of backroom deals. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3164.12s)]
*  Mm hmm. I couldn't believe it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3165.48s)]
*  When I got to Congress, people are using the word backroom because there are back [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3166.96s)]
*  rooms behind the committee rooms where you go back and do your huddle. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3170.96s)]
*  But there's only two huddles. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3175.8s)]
*  There's the Democrat huddle and the Republican huddle. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3177.12s)]
*  And there's only two back rooms. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3179.36s)]
*  So I say if you were an independent, you're going against the architecture. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3181.12s)]
*  It's not just tradition. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3186.48s)]
*  It's built into marble and oak. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3188.2000000000003s)]
*  There can only be two parties. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3191.44s)]
*  That's how strong they have put it in. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3193.52s)]
*  You know, and if you're bipartisan, that means you you like both parties. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3195.88s)]
*  I say that if you're I'm not bipartisan, I'm transpartisan. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3200.28s)]
*  Trans means you can't identify with either. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3205.32s)]
*  Some days I don't know which cloakroom to go into. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3207.52s)]
*  Wow. Some days they don't want me in either cloakroom. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3209.6s)]
*  So I feel like I'm a transpartisan. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3212.36s)]
*  Well, this is busy out in the van outside. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3214.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, that's right. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3217.08s)]
*  Some days I have gone out to the camper and just like drink some raw milk [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3218.0s)]
*  and just be like, we're so screwed. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3222.44s)]
*  Let's go back in and try it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3224.84s)]
*  But I think it is hard. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3226.72s)]
*  It would be really hard to have an independent party [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3228.24s)]
*  or to get elected as an independent. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3233.08s)]
*  I think. Yes, that's true. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3235.12s)]
*  But but never forget this. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3237.3199999999997s)]
*  There's really like six parties up there in D.C. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3238.8399999999997s)]
*  and they've been shoehorned into two different cloakrooms. Right. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3241.9199999999996s)]
*  And so you got to pick which and so either way, if you had a separate party, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3245.3199999999997s)]
*  you're kind of still in one cloakroom or the other. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3249.9199999999996s)]
*  He's kind of still in one huddle of the other. Yeah. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3251.72s)]
*  So there's there's a a guy from Maine. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3253.92s)]
*  His name's Angus King. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3257.84s)]
*  He's a senator and he runs as an independent and he and he gets elected [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3258.88s)]
*  as an independent. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3262.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he goes in the Democrat cloakroom. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3263.84s)]
*  So, yeah, that's him. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3266.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He definitely looks like a Maine guy. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3267.28s)]
*  So he gets elected. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3270.08s)]
*  Undeniably wears a raincoat at night. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3271.36s)]
*  You may you may have heard the term rhino Republican in name only. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3273.84s)]
*  I have a friend who calls him an I know an independent in name only [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3278.44s)]
*  because he gets elected as an independent. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3281.84s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders did this, too. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3284.44s)]
*  And then caucuses with the Democrats. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3286.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, I've been involved with different financial groups [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3289.6800000000003s)]

*  So one of the ways and I wrote some of my questions down today. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3458.4s)]
*  One of the big things that people talk about all the time these days are lobbyists, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3461.4s)]
*  right, and lobbies and how much of an effect that they have on our [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3464.2s)]
*  elected officials. How much is it? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3469.44s)]
*  I mean, how much of these packs really controlling things? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3472.24s)]
*  Quite a bit. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3476.4s)]
*  There's some aspects of lobbying that people don't think about. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3477.44s)]
*  Like, for instance, I think there are just as many lobbyists over at the White [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3480.84s)]
*  House as they are in Congress because a lot. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3484.64s)]
*  What do you mean that some people are almost as elected lobbyists? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3487.28s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3489.8s)]
*  They spend their time talking to White House officials because even though we're [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  the legislators, the White House sends recommendations for bills. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3497.4s)]
*  And if the same party is in power in the White House and in Congress, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3501.64s)]
*  like the big, beautiful bill, for instance, the legislation can initiate over [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3506.48s)]
*  in the White House. And so lobbyists, I'm just saying, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3511.4s)]
*  if you think of lobbyists talking to your senator and your congressman, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3515.72s)]
*  they're all over D.C. They're talking to bureaucrats. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3519.12s)]
*  They're talking to people, cabinet secretaries, because they know [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3521.56s)]
*  it's sometimes easier to get written into the budget if they're over there [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3526.24s)]
*  lobbying. Another thing to know about lobbyists. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3530.08s)]
*  I mean, there's lobbyists for the Alzheimer's victims or people who have [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3532.56s)]
*  Alzheimer's. There are lobbyists. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3538.0s)]
*  Yeah, there are lobbyists for people with rare blood disorders. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3541.0s)]
*  OK, there's lobbyists for the Concrete Association. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3544.48s)]
*  If there is a group of people, they have lobbyists. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3548.48s)]
*  And so there are in some people's enemies, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3552.7599999999998s)]
*  lobbyist enemies or other people's lobbying friends like there are pro Second [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3557.4s)]
*  Amendment lobbyists who are up there fighting for the Second Amendment. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3561.64s)]
*  And the Democrats hate those lobbyists, but those are lobbyists the Republicans [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3565.8399999999997s)]
*  kind of like. So the question is, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3570.2799999999997s)]
*  and sometimes my constituents, they don't know how to get to D.C. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3575.4s)]
*  and how to talk to all the congressmen from Kentucky and both senators. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3579.16s)]
*  And so they hire lobbyists to come and do that. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3582.92s)]
*  I don't know that I would outlaw lobbyists. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3587.2s)]
*  Sometimes they're actually helpful. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3589.88s)]
*  Like, let's say the concrete lobbyists. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3592.28s)]
*  You got the concrete lobbyists fighting with the asphalt lobbyists on [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3595.0800000000004s)]
*  what's going to be the road surface. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3600.04s)]
*  OK, well, if all you hear is from the asphalt lobbyists, you would just buy [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3602.92s)]
*  asphalt and then you hear from the concrete lobbyists. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3607.52s)]
*  And so it's really to get to the truth. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3610.88s)]
*  You need adversarial opinions. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3613.48s)]
*  The problem is, I wouldn't blame the lobbyists for advocating [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3616.2400000000002s)]
*  for their group of people. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3621.7200000000003s)]
*  I would blame the congressmen who basically put that crap in the bills. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3624.0s)]
*  And again, I would go back to separating the votes. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3630.1200000000003s)]
*  How do you know that your congressman is sold out to Big Pharma, for instance, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3634.2400000000002s)]
*  if Big Pharma is only one one tenth of the bill. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3639.88s)]
*  Right. And there's pay raises for veterans. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3643.48s)]
*  So they can hide the fact that they're selling out over here by buying in over here. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3646.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3650.88s)]
*  God, it almost sounds fun. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3652.44s)]
*  Now, there's one group of lobbyists I don't think really should exist [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3655.36s)]
*  or should have access to U.S. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3661.2400000000002s)]
*  offices, and those are foreign lobbyists. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3664.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I've heard you talk about this before and I've heard a lot of people are [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3666.36s)]
*  talking about it now. It's definitely become a hot topic. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3669.5600000000004s)]
*  And APAC is one of the big ones. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3671.7999999999997s)]
*  And that stands for American, Israeli, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3674.08s)]
*  political. It's not a fund. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3679.04s)]
*  It didn't start out as a super PAC. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3681.92s)]
*  So political action committee, public affairs committee, public affairs committee, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3683.8399999999997s)]
*  American Israel Public Affairs Committee. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3689.16s)]
*  Now, a lot of times PAC stands for political action committee, like you said. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3691.44s)]
*  But these guys were started before there were political action committees. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3695.04s)]
*  So it stands for public affairs committee. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3698.2799999999997s)]
*  Got it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3700.2s)]
*  They brag that they've spent more on elections than any other lobbying group. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3702.2799999999997s)]
*  In the world? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3709.08s)]
*  In the United States, in Congress. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3710.48s)]
*  OK. They now do have a political action committee. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3713.64s)]
*  And I forget what the name of it is. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3718.52s)]
*  So APAC has a subsidiary that spends money to basically crack heads of congressmen. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3720.72s)]
*  So there's two kinds of, by the way, there are two kinds of lobbying groups. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3729.8799999999997s)]
*  There's access lobbying. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3734.2s)]
*  That's where they're all your friends. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3736.16s)]
*  They're never mean to you. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3739.12s)]
*  They would even if they don't like you, they'll buy you a steak dinner and they'll try to [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3740.44s)]
*  get you to hear out their point of view. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3745.16s)]
*  And they figure as long as I can get in that person's office, I'm doing well for the [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3747.72s)]
*  people I'm lobbying for. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3752.8399999999997s)]
*  But then there are confrontational lobbyists like APAC. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3754.0s)]
*  And APAC has transitioned into a confrontational lobbying group where if you don't do [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3759.0s)]
*  what they want, they come after you. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3764.1200000000003s)]
*  Wow. What does it look like? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3766.0s)]
*  They spent four hundred thousand dollars against me in my last election. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3767.6400000000003s)]
*  And they are basically advertise themselves as just all things Israel. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3771.7200000000003s)]
*  They are lobbying for more money to go to Israel, which all the money we give to Israel [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3777.2400000000002s)]
*  is military money. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3783.68s)]
*  So they are basically lobbyists for the military industrial complex. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3785.3999999999996s)]
*  Got it. Understood. So and I'll ask you some questions about that, the military industrial [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3789.2s)]
*  complex in a few minutes. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3793.3599999999997s)]
*  But do you feel like Israel is a fair ally or they are a good ally for us? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3794.6s)]
*  Well, or is that too general of a question? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3799.96s)]
*  Well, I think it doesn't matter. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3802.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, there's no big, giant Great Britain lobby. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3803.7999999999997s)]
*  There's no Australian lobby. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3806.8799999999997s)]
*  There's no German lobby. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3808.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, the other countries don't have them. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3809.72s)]
*  No, no, not like this. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3811.08s)]
*  This is singular. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3812.56s)]
*  This is unique. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3813.96s)]
*  I mean, if you're an ally, why wouldn't we work with you? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3816.52s)]
*  Why do you have to convince us that you're our ally? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3819.08s)]
*  Why do you have to basically go into every congressional office and convince them? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3822.4s)]
*  And it's because they want to keep the money flowing and that they've got a good [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3827.12s)]
*  return on their investment. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3833.36s)]
*  I mean, we send more foreign aid to Israel than to any other country. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3834.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're, you know, like 10 million people or something. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3838.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think Tennessee, I don't know this population in Tennessee, but it's probably [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3843.04s)]
*  about, you know, on that order. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3847.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think this year they said we spent like 12 billion dollars, but that's not [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3848.96s)]
*  actual dollars. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3851.68s)]
*  It's in military aid, right? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3852.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's well, it's dollars and munitions and treasury. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3854.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3858.44s)]
*  But it's not like we give them, it's a, it's a gift certificate that's redeemable at [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3859.0s)]
*  Lockheed Martin and your local Raytheon, you know. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3864.48s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3867.72s)]
*  So that's kind of how that works. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3868.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3869.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3870.12s)]
*  Got it. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3870.36s)]
*  Um, why, yeah, why do they have this, uh, carve out that's just for them? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3871.0s)]
*  Like, what, like, what do we get from Israel? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3877.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you feel like? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3879.64s)]
*  Uh, we got a lot of countries that hate us is one of the things we get. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3882.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, well, especially right now with this stuff in Gaza, it's, I think it's Israel's, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3886.3999999999996s)]
*  it's one of the worst PR campaigns I've ever seen in my life. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3891.16s)]
*  If they're even, I haven't, it doesn't make any sense to me. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3893.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like, I just don't, it gives their government this extremely evil look to me, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3896.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, and I think to a lot of people, you know. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3903.6s)]
*  Well, rough numbers, there are 2 million people in Gaza and 50,000 have been killed. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3905.8399999999997s)]
*  That's two and a half percent. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3912.64s)]
*  Like they've killed one in 40 people in Gaza. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3914.3599999999997s)]
*  If you, if you did that in the United States, if you did two and a half percent [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3917.4799999999996s)]
*  of, of 350 million, it'd be almost 10 million people. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3922.12s)]
*  In the United States, everybody in Gaza is at this point related to somebody who's been [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3926.48s)]
*  killed, like at least the first cousin had killed. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3932.8s)]
*  And then if you say how many have been maimed, it's probably three or four times that. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3936.32s)]
*  So everybody in Gaza knows people who've been killed in Maine. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3940.52s)]
*  And we're supporting it, right? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3944.56s)]
*  That's the also the part that makes it really tough sometimes to just be a person. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3945.84s)]
*  It's like, we are tax money is going towards this, but I just hope that. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3951.48s)]
*  People in some of these other countries know that, you know, it's not regular, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3956.0s)]
*  everyday people who would want to do these things, you know, that it's like [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3960.1200000000003s)]
*  governments making these choices and it's a corporate interests that make these choices. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3963.08s)]
*  How do we, how would we stop it? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3967.84s)]
*  Well, do we need this connection with Israel? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3969.6800000000003s)]
*  What is it? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3972.1200000000003s)]
*  No one ever explains what it's for. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3972.52s)]
*  I feel like, right. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3974.48s)]
*  That would help everybody have a much better understanding, you know, because it [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3975.52s)]
*  starts to feel like America is just a shell company, an LLC for Israel. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3978.92s)]
*  That's what it starts to feel like a lot of times, you know. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3984.4s)]
*  Do you feel like that that's realistic or do you feel like that that's off base? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3987.52s)]
*  I would, I wouldn't send them a dime. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3990.7200000000003s)]
*  Like that's my position. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3992.88s)]
*  I don't think whatever we're getting isn't worth it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3994.7200000000003s)]
*  And don't ask me to articulate the benefit because I think the cost is greater than the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=3998.28s)]
*  benefit you get. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4003.2000000000003s)]
*  Everybody in Gaza is at this point has to hate Israel. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4004.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4008.36s)]
*  And by extension, those bombs, when they see American politicians go over there and [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4009.08s)]
*  like sign the fricking bombs that are going to kill women and children. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4013.12s)]
*  What are we actually, there was just a clip with Ted Cruz that came out. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4017.8399999999997s)]
*  Can you see if you can find that Trevin where, yeah, where Tucker Carlson was [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4020.96s)]
*  interviewing Ted Cruz. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4025.56s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4026.56s)]
*  This is a scary interview during the Tucker Carlson interview with Ted Cruz. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4027.08s)]
*  It's confirmed Israel's version of the CIA called Mossad spies. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4030.6s)]
*  Oh, it's about spying. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4034.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like what we get. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4035.3599999999997s)]
*  Let's, let's just watch it for a second. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4036.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4037.6s)]

*  Oh, probably not, but they share a lot. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4040.72s)]
*  Um, we don't share all of our intelligence with them, but we share a lot. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4042.84s)]
*  It's a close ally. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4045.4s)]
*  Do they spy domestically in the United States? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4046.36s)]
*  Oh, they probably do. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4048.6400000000003s)]
*  And we do as well. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4049.6800000000003s)]
*  And friends and allies spy on each other. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4050.5600000000004s)]
*  And I assume, I assume all of our allies spy on us. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4052.4s)]
*  That's okay with you. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4055.1600000000003s)]
*  You know what? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4056.8s)]
*  One of the things about being a conservative is that you're not naive and utopian. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4057.5600000000004s)]

*  It's why the market works to pay people to spy on you. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4075.16s)]
*  It's conservative to recognize that human beings act to their own self-interest and [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4078.2799999999997s)]

*  That's my question. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4085.68s)]
*  I'm not asking whether they have motive to do it. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4086.48s)]

*  Um, it is an America's interest to be closely allied with Israel because we get [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4109.360000000001s)]

*  No, not yours. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4136.679999999999s)]
*  Like it's a lot of effort to anybody can be hacked. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4137.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4141.8s)]
*  Oh, I thought one of the reasons I got to go to Qatar recently, I'm [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4142.08s)]
*  wondering if they hacked my phone. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4144.28s)]

*  That's what I'm thinking. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4150.28s)]
*  I just seemed like everything's hacked now. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4150.8s)]
*  I get scared, you know, but, but, um, if you're not the Israeli. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4152.5199999999995s)]

*  But probably Israel and Russia and China aren't devoting that effort and internet [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4162.88s)]
*  traffic, which can become detectable to us too. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4169.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4173.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4173.5599999999995s)]
*  But, um, you're probably, you know, why wouldn't you be trying to hear what the [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4174.0s)]
*  535 people in Washington, DC who vote on bills, what they are thinking. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4180.76s)]
*  Um, and then, you know, also there, uh, there are, um, allegedly some [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4187.0s)]
*  congressmen who indulge in insider trading, but I would guess that there [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4193.599999999999s)]
*  are probably some hackers who are also inside a congressman's phones trying to [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4197.92s)]
*  figure out what the sentiment is in Washington, DC, and then trading on that. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4202.719999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4206.599999999999s)]
*  So there's always this extra layer kind of going along, going on, it feels like. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4208.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4212.28s)]
*  Um, but what do you think we get from Israel? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4212.44s)]
*  I think it's just a big question. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4214.4s)]
*  I think it's okay as a regular person and I might get killed or something by [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4215.56s)]
*  Masad or something, but what do we get from them as a country? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4219.080000000001s)]
*  Like, is there, I think there's just, that's a big question America has right now. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4222.240000000001s)]
*  Is there something we just don't see? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4225.280000000001s)]
*  And if there is, just tell us what it is so we can, um, operate accordingly, you know? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4226.8s)]
*  No, I think they're the best, uh, lobbying group in Washington, DC. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4232.240000000001s)]
*  And the reason they can do it is you have, uh, dual citizens, people who are [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4238.72s)]
*  American and Israeli who are allowed to give money into American politics and [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4244.0s)]
*  because they're American and by virtue of that, you're allowed to participate. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4251.28s)]
*  But if you're a foreign national, you're not allowed to. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4254.84s)]
*  So they're one of the few countries that can donate money to what? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4257.52s)]
*  To super PACs, to members of Congress. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4261.92s)]
*  Other countries aren't allowed to do that. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4264.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, they could if you were dual citizens, but there's not so [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4265.96s)]
*  many dual citizens as it were. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4269.08s)]
*  But, but could somebody be a Russian and American dual citizen and [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4272.24s)]
*  serve in, and serve in a Congress or? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4275.72s)]
*  Sure. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4278.56s)]
*  And donate to Congressman. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4279.12s)]
*  Um, by the way, I have introduced a bill that would require members of Congress [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4281.48s)]
*  to disclose if they are dual citizens. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4286.64s)]
*  And I think that's only fair. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4289.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4291.4s)]
*  Cause right now you could have allegiance to another country, not just the USA. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4291.56s)]
*  Correct. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4295.04s)]
*  We swear an allegiance when you're a member of Congress to the constitution. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  I always like to point this out. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4299.16s)]
*  We're not swearing it to the country. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4300.5199999999995s)]
*  We're not swearing it to the president. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4302.28s)]
*  We're not swearing it to our party. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4304.32s)]
*  We swear it to the constitution. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4305.5599999999995s)]
*  And other countries have constitutions too. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4307.96s)]
*  What if you've taken allegiance to two different constitutions? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4310.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the American, I'm not, and I'm not even, my bill wouldn't even keep you [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4314.719999999999s)]
*  from being a member of Congress. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4318.08s)]
*  It would just say you have to disclose it if you are. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4319.44s)]
*  And it, and by the way, it wouldn't necessarily just be Israel members of [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4322.44s)]
*  Congress who are also citizens of Israel. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4327.8s)]
*  It could be other countries as well. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4331.56s)]
*  I just think it creates a conflict of interest. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4333.4800000000005s)]
*  And you know, I have to disclose yearly which stocks I own. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4336.96s)]
*  I have to disclose all my personal financial information so that the [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4341.92s)]
*  voters can decide if I am unduly influenced by that conflict of interest. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4346.88s)]
*  And so that's the structure of my bill. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4354.400000000001s)]
*  My bill just, it's a, an election disclosure. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4356.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4359.200000000001s)]
*  You're running for Congress. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4359.56s)]
*  Bring it up. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4360.52s)]
*  Tell us, tell us which countries you are a representative. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4361.080000000001s)]
*  Thomas Massey announces the introduction of HR 2356, the dual loyalty disclosure [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4366.360000000001s)]
*  act representative Massey's legislation amends a federal election campaign act [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4372.360000000001s)]
*  to require candidates for federal office to disclose both their possession of dual [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4376.96s)]
*  citizenship and also the foreign country in which their dual citizenship is held. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4381.160000000001s)]
*  So right now we don't have to know people don't have to disclose. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4385.12s)]
*  Nope. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4390.0s)]
*  They don't. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4390.4800000000005s)]
*  You would have no idea. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4391.88s)]
*  Have you seen spies like us, dude? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4393.84s)]
*  It's also by the way, it's a safety net, by the way, if you, if something went [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4397.08s)]
*  really bad, you could just go live in your other country. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4401.68s)]
*  I think you should be all in for this country. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4404.56s)]
*  I agree. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4407.72s)]
*  This ain't the fucking hokey pokey dude. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4408.28s)]
*  I think you got to have both feet in or both feet out. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4410.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4414.08s)]
*  Dude, I just, and, but, but, but any country, this could happen. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4414.8s)]
*  It could be, it's, that's not just Israel. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4420.8s)]
*  Correct. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4422.88s)]
*  It could be any country. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4423.400000000001s)]
*  It could be, but Israel is the only one that has a big lobby. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4424.4400000000005s)]
*  So for the Russian, like Russia pack or whatever. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4427.4400000000005s)]
*  No, there is not. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4430.68s)]
*  Like I say, there's not even Australia pack or, or great Britain pack. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4432.2s)]
*  I mean, because they're natural allies. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4438.2s)]
*  Why would they have to lobby Congress? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4441.68s)]
*  They're also not on our teeth, like asking for money. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4443.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4447.0s)]
*  But I think it's also, there's this, it's a weird amalgamation of, of combined [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4447.5599999999995s)]
*  interests, there's a military industrial complex that is all in for everything. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4452.599999999999s)]
*  APAC is for, and before I banned APAC from my office, we used to have [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4458.5199999999995s)]
*  conversations that would go something like this. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4463.44s)]
*  Oh, you should be for the foreign aid that goes to Israel because it all comes back [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4466.28s)]
*  to the United States in the form of military spending. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4471.16s)]
*  We're buying it all from American contractors and be like, no, that's [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4475.2s)]
*  not a convincing argument to me. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4480.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4482.639999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4483.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know what it's about, but it seems like bullshit to me. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4484.0s)]
*  Um, how, how does America make money off of war? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4487.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4491.2s)]
*  Like I get that, you know, we sell things, this and that, but how is that such a [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4491.599999999999s)]
*  business, right? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4496.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, it's like, how do we let this happen? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4497.4s)]
*  Well, the answer is America doesn't make money off of war. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4499.4400000000005s)]
*  A few people in America do make money off of war and they make a lot of money [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4503.32s)]
*  off of war, so they want the music to keep going. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4507.52s)]
*  They don't want the music to stop. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4510.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4512.28s)]
*  And as soon as, um, you know, Biden was serious about getting out of Afghanistan, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4512.92s)]
*  um, and did get us out of Afghanistan. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4519.84s)]
*  And we were spending, by the way, we were still spending $50 billion a year in [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4522.56s)]
*  Afghanistan after 20 years, as soon as he got us out of there, guess what? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4527.12s)]
*  We start spending an average of $50 billion a year in Ukraine. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4532.04s)]
*  And now that that's winding down, guess what? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4536.32s)]
*  This thing in Iran is heating up and regardless of whether our troops engage [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4539.4s)]
*  directly, those are all American munitions and those stocks are, you know, the [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4544.5199999999995s)]
*  people who run those companies are excited that now, you know, as soon as we [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4550.32s)]
*  deplete our stockpiles, we're going to have to fill them back up. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4556.84s)]
*  Like, it's not like they're holding a bunch of inventory, but the US government [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4560.64s)]
*  does, those are ostensibly, those are weapons that are supposed to defend us. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4564.6s)]
*  Um, that are now being used. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4569.28s)]
*  And so they know we'll buy them back. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4570.88s)]
*  And I, I have this theory that there's about $50 billion a year of things that [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4573.0s)]
*  need to get blown up and replaced in order for that segment of the economy to stay [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4578.88s)]
*  healthy. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4584.32s)]
*  And then there was a real push to get out of Ukraine to quit spending money there. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4585.36s)]
*  And we almost succeeded. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4591.96s)]
*  Like I said before, the tie breaking vote was Mike Johnson. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4593.5599999999995s)]
*  It was the bill passed by just one vote. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4597.08s)]
*  And a lot of times the speaker doesn't even vote, but he voted in that case to [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4599.84s)]
*  make sure that Ukraine got that money. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4604.04s)]
*  But isn't it, I mean, it's also, I think it's admirable that a guy is willing to [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4607.92s)]
*  go against their own party's interests. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4611.759999999999s)]
*  Right? Like that part to me seems like a part of it. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4613.96s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4616.76s)]
*  Like not just to be in line all the time with everything. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4618.0s)]
*  Well, that could be me sometimes. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4620.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4622.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4622.64s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4622.84s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4623.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4624.28s)]
*  So that's what I, that I think that's a little bit of the thing I don't get about [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4624.44s)]
*  some of this stuff. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4628.52s)]
*  Whenever we talk about Mike Johnson is like, if he, like there's, I think there's a [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4629.08s)]
*  difference in going against like, um, just what your party's going to do. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4632.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4636.6s)]
*  If you're, if you're staying true to your party's principles, I think it's admirable. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4637.16s)]
*  But when you're betraying your party's principles, I don't think it is because [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4641.639999999999s)]
*  you've campaigned on one thing and now you're doing something different. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4646.5199999999995s)]
*  Got it. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4649.28s)]
*  And, and the reality is the speaker has so much power up there. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4650.08s)]
*  He's in training, uh, dozens of more people who rely on him to get reelected. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4653.719999999999s)]
*  And the, the, by the way, the lobbyists, in addition to focusing on the executive [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4659.5199999999995s)]
*  branch, they spend a lot of their effort on the, um, on just the speaker [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4663.0s)]
*  and the speaker's office. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4668.5199999999995s)]
*  What do you, what do you think has kept us in our Ukraine so long? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4670.52s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, we want to be supportive of people that are struggling. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4673.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4677.12s)]
*  We want to help out people, you know, it feels like as an American, especially [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4677.320000000001s)]
*  that's part of like our creed and what you feel in your heart is like, if you [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4680.72s)]
*  can be helpful to another group. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4684.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4685.68s)]
*  Um, so I certainly see that as something that we want to keep involved in. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4686.320000000001s)]
*  Foreign conflicts, even though a lot of times I'm like, why are we involved in [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4692.92s)]
*  these conflicts over there? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4696.08s)]
*  What is it I think that I don't understand maybe about the, um, or about [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4697.24s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine, or do you think that that's part of just the military [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4700.88s)]
*  industrial tab that we have to fill? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4704.24s)]
*  I think we have agitated Russia to the point by expanding NATO. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4707.04s)]
*  Um, we just keep adding countries closer and closer to their backyard that are in [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4712.24s)]
*  a military alliance with us and, um, the situation in Ukraine, we also toppled [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4717.76s)]
*  their government in 2014, the United States did. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4724.76s)]
*  We did. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4728.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4729.360000000001s)]
*  Bring that up. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4730.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4730.76s)]
*  Bring that up. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4731.0s)]
*  You can, uh, see that the government changed there and we, we had our hands [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4733.4800000000005s)]
*  all over that. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4738.24s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4739.92s)]
*  In 2014, Ukraine experienced a period of intense political upheaval culminating [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4740.24s)]
*  in the removal of president Viktor Yanukovych. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4743.68s)]
*  Uh, the event often referred to as a revolution of dignity or euro mate [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4746.96s)]
*  my done involve widespread protests against Yanukovych's policies, particularly [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4751.0s)]
*  his decision to reject a trade agreement with the European union in favor of closer [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4755.52s)]
*  ties with Russia. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4758.88s)]
*  Um, so we didn't want them to have closer ties with Russia. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4760.52s)]
*  So we ever threw them. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4762.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4763.88s)]
*  I mean, we went in and fomented those protests. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4764.2s)]
*  Um, our CIA did our state department. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4767.92s)]
*  Um, you know, Victoria Newland was part of that. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4771.2s)]
*  So this was just another thing you think we started laying the seeds in [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4775.72s)]
*  advance to get, to get to this point. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4778.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4780.96s)]
*  I don't think it would have ever happened if, if we weren't involved in fomenting [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4781.16s)]
*  this and then talking about bringing them into NATO after we poked Putin in the eye [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4786.36s)]
*  here and the whole point was just to get to a war to help fill out the tab. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4790.84s)]
*  You're saying, yeah, that's, and that's a part of it. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4794.76s)]
*  Like that's, that's sort of Massey's law. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4797.6s)]
*  There has to be another, there has to be $50 billion of stuff that gets blown up. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4799.52s)]
*  That is made by American, uh, military industrial complex in order to keep them [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4804.24s)]
*  going and if it's not, they'll, they'll just spend more effort in making that [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4810.6s)]
*  happen rather than go out of business. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4816.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4819.64s)]
*  Oh, I think once you get used to something, you get used to it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4820.56s)]
*  Oh, here's the thing I was going to say before, when, when we got close to not [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4824.280000000001s)]
*  funding Ukraine under Mike Johnson, uh, the Biden administration sent a letter [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4828.0s)]
*  to Congress, to each of us, everybody in Congress got one of these letters, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4834.6s)]
*  listing all the states who had, they, they call it the defense industrial base now [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4838.44s)]
*  because military industrial complex has a bad connotation. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4843.92s)]
*  You need rebranding. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4847.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4847.68s)]
*  So it's dib, D I B the defense industrial base. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4847.96s)]
*  They showed how every, almost every state in the union benefits from military [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4852.08s)]
*  spending and why you should, that was their argument, not that there was some [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4858.76s)]
*  noble cause or to help out a struggling group of people, like you said, the [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4863.28s)]
*  argument that the Biden administration was making was it was in congressman's [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4867.6s)]
*  financial, the financial best interests of their districts in order to vote for [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4871.68s)]
*  this bill. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4876.56s)]
*  So at least now they're just saying it's, it's a business. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4878.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4880.68s)]
*  Give them an A for honesty. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4881.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4883.120000000001s)]
*  They're at least saying, yeah, feed the machine. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4884.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4885.72s)]
*  Feed the machine. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4885.92s)]
*  But doesn't that also cost human lives? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4886.72s)]
*  Like if our military has to get involved? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4888.4400000000005s)]
*  It does. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4890.64s)]
*  That's the, um, you know, these are now they're supposedly sanitary wars where [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4891.160000000001s)]
*  our kids don't have to die. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4897.0s)]
*  But I think it's disgusting. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4898.84s)]
*  Uh, when, you know, we've had members of the Senate at least say that, uh, this [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4901.24s)]
*  is great. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4907.64s)]
*  We're grinding down Russia's military capability and we don't have to spill any [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4908.32s)]
*  of our blood, but I mean, how perverted is that that you're, you're grinding up [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4913.44s)]
*  Ukrainians bodies in order to grind up Russian bodies and that somehow that's in [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4918.56s)]
*  the best interests of the United States. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4924.24s)]
*  I'll give, I don't want to say his name, but I'll give that Senator, uh, credit [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4926.48s)]
*  for being honest at least, but I think it's disgusting. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4931.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4936.16s)]
*  I mean, I think it's, we just have so much capability to manipulate so many [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4936.44s)]
*  situations, you know, and I don't understand, like, actually I, it's silly [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4939.88s)]
*  to say, I don't understand anymore. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4944.28s)]
*  If I believe that part of the military industrial complex or the defense [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4945.5599999999995s)]
*  industrial base industrial base needs to keep, uh, keep collecting, you know, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4950.24s)]
*  it makes sense. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4955.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a business. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4956.12s)]
*  Everything kind of, I mean, that's one of the downsides of capitalism, I guess, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4957.0s)]
*  you know, in a weird way is that everything kind of can become a business, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4960.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, even like the beauties of, um, trying to be, uh, supportive of other [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4963.04s)]
*  countries or trying to help out people, you know, um, and that's in addition to [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4969.24s)]
*  the trillion dollars a year we're now spending on the military in, in the [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4973.44s)]
*  United States, that's about what Congress allocates. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4978.16s)]
*  And this, this is all catching up to us because now the interest that we're [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4981.360000000001s)]
*  paying is about a trillion dollars a year. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4986.56s)]
*  So because we've engaged for two or three decades and all of these overseas wars, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4989.2s)]
*  we've racked up such a tab that we're paying more in interest than there you go. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=4995.4800000000005s)]
*  And we are in the military industrial complex and the, you know, on the screen [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5001.56s)]
*  there it says 849 billion. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5006.52s)]
*  Don't forget there's another hundred billion in the big, beautiful bill that [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5008.32s)]
*  they snuck in there and they sneak in another 50 billion somewhere else when, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5012.32s)]
*  um, so it's about a trillion, but look, look up the interest on the debt now too. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5017.16s)]
*  We're the interest on the debt. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5022.28s)]
*  It matches our GDP right now. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5023.88s)]
*  The interest, I think it's about 35 mil, 35 trillion a year is our, that's the [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5025.88s)]
*  debt, but the interest on the debt matches the, how much we spend on all of our [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5030.0s)]
*  defense, it's a trillion dollars. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5034.44s)]
*  If you look up interest, what's the interest on the debt last year? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5036.64s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5040.400000000001s)]
*  Um, do you think that we should have a war with Iran? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5042.04s)]
*  I know you got you and Ro Khanna, which is so crazy that he was here the other day. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5045.64s)]
*  And then here you are. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5049.160000000001s)]
*  Cause it was just like, what are the odds, you know, like, we didn't plan that [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5050.160000000001s)]
*  because we didn't know Israel was going to bomb Iran and that, oh no, a month [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5053.92s)]
*  ago, I knew that you were probably going to come. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5058.160000000001s)]
*  We've been talking about it, but then Ro, he and I just decided like five days ago. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5059.68s)]
*  So it was just crazy before I even knew that the bill that you guys had put [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5063.400000000001s)]
*  that together, um, he said that that made it so that the, there had to be a 15 day [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5066.52s)]
*  moratorium before you went to war. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5071.200000000001s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5073.320000000001s)]
*  Can you explain it to me? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5074.0s)]
*  Um, no, that we can get a vote within 15 days of, uh, of this bill being introduced. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5074.96s)]
*  And unless speaker Johnson does something sneaky. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5082.200000000001s)]
*  So there's a law that says if Ro Khanna and I, um, in which we did introduce this [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5085.4400000000005s)]
*  war powers resolution, the law says that speaker Johnson needs to bring this to the [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5092.56s)]
*  floor, uh, for a vote if the committee doesn't act on it and the committee's not [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5098.160000000001s)]
*  going to act on it, by the way, I introduced this on Tuesday. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5102.88s)]
*  Um, and it's just been a few days. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5108.320000000001s)]
*  We have 37 co-sponsors already. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5110.88s)]
*  Now, it, whether you think we should be engaged in a war with Iran or not, I would [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5113.8s)]
*  hope that your listeners understand that or agree that it's important that their [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5121.36s)]
*  members of Congress vote on whether that happens or not. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5126.36s)]
*  And before, just to give you some historical perspective, uh, before George Bush [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5129.88s)]
*  senior went attacked Iraq, there was a vote of Congress to do that. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5137.12s)]
*  It wasn't a declaration of war. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5142.5199999999995s)]
*  It was to authorize use of military force before George Bush Jr. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5144.04s)]
*  went into Afghanistan, there was a vote of Congress. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5149.04s)]
*  And before we went into Iraq again, there was a vote of Congress. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5151.88s)]
*  What's being discussed right now in the news is this notion that the president [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5156.32s)]
*  could just join in on the bombing of Iran without a vote of Congress. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5160.84s)]
*  It's the constitution requires Congress to vote. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5166.04s)]
*  Like that's our authority is to declare war. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5169.48s)]
*  So why do you need this bill then if it's already a law? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5173.36s)]
*  Well, this is, uh, this is prescribed by that law. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5176.120000000001s)]
*  Basically somebody has to bring it to a vote. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I stepped up and I asked Ro Khanna if he wanted to join me on this and he [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5183.280000000001s)]
*  did, and we've been collecting like a dozen co-sponsors a day since then. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5188.400000000001s)]
*  So it's you guys just saying, Hey guys, we have to vote on this. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5192.4400000000005s)]
*  We have to vote. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5194.280000000001s)]
*  They can't just say it and we have to do it. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5194.88s)]
*  Correct. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5196.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5196.84s)]
*  And what's funny is whenever it's the other guy in the white house, it's like, if a [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5197.400000000001s)]
*  Democrats in the white house, Republicans and the Democrat wants to wage war, the [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5203.56s)]
*  Republicans agree with this principle that I'm saying. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5208.56s)]
*  And if it's a Republican in the white house, it's the other way. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5211.6s)]
*  The Democrats agree with the principle that, uh, Congress needs to vote on it. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5215.4800000000005s)]
*  But we've got this interesting situation where there's a Republican in the white [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5220.280000000001s)]
*  house and Republicans control Congress. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5223.52s)]
*  And so it's, I don't have a single Republican co-sponsor for my bill yet for, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5226.56s)]
*  for two reasons. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5233.0s)]
*  Number one, they're afraid of APAC, the, you know, American Israel, uh, uh, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5234.360000000001s)]
*  because Israel wants that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5241.52s)]
*  Netanyahu has been wanting to fight over there forever. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5242.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5244.88s)]
*  For two decades. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5245.08s)]
*  I know there's videos of him saying like how he's been, yeah, how he's been wanting [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  to, yeah, I've seen it anyway. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5249.76s)]
*  It could be AI. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5251.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5252.12s)]
*  No, it's real for two decades. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5252.76s)]
*  He's been saying they're weeks away from a nuclear weapon. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5255.0s)]
*  Um, so do you believe that? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5258.280000000001s)]
*  By the way, even if they are Pakistan's got a nuclear weapon, India's got a nuclear [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5259.28s)]
*  weapon, nobody's talking about bombing them. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5264.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5266.5599999999995s)]
*  And the other reality is look, South Africa, people forget this used to have nuclear [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5267.5199999999995s)]
*  weapons, a country of 30 million people developed nuclear capability on their own [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5273.28s)]
*  in the seventies, like we need to be preparing to defend our own country. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5278.679999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5283.28s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck we're doing over there. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5283.96s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5285.88s)]
*  And we've almost dug so many holes over there and it's like, it just feels so [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5287.2s)]
*  far away from people. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5291.68s)]
*  Like, why is it over there starting all this shit, you know, when we have problems [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5293.12s)]
*  in our own country and their basic problems and they never get solved. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5297.08s)]
*  It's the same thing instead. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5299.88s)]
*  Like Hollywood creates like, what about the ditty trial? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5302.0s)]
*  That'll keep you entertained for fucking three months, you know, or like some, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5304.68s)]
*  here's some shit. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5308.24s)]
*  Here's a pedophile. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5309.12s)]
*  La da da da. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5310.24s)]
*  You know, it just, it's always the same fucking thing. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5311.36s)]
*  I call those weapons of mass distraction. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5313.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5315.84s)]
*  There's always a weapon of mass distraction that comes up. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5316.28s)]
*  Would you, do you think that Trump wants a war in Iran? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5319.88s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5322.72s)]
*  I actually don't. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5323.5599999999995s)]
*  And I've talked to him on the phone about this. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5324.32s)]
*  When you remember there was a Iran, a general from Iran called Soleimani who [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5327.36s)]
*  was basically taken out while he was in Iraq during the first Trump presidency. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5333.5599999999995s)]
*  Bring up Soleimani. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5339.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5340.2s)]
*  There you go. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5340.76s)]
*  Interesting looking guy. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5341.24s)]
*  He almost looks like two different people put into one head. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5342.12s)]
*  So they took him out when Trump was president. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5344.52s)]
*  Was he a good guy or bad guy? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5348.160000000001s)]
*  Bad guy. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5349.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5350.080000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5350.56s)]
*  And then, and I, I'm not here to litigate that, but Trump was talking [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5351.320000000001s)]
*  about attacking Iran after that. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5356.76s)]
*  I think they shot down one of our drones and so tensions were escalating and the [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5358.52s)]
*  Democrats put a bill on the floor to say that you can't go, basically like my [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5363.4400000000005s)]
*  bill this time, say you can't go to war without a vote of Congress. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5370.360000000001s)]
*  And I vote, I was one of three Republicans who voted for that resolution, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5374.32s)]
*  but Trump found out I was going to vote for it and he called me up and tried [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5379.12s)]
*  to talk me out of voting for it. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5382.92s)]
*  And in that conversation, we talked about war with Iran and he genuinely, I do [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5384.96s)]
*  believe he genuinely didn't want war with Iran. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5389.72s)]
*  His argument to me was that if we Congress gave him the authority to threaten them, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5392.52s)]
*  that he could keep us out of a war with the threat. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5399.64s)]
*  I see. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5402.08s)]
*  So that's a strategy. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5402.52s)]
*  It is a strategy. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5403.759999999999s)]
*  The problem with the strategy I told him was, okay, if I vote to give you that [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5405.04s)]
*  authority to declare war or on your own, you know, preemptively Congress. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5410.719999999999s)]
*  How do I know it will happen? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5416.96s)]
*  Well, what if they call your bluff? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5418.04s)]
*  And then now we're in a war and I don't get a chance to vote on it because I just [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5420.48s)]
*  said we don't need to vote on it. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5425.719999999999s)]
*  And, and, um, it was not happy with that reasoning, but. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5427.48s)]
*  Well, cause I guess, I guess his thought will be, well, if I tell you, I'm not [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5432.4400000000005s)]
*  going to do it no matter what, then why wouldn't you support me probably? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5435.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5439.52s)]
*  Um, but you can't know that he won't. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5440.52s)]
*  And by the way, he told me, he said, I'm more libertarian than you are. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5443.04s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5450.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is an interesting guy, man. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5451.2s)]
*  What are you, what an anomaly of a human being? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5453.52s)]
*  I think he is. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5455.64s)]
*  There'll never be another person like him, particularly not one that becomes [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5456.6s)]
*  president and I've been on his good side and I've been on his bad side. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5461.16s)]
*  And it seems like every couple of years it flips. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5465.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5468.0s)]
*  I saw, didn't you get uninvited to the picnic or something? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5468.12s)]
*  Was that a thing that, was that a real thing that happened? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5470.2s)]
*  That was a real thing that happened about or something that you got uninvited to the, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5472.16s)]
*  um, at the last minute I got re-invited. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5475.72s)]
*  Uh, but this goes back to 2020 during COVID. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5479.639999999999s)]
*  I was the only one who said, we're, you know, this cares act is going to bankrupt [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5482.88s)]
*  the country, basically it's going to cause massive inflation. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5488.5599999999995s)]
*  And shortages. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5491.08s)]
*  So I opposed that. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5491.76s)]
*  Um, and the president called me, he was upset with me that I would force Congress [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5493.4s)]
*  to return during COVID and vote. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5498.28s)]
*  And basically all I said was, look, this was during COVID and they wanted to spend [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5500.4s)]
*  $2 trillion by, by unanimous consent. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5505.04s)]
*  I said, if truckers have to work and farmers have to work and nurses have to work, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5508.12s)]
*  why, why doesn't Congress show up and vote on this? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5512.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5514.28s)]
*  So he, at the time he called me a third rate grandstander and said, I should be [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5515.2s)]
*  thrown out of Congress. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5518.92s)]
*  The media immediately like descended on me and said, what did I have to say for [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5521.4400000000005s)]
*  myself? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5525.76s)]
*  Cause he was tweeting all of this. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5526.24s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm at least second rate. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5527.56s)]
*  Come on. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5530.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, yeah, help me out here. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5531.24s)]
*  Two years later, he endorsed me for a reelection. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5533.04s)]
*  And then, uh, most recently Bobby Kennedy, you know, joined a coalition with the [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5537.52s)]
*  president, um, for Maha make America healthy again. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5544.04s)]
*  And you know, you can do that through the, um, national Institute of health and FDA [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5548.4s)]
*  and CDC and all that, but also our food supply is a big, important part of that. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5554.08s)]
*  So Bobby Kennedy was advocating for me to be the secretary of agriculture. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5559.28s)]
*  And he and I have been talking about it for weeks. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5564.64s)]
*  This was before Trump won the election last fall. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5567.04s)]
*  And there's a lot of agriculture out of Kentucky. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5570.76s)]
*  I would've been a great, it would have been great. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5572.2s)]
*  Something you were interested in. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5574.32s)]
*  I w yes, definitely. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5575.6s)]
*  Cause I think there are a lot of things we could do to basically reinvigorate and [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5576.96s)]
*  empower small farmers to, to make healthy food and grow local economies, things like that. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5581.52s)]
*  And so I was all in and Bobby Kennedy's team spent a lot of time on it. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5588.12s)]
*  And I told him, this was like in October before the election, I said, I think [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5592.68s)]
*  there's one problem with your plan. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5596.88s)]
*  And he said, what's that? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5598.28s)]
*  And I said, I've not endorsed Trump. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5599.72s)]
*  And he said, well, it sounds like you need to endorse Trump. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5602.08s)]
*  Do you think that was a strategy or do you think that it was? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5604.88s)]
*  No, he was genuine. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5606.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5608.04s)]
*  And I would think so. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5608.360000000001s)]
*  And I agreed with him. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5608.88s)]
*  So I said, well, how do we announce it? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5610.76s)]
*  And he said, well, come out to Wisconsin Tuesday and Tulsi and I are doing this [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5612.400000000001s)]
*  rally and just come up on stage and announce it there. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5616.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm thinking, man, I don't want to go to Wisconsin in October to do this. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5619.56s)]
*  Cause I had a lot of other things on my plate at that time. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5624.16s)]
*  And so, um, I put it off for a day. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5627.88s)]
*  I did look at plane tickets to go to Wisconsin. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5631.08s)]
*  I typed out an endorsement of Trump on my iPhone, read it back to myself. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5633.639999999999s)]
*  And I woke up the next morning and I thought, this is the day I got to do this. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5639.0s)]
*  So, uh, Trump, when my wife passed away last summer, he had left a very nice message. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5643.759999999999s)]
*  I would have obviously taken his call, but you know, there was inundated with [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5650.32s)]
*  calls, but he left a really nice message of condolences. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5653.92s)]
*  And that was thoughtful of him. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5656.92s)]
*  And so it was, and that's a side people don't see, right? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5658.24s)]
*  I actually campaigned for Ron DeSantis and Trump felt compelled to leave that [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5661.6s)]
*  message, even though I hadn't endorsed him, it was very thoughtful message. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5666.92s)]
*  So I sit down, I'm in a hotel in Orlando and I woke up and, uh, I went and I [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5671.120000000001s)]
*  listened to that message and I thought, all right, I'm going to talk to his staff [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5676.52s)]
*  about going to Wisconsin and doing this endorsement. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5680.76s)]
*  So I dialed the number and on the second ring, I hear, hello, this is Donald. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5683.68s)]
*  And it was like, oh shit, that's his cell number. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5690.400000000001s)]
*  And he's like two weeks from prison or president. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5693.08s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5696.96s)]
*  And he's taken my call to America and I was taken off guard because I thought, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5698.360000000001s)]
*  I was like, how would you do? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5703.0s)]
*  What do you freaking do? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5704.88s)]
*  Thomas sitting here in my boxers in a Marriott. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5705.8s)]
*  Oh God, at least go outside and stand up. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5708.280000000001s)]
*  You weren't sitting down, were you? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5711.08s)]
*  Cause your audio, your volume's better if you walk around where you're talking to [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5713.64s)]
*  So, uh, the first thing I did was to thank him for leaving the message. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5717.16s)]
*  About my wife. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5722.64s)]
*  I hadn't done that yet. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5724.2s)]
*  And he said, that's a hard one. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5725.96s)]
*  That's a very hard one. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5728.68s)]
*  You know, uh, Arnold Palmer, he played around a lot, but he did love his wife. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5730.24s)]
*  And when she passed away, it almost killed Arnie. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5735.28s)]
*  I mean, it was tough on Arnie, but he's a tough cookie. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5738.44s)]
*  You're a tough cookie too. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5742.48s)]
*  And, uh, you know, you're like Arnie, you'll get through this. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5744.32s)]
*  And he goes, I take it back. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5749.0s)]
*  You're much tougher than Arnie ever was. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5750.8s)]
*  So then he goes, you're sharp cookie too. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5754.12s)]
*  You know, you went to MIT. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5757.56s)]
*  My uncle, uh, professor John G. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5759.8s)]
*  Trump taught at MIT for 41 years. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5761.6s)]
*  It's a record. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5764.64s)]
*  He said, Oh, what a, what a guy. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5766.92s)]
*  What did he go? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5769.88s)]
*  I've got the best genetics. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5771.36s)]
*  I'm like, I'm thinking, wait, this guy is two weeks away and he's got to be busy. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5774.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5780.72s)]
*  This is the election of his life. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5781.04s)]
*  And so I thought, you know, at some point they're going to grab him and say, look, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5783.76s)]
*  who are you talking to? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5787.28s)]
*  You got to get back to work. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5788.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5789.24s)]
*  So I said, well, the reason I'm calling you is I want to, I've seen it's close [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5789.76s)]
*  to these purple States and a lot of independents and libertarians who could be [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5794.16s)]
*  influenced perhaps, and I'd like to endorse you. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5798.0s)]
*  Oh, this is wonderful. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5801.2s)]
*  This is great. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5802.32s)]
*  This is tremendous. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5803.12s)]
*  And I said, well, how do I, how do we get it out there? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5804.48s)]
*  And he goes, Oh, just tweet it. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5807.84s)]
*  I'll retweet you. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5809.24s)]
*  So I saved myself a trip to Wisconsin. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5811.12s)]
*  Oh, that's nice, dude. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5813.5599999999995s)]
*  I love going to Wisconsin. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5814.599999999999s)]
*  Was it in lacrosse? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5815.96s)]
*  I don't know where it was. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5817.28s)]
*  So he goes, uh, you know, I spoke at the libertarian national convention. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5818.96s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5825.8s)]
*  There's, oh yeah. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5826.44s)]
*  Um, there's a sentence in here. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5828.08s)]
*  I got to explain. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5829.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5831.16s)]
*  Uh, so he goes, I spoke at the libertarian convention and they loved me. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5832.200000000001s)]
*  He said, when I mentioned, I was going to free that kid that's been [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5837.4400000000005s)]
*  locked up a hundred years, they all applauded and Ross Albrecht. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5840.52s)]
*  So I said, Oh yeah, he's in for two life sentences plus 40 years for running a [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5846.68s)]
*  website and, um, he said, yeah, put that in your endorsement. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5850.92s)]
*  The libertarians will love it. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5856.6s)]
*  So if you look like, I'm like, he will make America healthy. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5858.92s)]
*  He'll save America's security. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5862.5599999999995s)]
*  Labor. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5864.44s)]
*  He's I said, and he'll free Ross Albrecht. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5864.64s)]
*  So a lot of people were like, we'll take it. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5868.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5869.68s)]
*  Ross's mom called me and thanked me for that. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5870.16s)]
*  And then he out. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5874.16s)]

*  I said, cool guy. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5878.5599999999995s)]
*  He's super cool guy and he never should have been in prison, uh, for as long as he was. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5879.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5885.6s)]
*  What'd he get locked up for? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5885.76s)]
*  Uh, running a dark web website called silk road that allowed people to buy and [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5886.92s)]
*  sell things on the internet. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5891.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5895.64s)]
*  So, uh, so that's what he's holding for a year, but I mean, that's the thing. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5896.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5901.64s)]
*  It's like, you can't lock him up. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5901.8s)]
*  If you can't lock him up and not lock up, all the perpetrators on the website are [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5902.88s)]

*  He said, we're going to go tape to Joe Rogan show. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5947.64s)]
*  Then he like, I can hear him hand the phone. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5951.12s)]
*  Oh, that was right before the election, dude. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5952.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5954.84s)]
*  He hands the phone to Skavino and he's like, I don't think he knew I could [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5955.6s)]
*  hear him because then this is a tough cookie. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5959.72s)]
*  It's Thomas messy. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5962.2s)]
*  Uh, don't screw this up. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5963.64s)]
*  Then we worked out the endorsement and it's pretty cool. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5966.28s)]
*  Huh? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5968.56s)]
*  It was cool. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5969.04s)]
*  Cause then instead of like a bunch of staff trying to figure out what to do, I [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5969.72s)]
*  just called him. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5973.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5974.36s)]
*  And we got it done in like five minutes. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5974.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5976.64s)]
*  But, and I did endorse him and then I'm obviously I'm not the ag secretary, but [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5977.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm that's okay. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5982.360000000001s)]
*  I'm happy where I'm at. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5983.4400000000005s)]
*  I would have done it if he needed somebody to do it. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5985.0s)]
*  But are you guys at odds? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5987.56s)]
*  Do you feel like, or do you feel like there's so much going on in his world? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5988.72s)]
*  Well, he came over to Congress a few weeks ago to whip us on the big, beautiful bill. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=5992.92s)]
*  And so when that happens, you guys all get together in a room and he gets to speak. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6000.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6003.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6003.88s)]
*  200 people in the room. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6004.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6005.4s)]
*  And so he's petitioning for the big, beautiful bill. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6005.72s)]
*  He's telling us how great it is. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6008.16s)]
*  And then he's, she says something about me and then he realizes I might be in the [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6010.24s)]
*  room. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6014.88s)]
*  He said, is Tom Massey in the room? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6015.8s)]
*  And I raised my hand and he said, you know, the thing about Tom Massey is, um, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6018.24s)]
*  he's very much like Rand Paul. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6024.96s)]
*  They're both from Kentucky. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6026.96s)]
*  You can never get him to vote for anything. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6028.5199999999995s)]
*  And they got the same hair. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6030.8s)]
*  That's pretty true. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6032.92s)]
*  And then he goes, actually, I like Massey's hair better. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6034.12s)]
*  So all my colleagues, they, they were approving of me that day. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6037.6s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6042.8s)]
*  So there's some, I mean, people, people, some people hate Donald Trump. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6044.28s)]
*  Some people love Donald Trump. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6047.92s)]
*  I just think you cannot deny that he is a, they, there is nobody like him. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6049.2s)]
*  There's two, there's two forms of Trump derangement syndrome though. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6055.4800000000005s)]
*  There's, uh, there's the kind where you hate him so much, it's irrational. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6059.4s)]
*  And even if he's for something you support, you still be against him. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6065.639999999999s)]
*  And, and a lot of liberals have Trump derangement syndrome and some Republicans. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6069.36s)]
*  Well, that's a general thing. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6073.44s)]
*  I think that's just a political derangement syndrome too. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I have friends, it's like, you could show them the same exact thing, but [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6077.08s)]
*  if it's a Republican saying it or a Democrat and they'll choose the other side, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6080.5599999999995s)]
*  you know? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6084.0s)]
*  Well, that's why there's the other version of Trump derangement syndrome, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6084.44s)]
*  which is you love him so much that when he goes against something he said he would [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6087.68s)]
*  do, or he does something that's against your principles, you change your own [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6093.08s)]
*  principles to support him. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6097.200000000001s)]
*  And I think that's just as dangerous. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6099.4400000000005s)]
*  And I try not to have either of the Trump derangements in, just be for the people of [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6102.320000000001s)]
*  Kentucky. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6109.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6109.88s)]
*  Look, Kentucky derangement alone is, that's a pretty good, you know what I'm saying? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6110.360000000001s)]
*  That's not a bad, you know, that's, that's [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6115.68s)]
*  a, I mean, that's its own special 150 proof derangement right there. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6117.68s)]
*  You know, it's one of a kind. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6122.360000000001s)]
*  I'm a man of my people. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6123.88s)]
*  It's one of a kind. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6127.240000000001s)]
*  You know, what's one of the most beautiful place I've ever done a show was Pike. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6128.240000000001s)]
*  Pikeville. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6132.0s)]
*  Pikeville, Kentucky. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6132.68s)]
*  Yep. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6133.64s)]
*  Eastern Kentucky. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6133.96s)]
*  It was a tough show. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6134.84s)]
*  It was just, I don't know if it was the acoustics place we played, but it was a [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6135.84s)]
*  beautiful little city, great crowd. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6138.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, beautiful big town. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6141.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the most beautiful place I think I've ever been. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6142.64s)]
*  It just blew my mind of what it even was. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6144.4400000000005s)]
*  See, see if you can find a picture of Lewis County, Kentucky. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6146.88s)]
*  That's where I'm from. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6149.639999999999s)]
*  It's a, that's the town I grew up in right there. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6150.92s)]
*  What is that? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6154.08s)]
*  I believe that's Vanceburg. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6154.679999999999s)]
*  That's Vanceburg. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6157.2s)]
*  Yep. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6158.04s)]
*  And the courthouse with the red roof on the left, uh, with the columns. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6158.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6162.8s)]
*  The there's two courthouses, but one on the left, my grandfather hauled the [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6163.24s)]
*  stones for that courthouse that were quarried locally. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6166.5599999999995s)]
*  Dude, that is cool. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6169.88s)]
*  How big is that place? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6170.76s)]
*  It's about, uh, 2000 people. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6171.96s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6174.16s)]
*  And it's the County seat. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6175.2s)]
*  It's the biggest town in the County. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6176.92s)]
*  So you go there to buy beer and to go to church and put your money in the bank [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6179.2s)]
*  or get a loan in Lewis County. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6185.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6188.16s)]

*  Uh, the whole County is, uh, about 13 or 14,000 people and Vanceburg used to be [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6191.4s)]
*  2000, it's probably 1500 people now, but that's where I grew up. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6198.8s)]
*  And I, this is a true story. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6203.4s)]
*  When I went to MIT, which is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, across the river from [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6205.08s)]
*  Boston, you can see in Vanceburg, there's no crosswalks, we had one stoplight. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6209.12s)]
*  And I lived there until I was 18. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6214.76s)]
*  Then I would go to Massachusetts, never visited in my life. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6217.8s)]
*  And I landed on a plane. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6221.88s)]
*  I'm going through a crosswalk, you know, with the signs that say walk and don't walk. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6224.0s)]
*  And a car honked at me and I thought, Oh my gosh, I'd been here six hours and [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6228.48s)]
*  already run into somebody from Kentucky. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6232.76s)]
*  And I waved at them. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6234.56s)]
*  Cause I thought the car honking knew me. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6236.04s)]
*  No, they were pissed. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6238.52s)]
*  They were waving back with one finger because I was walking [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6239.96s)]
*  against a don't walk or something. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6243.12s)]
*  Get out the street honking. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6244.400000000001s)]
*  That's hilarious, dude. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6246.8s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6248.72s)]
*  Going from a small town to a big place is definitely fascinating, man. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6249.24s)]
*  It's definitely. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6253.280000000001s)]
*  That was, and it was intimidating, like to go from that little town where [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6254.6s)]
*  everybody says, Oh, you're uneducated. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6259.32s)]

*  I went to public school K through 12 there. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6266.04s)]
*  And then, and then to go to MIT with all these kids from private school and [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6268.5599999999995s)]

*  basically my ticket out of Appalachia. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6283.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6285.92s)]
*  And went to MIT and started a company there. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6286.4800000000005s)]
*  It was actually a virtual reality interface that I intended that lets you touch [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6290.68s)]
*  three dimensional objects and raise $32 million of venture capital. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6294.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6300.28s)]
*  From people like JD Vance. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6301.28s)]
*  Have you seen, well, and some of your story remind or is similar to Mr. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6304.8s)]
*  Vance's I think in some ways, you know, it's like, and you don't hear a lot of [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6308.400000000001s)]
*  stories about like, I mean, I think that they happen, but you don't hear that [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6311.84s)]
*  many of them, you know, and maybe it's just cause we don't talk to as many [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6315.36s)]
*  politicians that are like, usually politicians were always like on C span or [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6318.28s)]
*  somewhere where you didn't really get to envelop much of their story. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6321.88s)]
*  I think by JD having that movie that came out about him probably helped. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6325.16s)]
*  Um, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6329.4s)]
*  well, the book, I mean, he wrote the book and it rings true for me. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6330.04s)]
*  Like he, he went to new England to school. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6334.28s)]
*  I went to new England from school. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6336.36s)]
*  I didn't know where the place, what to do with the place setting of, of, of [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6338.48s)]
*  silverware. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6342.5199999999995s)]
*  I was waving at cars that honked, but I tell JD when he was a senator, we, we [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6343.799999999999s)]
*  met a few times to talk about the Ukraine issue and things like that. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6348.799999999999s)]
*  Uh, but I told him, I said, JD, you've appropriated my culture. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6353.5199999999995s)]
*  Like I'm from Vance, Kentucky, literally Vance Berg, and you're from Ohio. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6356.92s)]
*  And you're saying you're a hillbilly. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6362.28s)]
*  Like he's part of the, the hillbilly people that like my people that left [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6364.0s)]
*  and went to Ohio. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6369.879999999999s)]
*  So I, I have a brother and a sister. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6370.719999999999s)]
*  They both went to Ohio. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6372.96s)]
*  We, it was a big migration. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6374.64s)]
*  Why was it? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6376.36s)]
*  Was it to work in the mills? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6376.8s)]
*  It was, uh, there were shoe factories. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6378.76s)]
*  Some of them went to Detroit to work at car factories for employment, employment. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6381.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6385.6s)]
*  Uh, and, and this continued for generations as coal went down, but then we said they [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6386.04s)]
*  teach you three Rs in Eastern Kentucky, reading, writing, and route 23. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6391.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6396.56s)]
*  23 runs North, crosses the river and goes up from Portsmouth to Columbus and on up [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6397.36s)]
*  that way. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6403.84s)]
*  So, um, the difference between JD and I is my mamal didn't drop F bombs. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6404.84s)]
*  Like he had, uh, I will say he probably had a rougher upbringing with, you know, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6411.08s)]
*  his single mom and whatnot. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6415.44s)]
*  So he had overcome a lot. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6417.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6418.96s)]
*  I mean, he's an, I mean, I think JD's a great speaker. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6419.12s)]
*  He's an interesting guy, you know, I've enjoyed the opportunity to even get [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6421.44s)]
*  to talk to him. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6425.2s)]
*  The simple fact that even somebody like me is even going to talk to him. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6425.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it's all kind of fascinating. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6427.96s)]
*  I think it's great. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6429.48s)]
*  I think he's over there biting his tongue so much though, like, cause when you're [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6430.36s)]
*  the vice president. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6433.92s)]
*  Oh, it did feel different when I spoke with him the first time than the second [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6435.24s)]
*  time you, you, and he's a good guy. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6438.0s)]
*  Like he's texted me since he's been vice president and, um, he's a good guy, but [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6440.16s)]
*  I'm sure he's biting his tongue on some of this stuff. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6447.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6450.2s)]
*  I bet it's interesting. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6450.36s)]
*  You know, I bet the plot thickens, you know, I bet the plot really, really [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6451.28s)]
*  thickens. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6454.36s)]
*  Um, you talked about working in virtual reality. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6455.08s)]
*  How crazy I feel like now, did you see Iran did that? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6457.2s)]
*  Uh, there was a military video that they had pushing their military. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6460.32s)]
*  It was like, um, and we'll be done in a few minutes. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6464.04s)]
*  Um, see if you can bring that up. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6467.0s)]
*  It was, uh, yeah. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6468.2s)]
*  Did you see now it's like, there's like PR videos for war and shit now. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6468.839999999999s)]
*  Like what is even look at this shit. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6473.16s)]
*  So man, this is like a video game. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6475.44s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6497.04s)]
*  It's just getting really bizarre. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6497.88s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6511.32s)]
*  I mean, that's good, but I think it's like, well, it's like we're it's like now. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6511.76s)]
*  And I feel like we're getting so close to, you're going to be able to subscribe [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6515.64s)]
*  online and stream, watch a stream of a war. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6520.08s)]
*  Like you're going to be able to have drones that are in the air watching [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6523.68s)]
*  war, right? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6527.76s)]
*  Like probably Palantir drones or some company in the air. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6528.88s)]
*  And you can stream it from home. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6532.04s)]
*  But wouldn't it be better if just like the drones killed the other drones and [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6534.280000000001s)]
*  people didn't get killed. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6537.96s)]
*  And maybe that's it's virtual reality and who can ever, who can build the [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6539.0s)]
*  best army in VR that'd be a lot better way than killing people. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6543.04s)]
*  I agree. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6547.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's gotten, I mean, it's like, you're going to be able to, you know, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6548.200000000001s)]
*  it's going to be like, yeah, shit is just like you said earlier, everything [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6551.52s)]
*  is feels merging. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6555.4400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't even feel real anymore. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6556.360000000001s)]
*  That's how unreal shit is. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6557.88s)]
*  It doesn't even, you can barely tell as a regular semi ignorant person, the [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6560.52s)]
*  difference between what's real and what's not anymore. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6566.120000000001s)]
*  And that's when things get bizarre. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6569.120000000001s)]
*  It's like, I feel like next week, like I show speed is going to like compete [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6570.56s)]
*  against Netanyahu son or whatever that lives, I think in LA or somewhere like, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6574.76s)]
*  but, and they're going to compete and like the winner gets to, um, live in like [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6578.8s)]
*  a, one of those like Congo cobalt mines where they're making iPhone like parts. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6582.76s)]
*  It just, you're just like, what the fuck is happening anymore? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6587.56s)]
*  It happens on both sides though. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6590.360000000001s)]
*  And truth is the first casualty of war. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6591.92s)]
*  And you saw like, there was the ghost of Kiev. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6594.56s)]
*  Remember when that came out and then there was supposedly this aviator in Ukraine [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6596.76s)]
*  that was shooting down all these Russian jets. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6602.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6605.0s)]
*  It was lore. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6605.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6606.68s)]
*  It was, it was all. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6607.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6608.280000000001s)]
*  It was all made up. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6608.68s)]
*  It was popular, but ultimately mythical Ukrainian fighter pilot, an urban legend [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6609.8s)]
*  that emerged during the early days of the Russian invasion, Ukraine in 2022. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6614.88s)]
*  He said that a single MIG 29 pilot was shooting down multiple Russian [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6617.8s)]
*  aircraft, becoming a similar resistance. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6621.240000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6622.76s)]
*  So, and, and that was being reported as a real thing and congressmen were falling [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6623.280000000001s)]
*  for that. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6628.8s)]
*  And so I have tried to be very judicious in all the videos I watch of everything [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6629.360000000001s)]
*  that's coming from all the countries, whether it's Iran or Israel or our own. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6635.12s)]
*  And I actually caught the IDF, this is Israeli defense forces, putting, using a [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6640.08s)]
*  clip that was from last year, trying to make it look like that was Israel being [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6646.28s)]
*  bombed this week. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6652.5599999999995s)]
*  And I, this is one of the fun things about being a congressman with 1.3 million [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6655.04s)]
*  followers. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6661.12s)]
*  Like I pointed it out and people started looking at it and comparing it to the video [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6661.8s)]
*  from nine months ago. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6666.68s)]
*  And they got community noted the IDF for putting out a fake video. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6668.56s)]
*  They didn't have to. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6673.56s)]
*  I mean, there's plenty of live footage, but they fell for it. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6674.400000000001s)]
*  Like we're just, we're in a loop. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6678.4400000000005s)]
*  We're, we're consuming stuff on the internet and you know, the loop has been [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6680.52s)]
*  completed when the Israeli government consumes YouTube's that aren't real and [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6684.84s)]
*  then puts them in their videos. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6691.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6693.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6694.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, I could see them doing it just because, but yeah, I think it's definitely [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6695.599999999999s)]
*  the loop is like we're spinning the loop so long. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6699.5199999999995s)]
*  We're dizzy. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6701.8s)]
*  That's where, that's where it feels if you can step out of it. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6702.599999999999s)]
*  Like I haven't had a TV in 20 years because, um, you're not missing anything. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6705.36s)]
*  It just reinforces the false. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6711.4s)]
*  There we go. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6713.5599999999995s)]
*  Breaking bad was good today. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6714.48s)]
*  And, oh yeah, who knows? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6716.04s)]
*  See, you can't tell what's really more. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6718.68s)]
*  Raw footage, Iran. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6720.84s)]
*  There, there, yeah. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6722.0s)]
*  There's the two videos. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6722.8s)]
*  Look, that's, that's the one they put out that said was happening in the past hours. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6723.88s)]
*  Right? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6728.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6729.04s)]
*  Now look at the other one. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6729.320000000001s)]
*  The clouds are the same shape. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6730.76s)]
*  The missiles are in the same formation. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6732.4400000000005s)]
*  And that was a YouTube from eight months ago. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6734.52s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6736.4800000000005s)]
*  But the, the reason I caught it and nobody else did was I was trying to verify [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6737.400000000001s)]
*  everything before I took it as real. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6742.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6745.52s)]
*  And I saw that video from eight months ago and figured out it was fake. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6745.92s)]
*  But the IDF didn't, or maybe they did. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6749.92s)]
*  And it just was more dramatic than the footage they had. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6752.68s)]
*  That could be more of that sounds slightly more possible, but what do I know? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6755.24s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6759.16s)]
*  I know this dude. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6760.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, what can we do? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6761.64s)]
*  I'll like, what can voters do anymore? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6763.2s)]
*  Do we, does it matter anymore? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6764.84s)]
*  What we do or are we done? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6766.4400000000005s)]
*  It does matter. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6768.32s)]
*  Um, you're going to, does local level matter more than ever local level [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6769.6s)]
*  voting or what matters? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6774.56s)]
*  Like, what do we, what do we, what can we do? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6775.56s)]
*  So the Congressman before me in my district got a call at home one night and this [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6778.84s)]
*  older lady was upset that her trash hadn't been picked up and he's a US Congressman. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6785.200000000001s)]
*  He said, ma'am, he said, no, he said, I'm your US Congressman. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6790.04s)]
*  I don't, I'm not involved with the trash pickup. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6794.04s)]
*  Did you think about calling your County commissioner? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6796.200000000001s)]
*  And she said, I was going to do that, but I didn't want to start that high up. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6798.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6802.0s)]
*  So, um, it, I think local is, I started out in local politics and, and the local [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6802.48s)]
*  officials have way more impact on your life than the, than the federal government does. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6808.679999999999s)]
*  And so I would take time and pay attention and vote locally. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6813.639999999999s)]
*  And those are also people you can go find. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6818.2s)]
*  When I was a local government official and we would stop at the grocery store to buy [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6820.28s)]
*  milk, my kids would beg my wife to go in to pick up the trash. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6825.16s)]
*  Because I'd be in there two hours and somebody talked to me about a pothole and [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6829.92s)]
*  somebody talked to me about some weeds that need mode at the intersection. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6833.5199999999995s)]
*  And I wouldn't get out of there. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6837.28s)]
*  Now that I'm a Congressman, I can buy milk anywhere. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6839.04s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6841.4s)]
*  They know Congress can't get anything done. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6842.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6844.5599999999995s)]
*  And so I think the people have figured it out. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6845.6s)]
*  Definitely pay attention local. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6848.28s)]
*  When you do pay attention federal, don't get distracted by the weapons of mass [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6850.76s)]
*  distraction. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6855.839999999999s)]
*  Don't call Nancy Pelosi. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6856.839999999999s)]
*  She's not, you're not going to change her mind. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6859.759999999999s)]
*  Only call people you can vote for because the people taking those calls know that [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6862.44s)]
*  and they'll discount everything you say unless you're a constituent. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6866.88s)]
*  So everybody has two state senators and one U S representative. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6869.96s)]
*  So you only need to make three phone calls. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6874.08s)]
*  I wouldn't write them a letter. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6876.12s)]
*  I wouldn't waste time on email. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6877.36s)]
*  I would make a phone call and a real more, more, more, more, more, more, more [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6879.28s)]
*  people would make a phone call and a real more likely than not, a real person in [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6883.48s)]
*  that office will pick up the phone and talk to you. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6886.96s)]
*  And it'll be somebody who does talk to the congressman. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6889.48s)]
*  Like we, we have a staff of about 12 to 24 people. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6892.12s)]
*  And I say hi to those people that you are talking to every day. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6896.44s)]
*  Now, I don't know that all congressmen are this diligent, but I have them write [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6900.639999999999s)]
*  down who called about what and how many calls we got. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6905.12s)]
*  Some days I get one phone call and it's from the same guy that calls every day. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6908.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6912.48s)]
*  Michael, if Michael doesn't call, we ask the local sheriff to go do a wellness check. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6912.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6917.68s)]
*  Don't, don't be a frequent flyer. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6918.320000000001s)]
*  Don't call up your congressman and say, I'll never vote for him again if he votes [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6920.400000000001s)]
*  this way, because then they never have to take you seriously, but I would call up. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6924.360000000001s)]
*  I would only call people you can vote for and be polite, be quick, get off the phone. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6929.0s)]
*  The next one, your people, I see people come up to lobby, let's say for their, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6934.16s)]
*  for their grandma who has Alzheimer's and they spend $300 on a plane ticket, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6941.48s)]
*  a couple hundred dollars on a hotel room. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6948.2s)]
*  Uh, they, you know, the food is expensive in DC and they finally get to their [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6951.04s)]
*  congressman's office and they talk to a staffer. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6957.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6959.36s)]
*  That to me is a waste of money. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6960.32s)]
*  I would, uh, find that congressman locally and take half of what you would [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6963.2s)]
*  spend on the trip to DC. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6968.72s)]
*  And if you could stomach that person's politics, make a donation. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6970.52s)]
*  That's why the lobbyist has the ear. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6975.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not saying America has to compete with lobbyists for giving money, but I [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6977.52s)]
*  will tell you this, if you give a politician $500, you won't have to ask [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6981.04s)]
*  for his phone number, he'll be calling you every week asking for more of it. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6986.08s)]
*  And so, so, but that's where we're at. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6992.72s)]
*  That's where we're at. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6995.320000000001s)]
*  Cause we just have to compete. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6996.48s)]
*  Money has to compete with money. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6997.5199999999995s)]
*  You think dark money? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=6998.719999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have to compete, but you got to figure out a way to get their attention. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7000.4s)]
*  You know, if it's whatever the minimum is to get in the door that, oh yeah. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7004.48s)]
*  Fund rate, if it's $50, don't give them 500, give them 50 and go in and, um, just [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7008.5199999999995s)]
*  talk to them like a human being if you can. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7015.5599999999995s)]
*  But at a bigger level, like will we ever get, will the people, you know, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7018.679999999999s)]
*  will we ever get these lobbyists out? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7022.5199999999995s)]
*  Is it just a rap? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7024.08s)]
*  What are we? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7024.919999999999s)]
*  Tell us if we all just. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7026.32s)]
*  Here's the way, here's the way you break free. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7027.759999999999s)]
*  No, well, you should definitely go to the beach and only spend about no more than [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7029.88s)]
*  10% of your life thinking about politics because it ain't healthy. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7033.799999999999s)]
*  Amen. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7037.24s)]
*  And, um, but the 10% that you do, you should, you should ask your [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7038.24s)]
*  congressman to advocate for separate bills on separate topics. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7044.4s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7048.0s)]
*  That seems way more pertinent because then you get, there's some, a level of accountability. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7048.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7052.16s)]
*  And they can't hide behind, well, it had a pay raise for soldiers. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7052.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7055.48s)]
*  Um, um, so advocate for that, uh, make phone calls if you can be friendly and [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7056.2s)]
*  connect with them, maybe you don't agree with them on everything, but a broken [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7063.0s)]
*  clock is right twice a day. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7066.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7068.92s)]
*  Some diplomacy. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7069.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7070.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7071.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7071.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's a big thing I've been learning recently is that there's a [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7071.759999999999s)]
*  give and take to everything, every single, everything, you know, and that's [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7074.5199999999995s)]
*  the way that the world's built. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7077.5599999999995s)]
*  There's like, you know, there's forces as a give and take, there's a yin and yang. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7078.48s)]
*  And even when you have, you want this party or this thing, it's like, there [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7081.76s)]
*  has to be like, uh, um, you really need both forces a lot of times to get things [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7085.6s)]
*  done. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7091.240000000001s)]
*  Um, I think that's about it, man. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7091.88s)]
*  I'm trying to think of anything else. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7095.04s)]
*  Oh, I did want to say we were going to supposed to talk to Mr. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7096.76s)]
*  Walls this week, Tim Walls, uh, on Thursday, cause I have a show up there, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7098.92s)]
*  but he can't, he is unable to go cause of they're doing services and stuff for [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7103.76s)]
*  that. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7109.28s)]
*  His constituents or his colleagues, maybe that were murdered up there. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7110.2s)]
*  I, you know, it's pretty heartbreaking. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7115.679999999999s)]
*  It is heartbreaking. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7117.5199999999995s)]
*  And he seems like a guy with a big heart too. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7118.4s)]
*  I get death threats. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7120.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, I, and the hard part is knowing which ones to take seriously and [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7122.0s)]
*  which one's not, I mean, it's definitely not the right way to do politics. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7126.4s)]
*  Um, it's just, there's no, there's no level of frustration that justifies [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7131.0s)]
*  violence. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7137.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7138.48s)]
*  I mean, that just seems really bizarre. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7138.96s)]
*  Um, there was, I remember there was rumors that whenever your wife passed [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7140.96s)]
*  away, that there was like something bad had happened, like from a, like a, like [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7144.52s)]
*  a, not a deranged person or something like that. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7149.2s)]
*  Was that real? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7151.12s)]
*  No, she died unexpectedly, but of natural causes. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7151.72s)]
*  And, um, I wasn't home. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7155.4800000000005s)]
*  I was in DC, which kills me to this day. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7157.16s)]
*  Um, but my son was home visiting, so we know exactly what happened. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7160.52s)]
*  There's no conspiracy there. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7166.0s)]
*  Although, uh, sorry to even ask you about it. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7167.88s)]
*  Well, no, I think it's good. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7169.8s)]
*  Cause people ask that people want to know that I tell people she would, uh, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7171.0s)]
*  get a kick out of it. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7176.96s)]
*  She would. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7178.52s)]
*  Everybody wants to be a part of, yeah. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7179.04s)]
*  Like anyway, that's it. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7180.84s)]
*  There was a conspiracy, but, um, I'm sure she's, she's up there laughing at that one. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7182.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I know it's coming up on a year since she's been gone. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7187.68s)]
*  And, uh, yeah, just sorry to kind of, maybe that was a little out of the box to say [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7190.68s)]
*  that, but, um, yeah, I'm sorry. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7195.04s)]
*  You and your family had to go through that. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7197.56s)]
*  So I appreciate you being brave and still being able to, um, honor your [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7199.72s)]
*  constituents and your, uh, group, even in the face of those types of things and, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7203.8s)]
*  and still be able to show up and, and, uh, do your best and, and be a maverick, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7208.200000000001s)]
*  I think for probably for her spirit and for the people of, um, of our country. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7212.72s)]
*  You know, I think that's one thing it's inspiring. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7216.72s)]
*  Some people were like, well, this guy's nuts or this guy's great. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7218.04s)]
*  But I'm like, at least this guy's his own fucking guy. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7220.8s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7223.400000000001s)]
*  Like I'd rather talk to that guy any day of the week. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7224.160000000001s)]
*  Well, the other conspiracy that's interesting to me is, uh, people say, oh, [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7227.0s)]
*  he snapped like he's lost his marbles since he lost his wife and, um, he's off [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7231.4400000000005s)]
*  the chain, et cetera, et cetera. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7237.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I'm actually honoring what she wanted. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7239.04s)]
*  Like she worked at home on our farm and raised four kids. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7242.04s)]
*  She also had an MIT degree and she was watching me from afar every day. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7245.52s)]
*  She would watch hearings and give me advice for questions to ask. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7251.4800000000005s)]
*  And she wanted me to go up there and kick ass every week. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7255.400000000001s)]
*  And, and that's what I do. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7260.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm still going to do it. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7262.240000000001s)]
*  I remember one time, uh, I introduced a bill to legalize raw milk, like the kind [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7263.72s)]
*  I got out there in my camper truck. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7269.08s)]
*  I'll take another swig off that thing. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7271.04s)]
*  As long as you leave the door open while we do it. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7272.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7273.88s)]
*  We had alarms going off in there. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7274.8s)]
*  The gaydar in my camper was going off when you went in there. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7276.56s)]
*  Two men got in that thing and suddenly an alarm went off. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7279.12s)]
*  I was like, this is a little too Republican for me. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7281.88s)]
*  It's a little too old school Republican for me. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7284.92s)]
*  If two men can't even casually drink raw milk together in the back of a truck [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7287.320000000001s)]
*  camper. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7292.2s)]
*  I know. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7292.64s)]
*  I, so I introduced a raw milk bill to legalize raw milk and, oh yeah, there we go. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7293.320000000001s)]
*  And it's an honor of her kind of, well, this was, she was still alive and I [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7298.76s)]
*  introduced this bill and the guess who came after me? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7303.0s)]
*  The, uh, the milk lobbyists came after me. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7306.52s)]
*  They said there wouldn't be enough hospitals to take care of all the people [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7310.04s)]
*  who got sick from raw milk, who were going to get sick from raw milk. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7314.68s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7317.0s)]
*  Do you think? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7317.24s)]
*  Oh, hell no. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7317.8s)]
*  I drink it every day. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7318.92s)]
*  I know thousands of people that drink it every day. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7320.28s)]
*  I'm going to catch a fucking batch of it. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7323.72s)]
*  It always looks like it's a little warm. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7325.24s)]
*  No, I pour mine in a ice cold glass, but anyways, uh, and it tastes like just liquid [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7328.04s)]
*  ice cream. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7335.4s)]
*  Oh, it's so good. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7336.04s)]
*  I'll come have a little bit more. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7337.48s)]
*  All right. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7338.76s)]
*  Well, so I did this bill and the milk lobby comes after me and my wife had Google [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7339.4s)]
*  alerts on or whatever alerts there were. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7345.639999999999s)]
*  And it's like all this negative press over milk. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7348.2s)]
*  And she texted me, OMG, I didn't realize the lactose lobby was this intolerant. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7351.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I think even just the name of, um, the lactose lobby was this intolerant. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7358.04s)]
*  That's cute. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7365.48s)]
*  What was her name? [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7366.2s)]
*  Your wife? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7367.08s)]
*  Rhonda. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7367.5599999999995s)]
*  Rhonda. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7368.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7368.679999999999s)]
*  Um, well, we miss you Rhonda. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7369.4s)]
*  Just a nice thought of you there and a nice story. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7371.32s)]
*  I love the fact that that's called the interstate milk freedom act, which sounds insane, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7373.32s)]
*  dude. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7378.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7379.08s)]
*  It sounds like something that happens at a rest area. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7379.639999999999s)]
*  You know, that's the problem with it. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7381.799999999999s)]
*  I think it's easier to get meth than it is to get raw milk. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7383.4s)]
*  I'm not lying. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7387.96s)]
*  And at least put birth control in the meth. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7389.88s)]
*  When do we make that law? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26s5N2Y_IZg&t=7392.04s)]
