Video Description: Nick Kyrgios is a professional tennis player and commentator based in Australia. He was a 2022 Wimbledon Finalist and one of the only players to beat the big 3 of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at least once. He also hosts his own podcast, “Good Trouble with Nick Kyrgios” which is available on all platforms. 

Nick Kyrgios joins Theo to chat about his reputation for being “the bad boy of Tennis”, how it felt beating some of sport’s biggest icons, why he thinks he played some of his best tennis after going to the pub, his now-viral heated exchange with Ben Stiller, ideas for evolving the game, and more.

*  What's it been like for you recently? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=140.16s)]
*  I know you kind of have had like a little bit of a break from playing tennis, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=141.64s)]
*  Yeah, I've had two surgeries now in the last year. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=145.56s)]

*  Finals of Wimbledon. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=156.04s)]
*  It was love and life and then a couple injuries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=157.04s)]
*  But it's good, man. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=159.24s)]
*  I like being back in Australia because if I'm healthy, I'm traveling like eight months [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=160.24s)]
*  a year away from family and friends. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=163.88s)]
*  Just for tennis, it takes that much of commitment? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=166.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's tournaments every week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=168.48s)]
*  You play every week in different places, different countries. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=170.72s)]
*  I'm pretty happy, like not to be injured, but to spend some time with the families. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=174.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=178.72s)]
*  Is it dangerous? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=179.72s)]
*  Like, I would be scared because comfort gets kind of dangerous, you know? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=180.72s)]
*  Like you're comfortable or you have just even just getting to go to the like the things [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=186.28s)]
*  I miss when I'm away from home, it's even just getting to go to the gym with my mates, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  like little things like that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  It's like that would keep me from going and doing some dates sometimes, some shows. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=195.68s)]
*  Like, I just want to have this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=200.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=203.08s)]
*  Does that kind of shit start to like worry your brain at all? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=204.08s)]
*  Like, yeah, well, that's what I was missing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=207.84s)]
*  That like for 10 years I was traveling week in, week out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=210.56s)]
*  I missed just waking up in my own bed, like spending time with my dogs or my friends, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=213.4s)]
*  like going to the cafe. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=217.4s)]
*  And I guess I'm getting that now, which is good. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=219.08s)]
*  Like I'm definitely spending more time in Australia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=220.96s)]
*  I'm busy though. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=222.44s)]
*  Like, you know how it is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=223.44s)]
*  Even when you're back home, you're trying to have meetings or be busy and stuff. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=224.44s)]
*  Yeah, look, I don't mind just being from Canberra and chilling in Sydney a little bit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=228.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=231.96s)]
*  In tennis, because I don't know a ton about tennis. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=232.96s)]
*  I used to live with some people and they played it a lot. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=234.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=236.68s)]
*  They had a little bit of money. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=237.68s)]
*  They would drink wine and like eat like a lot of charcuterie and stuff. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=238.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=242.28s)]
*  But they would do tennis during the daytime, you know, and the skirts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=243.28s)]
*  I like the skirts on the women. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=247.64s)]
*  And but outside of that, I never knew a ton about it, you know. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=248.84s)]
*  Is it like, because you've gotten to be at a level in it that's really impressive, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=253.68s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=258.92s)]
*  When you get to certain levels, you get to see what the next shelf is like or what that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=259.92s)]
*  you know, you get a better look at certain things, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=264.44s)]
*  Do you see that there's like a thing that makes some people get to an elite level? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=267.24s)]
*  Like is it extra training? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=272.16s)]
*  Is it commitment? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=274.56s)]
*  Is it just nature? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=276.02s)]
*  Like, is it just that some people just have it? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, I'm just curious about like what it's what can you see once you get to your level [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=280.56s)]
*  that that separates the elites? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=285.72s)]
*  And I'm not saying you're not an elite player. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=291.24s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=292.72s)]
*  Do you understand what I'm saying? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=293.72s)]
*  I was about to just go where you're going is like I'm probably really like I'm really [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=294.72s)]
*  good. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=298.76s)]
*  I'm elite. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=299.76s)]
*  But then what separates me from someone say like Novak Djokovic or, you know, Rafa, like [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=300.76s)]
*  the greatest of all time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=304.32s)]
*  Like for me, I was partying a lot when I was playing like I would play and go to the pub [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=305.6s)]
*  and I wouldn't I don't regret it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=310.4s)]
*  Like I love the fact that like my agents on my team had to drag me out of places at like [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=311.76s)]
*  4 a.m. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=315.84s)]
*  Like I love that shit. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=316.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=317.84s)]
*  But at the same time, like that was what separated me, I guess, from them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=318.84s)]
*  Like they were so diligent, so consistent. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=321.8s)]
*  Like now I'm a lot better. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=323.6s)]
*  But obviously when I was a bit younger, but the consistency that they've shown over decades [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=325.08s)]
*  is why like they're having way more success than I have. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=330.5s)]
*  Is some of it nature? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=333.36s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=334.6s)]
*  Do you guys just have a different element, like a different gear that God gave them? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=335.72s)]
*  Or do you think that it's like a commitment thing? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=340.36s)]
*  Because I'm just curious, because tennis is such a solo sport. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=343.72s)]
*  It's like golf. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=347.24s)]
*  It's like I mean, there's there's no team, really. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=348.24s)]
*  It's just fucking you out there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=352.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I played my longest matches, four hours and 52 minutes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  And I was having some serious. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  That's like watching Oppenheimer, but having to play the whole time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's you have some mental serious, some serious mental conversations with yourself. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=362.48s)]
*  But I mean, yeah, like and then you have like you go do that again for seven days straight [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=367.2s)]
*  to win a tournament, basically. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=373.32s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=374.32s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=375.32s)]
*  That's like a grand slam. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=376.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's like how hard it is mentally. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=377.32s)]
*  I mean, but the consistency, like, for instance, my nature, I wasn't willing to give up like [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=379.28s)]
*  the fun aspect of things whilst I was playing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=385.12s)]
*  Where like if I did that, definitely I probably would have had more success. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=387.76s)]
*  I've had so much fun in my career. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=390.8s)]
*  Like, those are the memories. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=392.28s)]
*  I'm sure you can't talk about them here, but like those are the memories you take to the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=393.36s)]
*  grave. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  And oh, yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  And then that's like I wouldn't trade that for a grand slam. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=400.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=401.4s)]
*  But that's the trade off. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=402.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=403.4s)]
*  You're kind of like John Daly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=404.4s)]
*  Have you ever heard of him a little bit? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=405.4s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=406.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=407.4s)]
*  You're like kind of like that or John Knightley, maybe because I think he party during the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=408.4s)]
*  daytime more because he would. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=410.96s)]
*  Yeah, he would. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  That guy's still partying. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=414.12s)]
*  I've seen him. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=415.12s)]
*  I live in Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=416.12s)]
*  I've seen him get a couple of times in ambulances, his Uber basically. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=417.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty crazy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=420.92s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=423.08s)]
*  Oh, I've seen him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=424.08s)]
*  The ambulance got called and there was some confusion as to where he was like on the premises [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=426.68s)]
*  and he went and got in the shotgun of the ambulance. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=431.52s)]
*  He went and got in the passenger seat and just waited. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=435.32s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck is taking you guys so long? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=437.76s)]
*  Take me to the fucking hospital. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=439.56s)]
*  Yeah, just take me to the hospital. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=440.56s)]
*  He's sitting in there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=441.56s)]
*  Gee whiz. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=442.56s)]
*  I'm just running around with like a little, I'm not sure what it's called. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=443.56s)]
*  What's some of like, and I'm not going to just grill you about tennis because I don't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=449.24s)]
*  know a ton about it, but I do want to get like some thoughts that I had. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=452.0s)]
*  What are some things like, because football you kind of know what the physical aspect [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=456.04s)]
*  is and like the training. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=460.0s)]
*  What is shit that people don't know that like tennis training? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=461.8s)]
*  Well tennis is a tough one because you don't know when you're going to play exactly like [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=466.8s)]
*  when the schedule comes out, like for instance, soccer or football or NBA or like you have [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=470.56s)]
*  an exact time when you know where the game's going to start and the duration of how long [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  the game goes for where tennis is. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=479.44s)]
*  You don't know what time you're going to play where it could be at night. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  Could be first match at 10 a.m. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=483.56s)]
*  Could be at 7 p.m. and then it could go for an hour and a half to five hours. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=485.0s)]
*  So it's like, how do you train for something with so many different intangibles and variables? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  That's always been a big challenge for every tennis player. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=493.54s)]
*  It's like you train for something that you don't even know what's coming and there's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=495.68s)]
*  no teammates. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=499.88s)]
*  You're out there on your own. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=500.88s)]
*  And I think that's why tennis players for me, this is one of the toughest sports in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  the world because we're going one week we're in Asia, one week we're in Europe, in the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=508.32s)]
*  States for maybe a month, then Australia. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=512.4s)]
*  It's like different diet, different food, different time zones. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=514.4599999999999s)]
*  And it's like you got to adapt and have that adaptability to be good. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=518.28s)]
*  And that's tough because most other professional athletes like set in stone preparation, food, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=521.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=527.08s)]
*  In tennis is like you just have to go with the flow. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=528.08s)]
*  Dude, I always really struggle with it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=530.72s)]
*  I think. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=532.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  There's like no routine really. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  You have to try and find. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what I've lost my marbles. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, and from Australia as well, it's worse. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  We have like two tournaments a year. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  So the rest of it's just traveling around living out of a hotel. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  To live out of. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=551.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=552.08s)]
*  Because it's hard enough for me. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=553.08s)]
*  Like, I know, I guess it sounds like I'm complaining. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=554.08s)]
*  No, it's definitely a nice lifestyle. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=556.76s)]
*  Like learning about cultures and meeting new people and traveling to the coolest. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=559.76s)]
*  But it's not like, Oh, I think a lot of people think when I'm traveling, I'm like enjoying [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  going sightseeing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  Like I'm working, like, you know, I'm playing, I'm training, I'm going to bed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  Like, it's hard. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=572.04s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=573.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=574.4s)]
*  I mean, last night, like I get off stage and I know that I have to do this today. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=575.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  I know that I have to edit like a previous episode and look over it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, so I'm up for two till probably at two, I went to sleep. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  And not complaining. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=586.12s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=587.12s)]
*  But it's not like, yeah, you get to get out. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=588.12s)]
*  It's like a walk in the park. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=589.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=590.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=591.36s)]
*  And yeah, there's some like, Dame, it's hitting you up. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=592.36s)]
*  She wants to hang out. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=593.72s)]
*  But you're like, I know I have to do what I got to do. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=594.72s)]
*  Or it's going to be, you know, multitasking. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=600.0799999999999s)]

*  You know, that's what I was thinking. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=604.4s)]
*  Nothing, not in a gay way, but I'm just going to save my energy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=605.4s)]
*  I'll look after them though. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=608.48s)]

*  I'll try, I don't really want to drink any wine because then if I have one, I'll have [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=772.2s)]
*  two, then I'll probably go out. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=776.04s)]
*  I don't want to do that because I don't want to feel like shit tomorrow morning. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=777.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=779.96s)]
*  What about you? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=780.96s)]
*  What about you? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=781.96s)]

*  What will we do? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=783.96s)]
*  The show starts an hour early, so we might be able to, we might do something after. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  The only reason, if I will go out tonight, if I'm going out with you, then I'll come. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=789.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=794.6s)]
*  That's the, I'm going to give that deal to my miss. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=795.6s)]
*  If the other one wants to go out, I don't care what else is on the schedule that we're [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=797.96s)]
*  clearing it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  Dear Christ then. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=803.5600000000001s)]
*  We'll tell the miss to put on her heels then. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  Alright, I'm down. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=808.0400000000001s)]
*  She got no excuse then. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=811.2800000000001s)]
*  If your tour starts back up for tennis, how do you jump back into tennis? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=812.6s)]
*  Do you just, can you just go back in at a certain point or do you have to wait till [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=816.12s)]
*  a season starts? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=820.24s)]
*  What's it like? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=821.24s)]
*  So basically there's a ranking system. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=822.24s)]
*  So by me not playing for the last like a year and a half because of injury, I lost my ranking, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=824.4s)]
*  but I have like a protected ranking of like 20. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  So I can come back at pretty much any point in time when I'm healthy and I just slop back [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=831.28s)]
*  in basically. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=836.24s)]
*  Is it scary to be like, all right, I'm ready to go? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=837.24s)]
*  That seems fucking scary. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=840.1999999999999s)]
*  It's on because for me as a player, like there's obviously a lot of eyes because I'm very like [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=841.2s)]
*  controversial and stuff. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=844.48s)]
*  So because you're almost black a little. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=845.84s)]
*  Yeah, maybe in a very white privileged sport like tennis. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=848.12s)]
*  Oh, people see a guy with a tip. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=851.48s)]
*  People see a guy that's been in the sun for a half hour and they're like, oh, look at [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=853.48s)]
*  this brother trying to cause trouble. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there is a bit of that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=858.6s)]
*  There's a bit of that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=859.6s)]
*  But yeah, so I guess when I'm playing, it's like, oh, he's coming back and there's a lot [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=860.6s)]
*  of pressure on it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=864.4200000000001s)]
*  So I need to make sure that when I'm ready to go, then you're ready for all that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=868.12s)]
*  I can't fly. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=869.24s)]
*  I don't fly underneath the radar, which would be nice sometimes. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=870.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, what is he going to do now? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=872.16s)]
*  Yeah, is he going to chew gum during this match? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=874.84s)]
*  God forbid I do that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=879.24s)]
*  Are you allowed to do that? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=880.88s)]
*  Yeah, you can do that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=881.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've done it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=882.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=883.88s)]
*  But like, yeah, you're right. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=884.88s)]
*  Like I walk differently on the court and people are like, look at this deviant gang member. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=885.88s)]
*  Yeah, literally. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=890.76s)]
*  I should show you some articles off this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=891.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=893.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=894.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=895.96s)]
*  Dude, is there any good moments where people yell shit at tennis? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=897.2s)]
*  Because it's such a refined like if you want to get a good like it's probably it's frowned [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=900.44s)]

*  Wimbledon, like you can't say a thing like it's very like you can hear the royal family's [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=908.72s)]
*  there like I was cussing in front of the royal family, which was funny. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=912.72s)]
*  Like it was good. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=915.64s)]

*  Yeah. And like, I mean, I told like there was a time at like in Cali when I was playing [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=926.0s)]
*  and Ben Stiller was in the crowd and one of his friends was like telling me how to play. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=932.0400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, fuck that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=935.52s)]
*  I was like, are you good at tennis? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=936.52s)]
*  Like why are you speaking? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=938.24s)]
*  And then I said to Ben, I was like, do I tell him how to act? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=939.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  No, like I like I love Ben Stiller. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=943.8000000000001s)]
*  But people do scream out some pretty crazy shit. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  Racial stuff sometimes pretty. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=947.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=949.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=950.0s)]
*  And you're not even are you? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=951.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm half Malaysian, half Greek. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=952.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=953.96s)]
*  I am mixed. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=955.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=956.44s)]
*  But you'd have to have a damn calculator to get racist against somebody like you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=957.44s)]
*  I feel like you got to you know, I'm saying you got to really have a chart or something. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=960.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=964.36s)]
*  People are so diverse now. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=965.36s)]
*  If you don't really to really be a good racist, you have to have. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=966.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=969.64s)]
*  You do your research. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=970.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=971.64s)]
*  You got to at least be able to do some math almost. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=972.64s)]
*  I think that's why a lot of racism is disappearing because there's a barrier to entry now because [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=973.76s)]
*  people are so mixed, you know. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=979.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=982.08s)]
*  What do you think about when you see some of these matches like they just said, didn't [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  they just have Jake Paul was going to fight a. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=988.76s)]
*  What do you think about that shit, man? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=989.76s)]
*  It's fucking crazy, isn't it? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=990.76s)]
*  It's fucking dumb, I think. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=992.92s)]
*  Like what are you expecting? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=995.04s)]
*  What do you think the outcome is going to be? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=996.04s)]
*  Well I think. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=997.88s)]
*  Because I thought that Jake Paul would have lost by now, even fighting these guys at some [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=998.88s)]
*  stage, but he keeps winning. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1002.0s)]
*  Like I know that they're not like in their prime or whatever, but the whole background [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  was fighting. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1006.92s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1007.92s)]
*  And he keeps like somehow pulling it out. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1008.92s)]
*  If he pulls this one out, I don't care how old Mike Tyson gets, I'm not even fighting [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1011.5200000000001s)]
*  that guy until he actually sat down on my show. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1015.12s)]
*  He's fucking crazy. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1017.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1018.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1019.6s)]
*  Like I felt I would not fight, even if he's seven years old, I'm not fighting him. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1020.6s)]
*  He just felt like he had that danger in him? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1024.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1026.24s)]
*  Well I asked him, what would you be if you weren't a boxer instead of a fucking criminal? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1027.24s)]
*  Like stone cold in my eyes. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1030.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm like, okay, nice. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1031.92s)]
*  So yeah, if he pulls this one out, what do you think? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1034.24s)]
*  Well I think, I mean, well Jake fought like Nate Robinson who was like... [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1038.28s)]
*  Yeah, Nate should never have taken that fight. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1043.28s)]
*  He like tarnished his whole basketball career. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1045.04s)]
*  He was a Knicks legend. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1047.04s)]
*  And it was just kind of like, oh can Jake beat a black guy? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1048.92s)]
*  That was kind of the ambiance of that when it felt like it and then people were shocked. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1051.72s)]
*  But then he fought Woodley. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1055.76s)]
*  Which is tough. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1057.44s)]
*  Which is tougher, but Woodley has not been the same fighter he's been for years and he [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1058.52s)]
*  hasn't been a good punch thrower. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  What about Diaz? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1064.84s)]
*  I thought Diaz was going to get the job done. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1065.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1067.04s)]
*  And then Silva. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1068.8s)]
*  I thought these guys are like some of the greatest UFC fighters of all time, especially [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1069.8s)]
*  Silva. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1073.28s)]
*  Right, I mean he picked great names, but then now he's kind of gone into boxing. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1074.28s)]
*  He fought Fury. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1077.48s)]
*  Yeah, and he lost that. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1078.48s)]
*  Okay, he lost that one, right? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1079.48s)]
*  He lost to Tommy. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1080.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1081.48s)]
*  He lost to Tommy Fury. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1082.48s)]
*  And I think Tyson could be still a little bit better. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1083.48s)]
*  I would rather fight Fury than Mark Tyson. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1088.68s)]
*  I think. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1089.68s)]
*  Well, I don't, I mean, they had that Tyson against Jones Jr. fight a few years ago, is [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1090.68s)]
*  that right? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  And it was just them hugging basically. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1095.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was basically you paid $50 to watch two brothers hug and which I would do. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1097.44s)]
*  I believe in, you know, you know, I want all my black friends to do well and everything. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1102.72s)]
*  I believe in the community and the culture, but it's like actually, yeah, I would actually [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1107.6s)]
*  pay $50 to watch two brothers hug for an hour. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1111.92s)]
*  Like that would be a great pay-per-view, but they billed it as a boxing match. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1114.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1118.72s)]
*  Jones was gassed out early. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1119.72s)]
*  What was Tyson gassed too? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1122.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1123.72s)]
*  They hugged so quick after any exchange, it was hard to know. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1125.04s)]
*  They didn't want to like force it or risk it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1127.92s)]
*  Yeah, it almost seemed like it was like a... [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1129.92s)]
*  Does this hurt Tyson's legacy if he loses it? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1134.48s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1136.96s)]
*  I think his shit is so locked in. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1137.96s)]
*  Yeah, you think so? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1139.72s)]
*  Now he's all, yeah, I think it is. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1140.72s)]
*  Is it staged at all? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1142.96s)]
*  Now that's the part I don't know. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1144.4s)]
*  I don't know if Tyson's going to agree to say, hey, you can knock me out. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1146.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1149.3600000000001s)]
*  So. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1150.3600000000001s)]
*  You know? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1151.3600000000001s)]
*  The weed can't even knock him out. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, dude, that dude is taking on, let's say this. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1153.8s)]
*  Yes, he fought Leon Holmes or whatever, but he's also fought, you know, Purple Hooker 4.0 [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1156.8s)]
*  weed, you know what I'm saying? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1164.9199999999998s)]
*  Or whatever the strains are, you know? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1166.36s)]
*  He gave me a box of it when I was in LA. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1167.6399999999999s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1169.76s)]
*  Gassed out monster or whatever. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1170.76s)]
*  They keep coming up with different flavors, you know? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1172.76s)]
*  They got the E's too. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1174.3999999999999s)]
*  Kiwi prison and shit. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1175.3999999999999s)]
*  And you're like, fuck, dude, this shit is fucking hard, dude. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  Detroit for your lungs is a new flavor. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1180.48s)]
*  I'm like, that's alarming. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1182.64s)]
*  So I think if he can beat all of that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1185.96s)]
*  When is it? When is the fight? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1189.16s)]
*  June, no? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1191.6s)]
*  Well, Jake had a fight the other day. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1192.32s)]
*  He fought like a footlocker manager. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1193.6s)]
*  Yeah, who what? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1196.04s)]
*  A footlocker manager. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1197.04s)]
*  He basically fought a guy. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1198.04s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1199.04s)]
*  Nobody knew who this guy. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1200.28s)]
*  I didn't know who he was yet. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  Even the guy's father was tweeting like, I didn't know my son was involved in this. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1202.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1205.76s)]
*  Well, there's a good fight right now. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1207.16s)]
*  Joshua Nganu is on now. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1208.44s)]

*  and then I didn't even think about it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1693.24s)]
*  And it was the first time that my brain felt like, oh, thank God. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1695.12s)]

*  Yeah. Do it until you can't do it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1726.04s)]
*  Vapor, though. I'm glad I that solidifies it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1727.64s)]
*  I'm never going to ever touch a vape again. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1730.8s)]
*  Well, you saw that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1732.8s)]
*  Imagine if somebody took a bottle rocket up to a seventh grader. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1733.72s)]
*  Yeah. And just lit one end and said, hey, bub smoked it. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1738.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like tiny, like it seems to be safe. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1741.16s)]
*  Fuck that. It's got the same chemicals as a fucking Fourth of July in it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1744.16s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that's just damn alarming. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1748.48s)]
*  But yeah, I think I'm sure there's probably people trying to get those vapes now, like [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1750.76s)]
*  explosion vapes. That's the thing. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1756.72s)]
*  They'll just market is like a new thing. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1758.76s)]
*  It'll be a new marketing tactic. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1760.36s)]
*  Like, come get these explode, you know, social media. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1762.28s)]
*  Yeah. Somehow turn something like that into a positive. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1765.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty alarming. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1768.76s)]
*  What else do you see? Can people you can't vape out on the court. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1773.0s)]
*  Anybody ever smoke at halftime during your games? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1775.56s)]
*  Well, we don't have a time, but not like. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1777.72s)]
*  Look, I mean, I've the closest thing to something pretty loose on a tennis court [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1782.16s)]
*  is you see someone drinking like a Coca-Cola. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1785.92s)]
*  Like there was back in the old days, I think people used to maybe like [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1788.0s)]
*  there was like a guy who played this actually one of this. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1791.92s)]
*  He played the Williams sisters because like there was a big thing [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  between like can females and males like compete at the same level? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1797.68s)]
*  And then some guy ranked like 200 went out there with like, I think it's [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1801.8s)]
*  you can actually find on the Internet. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1805.44s)]
*  He was smoking a cigarette and having a beer while he played the Williams sisters. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1806.5600000000002s)]
*  And he beat them. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1810.3200000000002s)]
*  But like he was that was probably the last time someone ever smoked a cigarette on court. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1811.1200000000001s)]
*  Wow. It was one verse two. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1814.72s)]
*  No, he he verse Serena. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1816.4s)]
*  I think Venus first and then Serena after. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1817.92s)]
*  So there is a difference in level between the masculine and feminine play usually. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1820.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I believe so. Yeah. I mean, well, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1825.3200000000002s)]
*  there's a genetic difference. There's a yeah, you know, there's a two separate tours. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1827.44s)]
*  Yeah, big time. There's a scientific difference. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1831.4s)]
*  There's also probably a difference in where your body can even move. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1833.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what they are. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1836.44s)]
*  But because I think women have a different [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1837.88s)]
*  caussics or like, I don't know what it's called, hips or whatever, you know? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1841.92s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know, man. Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1846.8400000000001s)]
*  But we we we play for we play like Grand Slam's. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1848.52s)]
*  We play best of five, which can go for like five hours. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1851.56s)]
*  And if you play against a woman or people like do [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1854.0s)]
*  there's mixed doubles, there's mixed doubles. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1857.44s)]
*  Oh, there is. Like I played I played with Venus. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1858.64s)]
*  You get like someone else. Yeah. Wow. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1860.88s)]
*  Mixed doubles is fun. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1863.2s)]
*  I think mixed doubles is actually should be played more because it's entertaining. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1864.28s)]
*  Right. Like it's more fun seeing both sexes on the court at the same time. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1868.0s)]
*  In my opinion, for the fans like me, I never thought I'd play with Venus Williams. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1872.56s)]
*  It's pretty cool. Yeah. Wow. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1876.76s)]
*  I went to Wimbledon one time. Did you? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1879.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing a comedy tour over there in England and we went to damn Wimbledon. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1881.88s)]
*  I remember walking up and being like, I don't fit in here at all. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1887.16s)]
*  I didn't know what we should do. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1890.44s)]
*  I felt like you had to like at least be able to play an instrument or something to get in. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1891.68s)]
*  You know, I just felt like you just had this ticket. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1895.68s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1898.72s)]
*  I was like, damn, I don't know the violin or whatever. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1899.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? It just seemed very, you know, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1901.5600000000002s)]
*  and I remember saluting people at the gala, the game or whatever. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1904.44s)]
*  And the guy's like, fuck you doing it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1907.24s)]
*  Yeah. Now, Wimbledon, it's very proper. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1909.68s)]
*  Yeah. That place hasn't changed in 100 years. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1912.68s)]
*  Does your sport feel too proper ever? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1915.56s)]
*  For me, I mean, well, I just I grew up loving basketball. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1917.72s)]
*  Like I love NBA, watch it religiously. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1921.12s)]
*  And when I played tennis, I always felt like I was a bit of an out, like a misfit. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1923.0s)]
*  Right. And fit in well. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1927.1599999999999s)]
*  So then when I was walking to places like Wimbledon, I was like, this place is it's crazy. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1928.24s)]
*  Like, it's so against what I like. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1932.6s)]
*  I was watching. I love watching basketball, entertainment, American sport for me in general. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1934.32s)]
*  It's like where I fit in. I feel very at home in the States. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1938.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. So, yeah. Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1940.6799999999998s)]
*  It's for me. It's like being at the library, I feel like. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1943.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I mean. And I don't like like my personality in the way I am is like not. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1945.44s)]
*  Close to how traditional sport of tennis is. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1951.16s)]
*  Yeah. Like, you know, I mean, I'm not playing. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1954.72s)]
*  So, yeah, so it's like I've just been in an environment my whole life that I've kind of wanted to break out of. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1956.88s)]
*  But that's the only thing I'm really fucking good at. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1962.24s)]
*  But that's the only thing you're good at. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1964.64s)]
*  Well, I'm good at other things, but that's where like we all have our. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1965.88s)]

*  Why didn't I try to do that? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1989.8s)]
*  You know, and then you have the instruments and the lights and it's a fucking party. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1992.44s)]
*  You know, get out every night. That would be tough. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1996.84s)]
*  No. Don't you think? Yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  To try and you got to match everyone's energy all night. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2001.48s)]
*  How did you get into this? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2003.92s)]
*  Has anyone ever asked you that in a podcast? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2005.4s)]
*  Yeah, just like you. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2007.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, how did it all happen for you? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2009.68s)]
*  Well, because I feel like there was a time where Theo didn't exist in my life. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2011.4s)]
*  And then now it's all I see is you. Yeah. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2016.52s)]
*  So what was the journey like? Oh, that's interesting, man. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2018.68s)]
*  Well, I've done comedy for a long time. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2022.76s)]
*  Right. People forget sometimes, I think. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2025.16s)]
*  I don't think they forget. They just don't know. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2027.4s)]
*  They don't know when you go on stage. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  You've been going on stage for 18 years, even if they only known you about you for four years. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2030.44s)]
*  Comedy is a tough gig, by the way. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2034.92s)]
*  You know, I think it's probably similar in some of the sense. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2036.56s)]
*  I mean, you guys, I couldn't imagine having to do a four hour set, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2039.28s)]
*  but at least you get to hit it to the other person and let them deal with it for a minute. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2042.64s)]
*  Yeah, for a second. Yeah. Yeah. Just for a second. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2045.64s)]
*  Yeah. Mother. OK. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2047.88s)]
*  That's true. You really don't get much of a fright. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2049.7200000000003s)]
*  You're like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2052.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2054.96s)]
*  But then when I think social media really got crazy, you know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2056.68s)]
*  like everything was going good with podcasting. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2060.12s)]
*  That really helped because we felt caged up by like the entertainment industry. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2063.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's the same people making the same choices. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2067.48s)]
*  It's a very secular group, you know, over there. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2070.64s)]
*  And it's like, and if they don't kind of pick you to be the person [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2074.76s)]
*  or something they see or they don't like some of your vision, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2080.64s)]
*  then they don't push you forward. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2083.6s)]
*  But if you tell me that, I'm going to fucking find a way forward. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2086.28s)]
*  That's all that's the only thing I've ever known is I never want to do shit your way anyway. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2090.96s)]
*  So I don't even know what the fuck I was doing here pretending I was. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2096.56s)]
*  That's the saddest part sometimes for me. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2099.4s)]
*  But but you know, I don't say that like, I don't know. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2101.16s)]
*  I say that I think some of that's in hindsight at the time. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2105.76s)]
*  Yeah, you you want to go with you want to try the path that's there. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2108.88s)]
*  I yeah, I was going on podcasts and then I walked out of Joe Rogan's podcast one day [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2114.4s)]
*  and I was like, I just want to just have my own thing. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2119.52s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to have my own thing. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2123.88s)]
*  And thank God that, you know, there was people like Mark Marin and Rogan. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2126.7599999999998s)]
*  There was a fighter in the kid, which was an early podcast with Brandon [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2133.0s)]
*  Schaub and Brian Callum, like there was just these things. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2136.36s)]
*  Pete Holmes. There was a lot of pot. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2139.92s)]
*  And it was like a thing. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2142.8799999999997s)]
*  And I just started in my kitchen and then it's social media. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2144.04s)]
*  Like people, other people made clips and that like got things like to a different [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2148.6s)]
*  place, like when people started taking stuff and making it just putting it out there. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because then you're you're spreading. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2157.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're spreading it, but you're not doing the spreading. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2160.2s)]
*  Yeah. So it's kind of alarming, too, because you then you can't control the spread. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2162.2799999999997s)]
*  That's true. That's what I was going to ask you, because because I feel like today's [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2166.3599999999997s)]
*  day and age with what you say and stuff, but I feel like you don't filter anything, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2169.16s)]
*  but you're still saying what you want to say. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2172.04s)]
*  Like a lot of people don't. I know that I can't say things like sitting with you right now. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2174.0s)]
*  I know that I could be as honest as anything, but if I said something slightly controversial, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2178.04s)]
*  it would affect my career drastically. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2182.68s)]
*  If you text it, I'll yell it out. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2184.96s)]
*  See, that's what I'm saying. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2187.12s)]
*  That's what I I'm kind of jealous in that way, because, like, oh, yeah, I'm from Australia. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2188.04s)]
*  Right. And I'm already against the eight ball. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2191.64s)]
*  Like the media is always against me to create this reputation that like I'm a bad guy or whatever. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2193.32s)]
*  What do you even do? You just wore high socks. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2198.12s)]
*  Through a tennis racket or some shit. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2201.76s)]
*  But it's like, I kind of envy the fact that you can be so honest. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2203.48s)]
*  Oh, I see. Well, I think if you're already kind of leaning into some of this world with your own voice, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2206.1600000000003s)]
*  because that's really what you're doing, I think, with podcasting. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  I think some people we don't even realize it maybe is that you're just trying to have your own voice. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2213.92s)]
*  Right. That's a part of it in our psyche, I think. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2220.2400000000002s)]
*  And I don't say that from like a preachy point. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2224.2000000000003s)]
*  I say it, I think, from a realization point, even for me just now. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2225.92s)]
*  It's like, oh, I just want to have my own voice. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2228.52s)]
*  So I think if you want to have that, then it'll probably be something that you have down the line. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2231.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, if you're having seeds of it come into your own existence now. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2235.72s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like people are embracing it a little bit more. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2239.4s)]
*  But still, I would like to be a bit more honest. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2241.44s)]
*  Yeah. Some things one day you'll get to, man. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2243.12s)]
*  I hope so. Yeah, because I guess it does feel caged up. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2245.08s)]
*  Well, I think if you work within a network. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2247.6s)]
*  You know, we had this guy, Trevor Bauer, on recently, and he's a pitcher and he got maligned in the states [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2251.12s)]
*  for some sexual allegations, right? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2256.96s)]
*  And then he played in Japan and it came to be there was never any [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2259.6800000000003s)]
*  any prosecution or anything. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  And one of the people pressing charges or the main person pressing charges, it was there wasn't any validity there. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2268.12s)]
*  It was dishonest. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2273.76s)]
*  But they he never really has gotten back on his feet for. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2275.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but the damage is probably done because. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2278.64s)]
*  Right. The damage was done. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2280.64s)]
*  But also, I think he had been somebody who kind of wanted to have their own voice in his sport, like he had started. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2282.2799999999997s)]
*  He has a YouTube platform and he would comment about things he didn't love about the sport as well. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2288.3599999999997s)]
*  So I think that kind of once you're within a bigger group, you kind of have to work with the rules of the group. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2295.08s)]
*  You know, so who does your stuff like all so you do like your show, this podcast, and then you go to show tonight. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2303.72s)]
*  Like, who do you answer to? Or do you just run on your own schedule? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2309.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we just run on our own schedule. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2312.0s)]
*  But yeah, but I don't play professional sport if I also was playing within a. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2313.88s)]
*  And then, you know, you probably if you say something, then it comes the tennis. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2318.04s)]
*  What's the overall tennis thing called? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2322.36s)]
*  Major league tennis. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2324.48s)]
*  It's just called ATP. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2325.4s)]
*  Like the yeah, that's all it is. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2326.36s)]
*  ATP. They would be like, what's going on? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2327.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2330.12s)]
*  So it probably cages you up some. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2331.36s)]
*  You definitely got to come when I'm coming back. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2333.64s)]
*  You got to come and watch. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2335.36s)]
*  Dude, that would be sick. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2336.36s)]
*  Epic, bro. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2337.4s)]
*  Yeah, because the only one we could get into at Wimbledon, I think it was Wimbledon. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2338.28s)]
*  It could have been a fucking high school match, but we it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2341.44s)]
*  Somebody said it was Wimbledon. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2345.8s)]
*  Did you remember the Kentucky Derby, actually? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2347.28s)]
*  What? When was it? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2349.36s)]
*  When is Wimbledon? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2350.6s)]
*  Oh, July. I got to look back and see. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2352.88s)]
*  I got to ask my friend. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2355.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't even remember that disappoints me. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2356.16s)]
*  Yeah, because my job is when people like not tennis fans, they come and watch. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2358.96s)]
*  They actually remember the fuck's playing. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2363.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's what I've been criticized doing. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2364.68s)]
*  Like, oh, he's not even like playing tennis the traditional way. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2366.4s)]
*  I'm like, they have one game to win. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2368.84s)]
*  Wimbledon doesn't even know who played. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2370.44s)]
*  That should be like a message to the ATP right now. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2371.7200000000003s)]
*  Like we're doing a terrible job. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2373.44s)]
*  Yeah, do they do is it this that they have a tough time like? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2375.64s)]
*  I guess there's fear of like if they start to individualize people [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2380.32s)]
*  too much over the sport, then it gives a lot more power to the players themselves. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2383.84s)]
*  I don't know. I wonder what that's like. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2388.52s)]
*  Like, yeah, like that. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2390.16s)]
*  I mean, everyone knows who the players are, who bring fans [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2391.64s)]
*  and why ticket sales get sold and all that type of stuff. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2395.7200000000003s)]
*  Like everyone knows that. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2398.6s)]
*  And the ATP likes to hide the fact that they think it's a lot of an equal thing, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2400.0s)]
*  but it's not like the fact that there's a tennis player sitting in your podcast [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2404.6s)]
*  right now, like that's pretty cool. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2409.3599999999997s)]

*  who ended up he was kind of an alcoholic, to be honest with you. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2417.9599999999996s)]
*  But he cheated on their mom. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2421.2s)]
*  But he played tennis a lot in the mornings, I remember. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2423.0s)]
*  And he would I would catch him at nights when I was looking at porno on the computer. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2428.8s)]
*  But he was a good, pretty good tennis player. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2432.84s)]

*  It would be cool if at certain points, like the net lit up or something [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2579.32s)]
*  and there was like a spice round or something. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2583.32s)]

*  How can it change, though? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2592.0s)]
*  That's what's interesting, too, is some sports you wonder if they just. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2593.1600000000003s)]
*  I've hit like hit the ceiling almost. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2597.16s)]

*  But you wonder, I never thought about that. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2604.7999999999997s)]
*  Do some sports start to have they just had their time and existence like bocce ball? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2607.0s)]
*  What is that? Yeah, what is it? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2613.0s)]
*  Great question. I don't know, but I know at one point it was one of the top 11 sports in the whole world. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2614.9199999999996s)]
*  When was bocce ball big, brother? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2620.9599999999996s)]

*  You pull that up. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2624.92s)]
*  Tennis, I guess it's just because they're I think they're afraid to lose the lifelong fans that they've had. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2625.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yes. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2631.7200000000003s)]

*  But then you also how does the sport survive? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2634.6400000000003s)]
*  It gets you have to like I'm not a big I wasn't a big UFC guy at all. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2636.36s)]
*  And now I like watching it. Yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2641.6400000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like if they just stayed true to their fighting fans, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2643.1600000000003s)]
*  like I think I've done an amazing job marketing press conferences. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2646.08s)]
*  Tennis has none of that. Like tennis. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2649.52s)]
*  We don't even have like if we had a press conference before the match, that would be good. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2651.16s)]
*  But now we only have post. You know what I mean? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2656.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it could use something. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2658.44s)]
*  Yeah. How do you spice it up? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2660.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's kind of it definitely is challenging because it's like with any brand. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2662.24s)]
*  It's like, how do you cater to, you know, like we have a we have some young audience members. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2666.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll be like around, you know, kids, kids. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2672.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And they're like, what the fuck? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2676.48s)]
*  We will say that in front of their parents and the parents are like, you can't say what the fuck. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2679.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like, I can say it to him. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2682.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. But I think I don't know this kid. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2684.12s)]
*  If you strip it back, like you just you're teaching people to just be yourself and be comfortable in your own skin. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2686.6s)]
*  And, you know, I think you at the end of the day, it's not. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2692.12s)]
*  This is a slight word. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2696.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I think the alarming part is when they say it in front of the parent and then they're like, yeah, this guy says it. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2697.96s)]
*  And I'm like, and then because it is this moment like me and the kid know each other and it's like, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2702.6s)]

*  Just so the parent knows that I do use the word. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2714.6400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, but yeah, it's like but yeah, with everything on the Internet, though, I don't think watching you swear is that bad compared to some of the shit that's on there now. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2716.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. Like it's very less of the two evils. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=2726.0400000000004s)]

*  arrested after police find body parts in freezer. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3552.6s)]
*  This guy, something Johnson was it? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3556.36s)]
*  Wait, wait, sorry. So, so, wait. So he went to prison. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3558.92s)]
*  He got out. He went to prison. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3561.24s)]
*  An ex-convict who claimed to have turned his life around after Joe Rogan's podcast [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3562.08s)]
*  has been arrested and charged with murder. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3565.36s)]
*  Sheldon Johnson, 48, had been on the Joe Rogan experience and discussed [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3566.88s)]
*  his justice reform advocacy in an episode that aired just last month. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3570.92s)]
*  Johnson had previously spent over two decades behind bars [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3575.16s)]
*  after sentenced for attempted murder and robbery. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3578.7599999999998s)]
*  So he spent two decades. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3582.0s)]
*  And then he got out and then he went on the podcast and they just found this recently. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3583.4s)]
*  Yes. And then he just now. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3586.6400000000003s)]
*  Cured somebody and then just chuck it, stuck it in the freezer. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3590.36s)]
*  And I think, yeah, at least. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3593.76s)]
*  He put him in the free. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3597.36s)]
*  I knew I knew something like that. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3598.36s)]
*  Well, I'm just what do you do? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3600.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3601.48s)]
*  I'm just saying this. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3603.32s)]
*  That is not at least wise, at least at the front of that road. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3604.48s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you're right. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3607.6s)]
*  But we mean at least that there's some level of decency. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3608.48s)]
*  I feel like if you just kill someone and leave them out to spoil or whatever, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3611.32s)]
*  that's fucking horrible. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3615.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3618.8s)]
*  I just think that person just needs to get put away again. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3620.84s)]
*  Well, yes, I think we can both agree with that, Nicholas. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3624.2400000000002s)]
*  But I'm just saying that I believe. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3626.6000000000004s)]
*  But what happens if you put in the freezer because he wanted to do something to it [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3629.6400000000003s)]
*  afterwards like that's like sick in the head? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3632.48s)]
*  Well, that's very sick. Yes. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3634.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think if it's just a level of like, oh, gosh. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3635.96s)]
*  At least let me do my best by them now by. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3639.48s)]
*  Yeah, I would. Yeah, I guess you're right. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3646.56s)]
*  I mean, yeah. But did he put the whole body in? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3648.6s)]
*  What did he do? Let's see what he did, at least for we make a judgment. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3650.8s)]
*  This is on this. You should search up. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3653.84s)]

*  Like a tennis player, you know, we kind of like hit maneuver, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3985.92s)]
*  like very calculated for our next move. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3988.52s)]
*  We're here. It's like you want to throw one. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3991.28s)]
*  You have to stay put. I'm not doing that, bro. Sorry. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3993.44s)]
*  And also, you're tall. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3995.76s)]
*  So if people I feel like we're aiming up, it would just be all they would really be able to. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=3996.88s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know the angles and how it affects what what's best, you know. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4001.1200000000003s)]

*  I like that guy. Yeah. Bring him up. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4012.0s)]
*  He's dope. Wolverine and Toppin, I think his name is T-U-P-P-I-N. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4014.1200000000003s)]
*  He's awesome to watch. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4019.1600000000003s)]
*  You got to watch him versus Toppin, I think. T-U-P-P-I-N. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4021.32s)]
*  I went to one. I'm going to one in a couple of weeks. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4024.48s)]
*  So crowds are big there. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4027.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it's not as big. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4029.28s)]
*  It's pretty small. It's intimate. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4030.92s)]
*  This is what this is. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4032.84s)]
*  This is this guy's nuts. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4033.76s)]
*  Wolverine versus Turpin. Yeah. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4036.2000000000003s)]
*  Light heavy match. Oh, no, the one I didn't see was wasn't for the title. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4038.84s)]
*  And this dude Turpin's face. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4042.84s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are nuts. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4048.44s)]
*  He knocked that guy's a cap a cig. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4054.52s)]
*  I think he knocked him out. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4056.32s)]
*  Sometimes I think a slap like that would hurt more than a punch. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4058.04s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4063.2000000000003s)]
*  Honestly, sometimes I do think that like this guy just watches ready bang bang. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4064.04s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4068.84s)]
*  Dude, he's always look, he's singing the national anthem. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4076.84s)]
*  He's definitely fired up right there. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4081.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, in that come on, I don't even have a chin. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4084.5600000000004s)]
*  He's definitely hiding whatever he may have a unique chin under there. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4086.04s)]
*  It's very hard to hit somebody like that. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4090.48s)]
*  Yeah, but and I wonder if you can get down low like. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4092.32s)]
*  No, because you can't because that's called clubbing. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4095.52s)]
*  I think if you get down low and try and club, I think it has to be a legal slap. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4097.12s)]
*  Because all the thing about legal slaps, how you throw it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4100.76s)]
*  And then if someone flinches, they get to slap again. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4103.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Heaps of all these rules. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4106.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4107.64s)]
*  What if someone just screams like a little girl? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4108.52s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4110.56s)]
*  That would happen. I would do it. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4111.8s)]
*  I don't care. Oh, I would do that first. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4113.2s)]
*  So at least if you get hit after, it would be like, well, I'd be like, oh, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4115.360000000001s)]
*  and then just get fucking drilled. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4119.84s)]
*  Can you bring up what are the rules of power slap is a great question. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4121.4s)]
*  Yeah, power slap is nuts. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4124.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I went one time and like there was Cowboy Cerrone was there. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4127.24s)]
*  So Strickland. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4130.32s)]
*  It's definitely a lot of like influencer, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4133.04s)]
*  entertainers, a lot of Dana White's friends are there. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4136.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's very much like a friendly thing. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4140.839999999999s)]
*  Who strikes first in power slap, a coin toss or seeding method [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4143.719999999999s)]
*  will determine who gets to elect the slap or defend first. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4146.879999999999s)]
*  The clock, you have 30 seconds to slap, 30 seconds to recover. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4151.639999999999s)]
*  Repeat. Wow. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4154.48s)]
*  Bro, that is a short amount of time. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4156.16s)]
*  30 seconds. Yeah, that's that's that's quick. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4158.0s)]
*  Weight classes are consistent with MMA. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4160.16s)]
*  So there is a weight class. I didn't realize that rounds. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4162.12s)]
*  The number of rounds depends on the format, with the minimum being three. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4164.839999999999s)]
*  In each round, both competitors have the opportunity to deliver [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4168.599999999999s)]
*  a single strike to their opponent's face and the obligation to receive [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4171.679999999999s)]
*  their opponent's strike and return method of victory. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4175.2s)]
*  KO, TKO and points. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4178.96s)]
*  Like boxing and MMA power slap judging is based on a 10 point must system [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4181.2s)]
*  with a round winner scoring 10 points and the opponent scoring nine or fewer. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4186.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. So Dana White owns this as well, right? Yes. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4190.24s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. That's it's unbelievable. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4194.76s)]
*  Yeah. And this is this is, according to Dana, one of the most [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4198.4400000000005s)]
*  like. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4203.76s)]
*  Viral things that happens when it happens. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4206.28s)]
*  Yeah, fouls, striker fouls include clubbing, clubbing, stepping. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4208.84s)]
*  So I guess I'd be making an actual step with your foot. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4213.56s)]
*  Illegal wind up. Oh, I'd be way guilty of that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4215.52s)]
*  And delay of flinching, blocking delay of game. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4219.12s)]
*  Wow. The complete power slap rules that we posted shortly. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4222.4800000000005s)]
*  Huh? Pretty cool. Yeah, that's crazy, man. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4227.0s)]
*  You think you could do it? No, I don't think I'm like I don't getting hit. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4229.24s)]
*  No, not your thing. No. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4234.320000000001s)]
*  Um, what is one of the scariest moments in a tennis match? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4236.2s)]
*  Are there moments where you find like because I'm sure so much of it is rhythm. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4240.12s)]
*  You've done it so much, right? Yep. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4244.0s)]
*  Is there moments where you feel out of rhythm and you're like, fuck, this is like. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4246.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, big time. Or like at US Open, I was playing quarterfinals, US Open. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4250.68s)]
*  And I was like US Open, Arthur Ashe Stadium is one of the biggest stadiums in the world for tennis. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4256.04s)]
*  Like it's literally you walk to the back of the court, you look up, it's like a sea of people. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4259.92s)]
*  Just like staring down at you and it's really loud and you have celebrities there like Michael Jordan was there once. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4263.44s)]
*  Like pretty lit. Like it's it's a surreal feeling walking out to a court like that in front of like 60,000. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4269.16s)]
*  And then you do it like millions of people watching around the world. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4275.2s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, if you're playing horrible, like, and you know, deep down, if you're not having a good day, like on court and you can't fix it. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4277.5199999999995s)]
*  Because it's like you can't just like instantly fix it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4285.36s)]
*  You got to be like, shit, I can't just sub off here or pause the game or take a timeout. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4287.48s)]
*  It's like the game just keeps going. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4291.32s)]
*  You've got to just problem solve like on the go. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4293.5599999999995s)]
*  It's fucking hard. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4295.759999999999s)]
*  And like, is it possible to turn it around in a match? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4297.24s)]
*  Is it possible? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4299.8s)]
*  Yes, because in a grand slam, it's like you have you have to win three sets. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4300.5199999999995s)]
*  So even if you lose the first two, you have time to figure it out and turn it around. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4305.08s)]
*  But it's fucking hard. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4310.08s)]
*  It's why Novak and Federer and Nadal have been so dominant for so long, because in the grand slam, it's so hard to get on top of them for that long. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4312.96s)]
*  Like pause, like you can get on. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4320.72s)]
*  You might win a set or two. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4323.400000000001s)]
*  Like that's like two hours, but then they'll eventually start figuring you out. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4325.04s)]
*  And it's just like, and is there actual coaching that helps or is it just at that point, you know what's going on? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4328.72s)]
*  Everyone knows everyone's strengths and weaknesses just about execution at that point. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4334.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4339.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4339.96s)]
*  Like when you're out there alone, like your coach can yell something out, but if you can't execute, it's not going to happen. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4340.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4347.280000000001s)]
*  It's pretty it's it's a brutal sport, man. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4348.360000000001s)]
*  Is it? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4350.64s)]
*  I don't think people give it enough credit, especially the top. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4350.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4355.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I, yeah, because it to stay that long, four hours of doing and who does anything, you know, unless you're like, just doing something. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4356.280000000001s)]
*  That's such a commitment. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4368.240000000001s)]
*  And you have to be mentally locked in too. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4369.72s)]
*  Like are there ever points you to zone out? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4371.96s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes I just throw a game or a set like just to mentally reset for sure. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4374.4400000000005s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4379.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4380.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4380.72s)]
*  Because it's hard. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4381.200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4381.6s)]
*  So that's almost part of the strategy too. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4381.92s)]
*  You're like, yeah, it's like boxing. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4383.4400000000005s)]
*  Like you put your hands down for a little bit, like, or, you know, just taking a little bit of a pause. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4384.56s)]
*  People I've been accused of like not trying or like it's called tanking, you know, just giving the opponent easy points. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4389.04s)]
*  And it's just like, I'm just trying to compose myself to go again. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4394.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4396.92s)]
*  It's like a boxer does it. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4397.160000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't accuse him of just like not trying. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4398.12s)]
*  It's just like a tactic, you know? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4400.84s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4402.64s)]
*  Todd. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4403.52s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4404.84s)]
*  Damn. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4405.64s)]
*  I never realized that. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4406.0s)]
*  I never even thought about it. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4407.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4408.08s)]
*  I never even thought about what it would be like to be out there for so long. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4408.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4411.88s)]
*  And then if you're not doing well, then too, how do you even keep going? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4412.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4418.0s)]
*  You got to have, you got to have a short term memory loss or like you have to be a good loser in tennis because you lose every week. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4418.5599999999995s)]
*  Essentially, like you have to win six matches to win a tournament and Novak, these greatest of all time are usually winning these tournaments. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4423.96s)]
*  So like you win, then you go lose and you just like reset next week, new country. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4431.36s)]
*  Like losing is just part of the process really. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4435.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4437.719999999999s)]
*  Which is hard. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4438.639999999999s)]
*  And is there much camaraderie amongst the players and stuff or do you get to? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4440.04s)]
*  Another cool thing. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4443.719999999999s)]
*  Like we shout, like any other pro sport, you have your own locker room, like you eat separately. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4444.5599999999995s)]
*  Like tennis, you're all in one locker room. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4448.5199999999995s)]
*  Like I'm showering and I'm eating and I'm spending time with my opponent before going out there and playing. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4450.0s)]
*  No. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4455.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4455.92s)]
*  And then we like, you might be out there four hours playing and then you just like next to each other again, straight after the match. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4456.4s)]
*  No. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4461.639999999999s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4462.2s)]
*  Oh, is that so, is sometimes that really uncomfortable? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4464.16s)]
*  You're like, I do not want to be around this person anymore. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4467.96s)]
*  Like we just competed and we could get into a bit of a, like a scuffle on the court or like argument. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4470.64s)]
*  Then you're like sharing next to the guys. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4474.76s)]
*  Like the fuck is this? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4475.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4477.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4478.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4480.44s)]
*  Like Wimbledon final, me and Novak in the same locker room, like right next to each other. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4481.36s)]
*  And then we're walking out together, eating together. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4486.0s)]
*  Then we play like the final. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4488.04s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4490.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4491.56s)]
*  Why would they, they should film all of that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4492.32s)]
*  Why isn't that the first three sets, dude? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4494.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4496.6s)]
*  You guys just, you know, having soup next to each other just angrily. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4496.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4500.68s)]
*  I'll see why that isn't the first. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4501.2s)]
*  Yep. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4503.2s)]
*  Oh, it's so intense. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4503.68s)]
*  Yep. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4504.88s)]
*  What's in any other news, anything else that popped up that was in our list, man? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4506.2s)]
*  And we'll get you out of here, Nick. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4509.12s)]
*  Easy, brother. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4510.28s)]
*  This is about AI. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4511.64s)]
*  Jensen Huang, who I'm going to assume is... [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4515.0s)]
*  ASEAN. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4522.52s)]
*  ASEAN. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4524.0s)]
*  Um, at the recent world government summit in Dubai, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4525.4800000000005s)]
*  counterintuitive break with what he thinks is a long tradition of tech CEOs, advising [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4531.64s)]
*  youngsters to learn how to code. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4535.72s)]
*  Huang argued that even at this early stage of the artificial intelligence revolution, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4537.4400000000005s)]
*  programming is no longer a vital skill. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4541.88s)]
*  With coding taken care of by AI, humans can instead focus on more valuable expertise [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4544.120000000001s)]
*  like biology, education, manufacturing, or farming. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4549.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4554.96s)]
*  I agree with it. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4555.6s)]
*  You do? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4557.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4557.4s)]
*  Because it's like anything you leave down to like computers and AI, if it's something [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4557.64s)]
*  to do with numbers for sure, it'd get done probably way more, like 10 times more [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4561.16s)]
*  accurate and done in the shortest, shorter period of time. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4565.6s)]
*  But here's one thing that's interesting about AI is like, if they can program the [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4568.76s)]
*  backend of AI, right? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4572.76s)]
*  Then they'll be able to start to dictate like what even is created or written. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4574.72s)]
*  Like, and what history is in it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4578.96s)]
*  Like I say, if they only put a certain history in AI and they only say one side of [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4580.88s)]
*  history or they don't, you know, then if you're even writing a paper and you want to [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4585.6s)]
*  use AI to help you or a script or creating a piece of art, the information it's going [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4589.88s)]
*  to give back. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4594.8s)]
*  That's what I start to worry because like, imagine if you wrote a note to somebody, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4595.92s)]
*  yeah, but the paper determined what you could actually say in the note. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4600.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4604.88s)]
*  Like you had limitations. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4605.08s)]
*  It had to be one way. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4606.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4607.24s)]
*  The paper wouldn't let you put certain words. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4607.52s)]
*  You wrote certain words. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4609.120000000001s)]
*  They disappeared and they replaced it with another word that the paper felt like was [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4609.88s)]
*  more accurate. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4614.72s)]
*  It's arguably what the media is right now though. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4615.52s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4617.56s)]
*  That's exactly what the media is. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4618.4400000000005s)]
*  But I think, yeah, I agree. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4619.64s)]
*  But if this, if AI can do that, they'll, then it's like even say someone, your mom [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4622.320000000001s)]
*  wanted to make a post on Facebook or something. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4628.280000000001s)]
*  They put it up, but it only allows you to say even so then we're all just only [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4630.240000000001s)]
*  allowed to say the same things, you know? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4634.200000000001s)]
*  And look, AI would never be able to take over say like podcasting or sport and [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4636.2s)]
*  stuff because people watch that because of the personalities and the unknown [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4639.68s)]
*  outcome. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4643.04s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4643.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4644.2s)]
*  So we're safe. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4644.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4646.12s)]
*  You would think. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4646.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're safe. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4646.96s)]
*  I think we're safe. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4647.5199999999995s)]
*  You would think. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4648.32s)]
*  One of my friends was saying the other day that he thinks like at a certain point, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4649.12s)]
*  they won't even need actors for movies anymore because it will just be the [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4652.2s)]
*  likeness of people. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4655.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4657.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4657.36s)]
*  So people will just give their likeness. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4657.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4659.76s)]
*  That's, that's pretty crazy. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4660.5599999999995s)]
*  It is crazy. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4661.8s)]
*  That's what gets me scared. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4662.44s)]
*  Because what if one day you just get to sit at home and then it's just like a, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4663.0s)]
*  and see how you do at the U S open. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4667.08s)]
*  Yeah, that would be crazy. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4669.96s)]
*  Like they extract your self from you, but you just kind of just what, yeah, that [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4671.32s)]
*  honestly, I wouldn't mind a day off. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4675.76s)]
*  You know, like I actually wouldn't mind that having that option. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4682.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4684.52s)]
*  You know? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4685.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4685.44s)]
*  Like, you know what? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4685.64s)]
*  I'm going to put my AI in today and see how he does. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4686.08s)]
*  I'm okay if it comes back and it's a loss. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4688.08s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4689.6s)]
*  That would be good. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4690.56s)]
*  Bro, that would be so good. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4691.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do it autopilot. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4693.5599999999995s)]
*  Did it be so nice? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4696.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4697.4s)]
*  But then it sucks though, for like a farmer who's like, I'm going to send my AI to [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4697.68s)]
*  work and then it's just, you know, nothing gets watered. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4701.16s)]
*  Just no corn. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Zpc7GSzMA&t=4705.92s)]
