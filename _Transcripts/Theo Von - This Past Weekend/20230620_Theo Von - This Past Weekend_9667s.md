*  in the ceiling of the YMCA. What? Yeah, this was in Santa Monica. They found a Korean in the ceiling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=166.32s)]
*  and so they shut everything down. One time the police came in and raided him. He'd been going [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=176.8s)]
*  there for years. He'd been sneaking. He's one of those, people are, what's that new thing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=182.4s)]
*  People are hiding in people's homes or whatever. Nesting. Yeah, nesting. Yeah. They nest in your [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=191.36s)]
*  house. You don't know. They come down and drink your milk. Right. Sorry. Yeah, that's what's going [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=198.16s)]
*  on. It's like there was, and this guy was nesting in the YMCA. Not a bad place to nest. Oh no. And [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=202.08s)]
*  I would, I remember I saw him for years. Sorry, Zach. I was a bit abrupt there. I'm having a long, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=212.4s)]
*  I'm having a long day and it's only this time. You are, Theo, what happened? Well, there's people in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=216.96s)]
*  the ceiling, brother. There's people in my ceiling right now. You know, there's squatters. I got [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=221.52s)]
*  Koreans in my brain. I got brothers in my head. Who knows what else? Yeah, man, it would be so [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  wonderful to have some brain scanning device that showed you a visual depiction of all the various [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=230.0s)]
*  entities, whatever they may be, whether it's, you know, psychological structures or authentic [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=237.36s)]
*  demons. So you could just get the rundown, like when you get blood tests, you know? Yeah. Cause [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=242.08s)]
*  then you know, you know, like why you're acting the way you act sometimes, not you specifically, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=246.32s)]
*  but you know, when the monster pops out. Oh, I think that that's, you know, I wonder a lot if we [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=251.52s)]
*  do, I was just talking about this with on Rogan the other day, if we do enough of the right testing, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=257.44s)]
*  like, like we take people's temperature, like that's such a temperature is such a, who cares? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=262.96s)]
*  You can almost guess it, you know, if you're just, if you're anybody with a thermometer or with [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=269.6s)]
*  two cents, you know, finger. Yeah. Like you could be, you could touch somebody like, oh, you're warm [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=274.24s)]
*  or you're cold. You know, you're dead. You're alive. You know, it's like, but I feel like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=279.2s)]
*  it, we just, we have such primitive testing. It still feels like that we're allowed to see. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=284.16s)]
*  Right. I would love to know. Yeah. What's, what the, who's in here today? Right. What skeletons [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=289.04s)]
*  are out? Yeah. What unaddressed trauma is about to explode out of me in the middle of traffic? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=294.64s)]
*  Yeah. And then you'll know. And then maybe it won't happen, but this is, yeah, I, man, it's, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, I think the testing we have on the human body is pretty remarkable. Right. Like you can do, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=308.64s)]
*  like you don't even have to get the, what the prostate thing, you know, where they shove the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  tube and cut the polyps. It's disgusting. It's like a haircut for your intestines. I gotta get [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=320.08s)]
*  one soon. But the, you could just do like some tests that tells you if, you know, you've got a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=325.2s)]
*  problem. Yeah. You don't have to get the Michael Jackson drug and then have this long tube that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=332.4s)]
*  your doctor is weirdly like excited to tell you about. Yeah. He's listening to Billie Jean while [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  he puts it in you. My doctor was so excited. He's like, you'll be able to see your appendix. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=345.76s)]
*  Like, I don't want to see my fucking appendix. I never want to see it. I want to die without [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  seeing my appendix. But anyway, now they can just test it. I can't remember what the name of it is. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=357.28s)]
*  The worst commercial on TV. It's like a, like an annoying corrective animation, like interrupts [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=362.08s)]
*  people when they're swimming and it's like, have you had your asshole checked? It's a stupid [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=368.56s)]
*  commercial. But the point is if they can do that, it's interesting. The mind, the mind is like [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=372.96s)]
*  the ocean. You know, we have no idea what's going on in there. Like it's the biggest part of planet [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=378.88s)]
*  earth and we barely know what's down there. It's really curious. Well, in the ocean too, man, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=384.64s)]
*  the ocean, a lot of it is, most of the animals are by the edge. Yeah. Right. Like the, you're [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=390.48s)]
*  talking like down there in those thermal vents, it starts low population density. And what is down [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=397.04s)]
*  there is like, is terrifying. Well, it's the same type of people that live. I think if you get out [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  in a very rural Utah or you get out into like, you go deep into the mountains or into some caverns [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=408.24s)]
*  or something, you find some real cryptic homies out there. Oh my dude. You know, when I was in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=414.96s)]
*  Asheville, the last day of my kid's preschool, right before we left, I met a psychologist whose [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  job was to go out into deep Appalachia and like, you know, it's, that's where all his clients were [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=428.64s)]
*  and just what you're saying, like the stuff going on out there is crazy. Like he was telling me [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=435.28s)]
*  one of his patients took a scythe and went to this dude's trailer where I guess he's sitting [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  watching TV and use the scythe to cut through the trailer into the dude's back. Like the wall with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=447.92s)]
*  a scythe. You're just watching like American Ninja challenge and a scythe comes through your [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=459.12s)]
*  fucking trailer. But how interactive is that? I mean, you couldn't, no matter what cable you paid [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=465.92s)]
*  for, rarely would you be watching American Ninja and then an actual bootleg fucking meth ninja rolls [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  up with a scythe and cracks through your homestead. Like 80% moonshine just filled with that kind of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  moonshine that makes your eyes turn white and he just fucking, something sparks in his brain. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=489.68s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to do it today. And he goes and scythes someone's trailer. It's crazy. That's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=495.92s)]
*  our minds. We have our back roads and we have our dark bowers and secret places. Some people never [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  ever even know. They just think they're like the first thing that comes to their mind. They don't [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=509.92s)]
*  know that like there's a lot of shit down there. Yeah, they don't know that there's people pushing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=514.72s)]
*  people to the front of the class to say something. They think that, oh, that's the first thought I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=519.28s)]
*  have, but they don't know there's all these dark arts in the distance pushing people forward. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=523.28s)]
*  I think my mind a lot of time is like, what's that black street that they burned down or whatever, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=527.12s)]
*  Zach, that was like a holly, that was like black. It was like fancy. It was like the first black, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=531.68s)]
*  like main street. You talk about black Wall Street in Tulsa. Yeah, that was, yeah, I can pull that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=538.72s)]
*  They burn it down? They burned it down a long time ago. I'm not sure what exactly happened. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=546.64s)]
*  It may have been racism. It may have just been fireworks. I don't know what it was. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=552.88s)]
*  White residents attacked black residents, homes and businesses, as well as cultural [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=558.08s)]
*  public institutions in Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, an oil boom city. Black Wall Street, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=561.52s)]
*  one of the wealthiest black communities. So it was like you're kind of your early Atlanta. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=568.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ, they burn it all down. Yeah, the property loss. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=571.44s)]
*  35 blocks were systematically looted and burned. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=576.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. Does it say why they did this? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm guessing it's not fireworks. Yeah, this looks more like probably racism. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=587.6s)]
*  Mobs of white residents. The Red Cross provided relief. Do you see any, if you see something, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=592.48s)]
*  Zach, let me know. Won't you peep on it while we're, but that's what kind of my head is. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=600.64s)]
*  I remember going to the doctor one time when I was young and the guy, they put that thing in your [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=606.24s)]
*  head, that little looker, you know? The looker? Oh, the ear looker? Yeah. Stethoscope. It's called [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=611.52s)]
*  an ear looker. Stethoscope, yeah. Ear looker. Yeah, ear looker. Yeah, I got it. I know, yeah, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  stethoscope. They put it in there and the guy was like, oh, you got a bunch of brothers in your head, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=623.52s)]
*  but he said the N word, right? The doctor. What? Yeah. And I remember that and I was like, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=629.52s)]
*  and he was just joking around, I guess, you know? But it was like, I didn't know what was going on. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=635.92s)]
*  How old were you? I was probably nine or 10, you know? Just think of that, dude. Imagine being that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=640.88s)]
*  doctor looking in a kid's ear and that is what makes sense for you to say. Yeah, and that's a [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=647.12s)]

*  the placenta or bury it. Do you want to? I have a picture of a placenta if you want to see it. I [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1355.92s)]
*  would love to. It's kind of strong though. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Wow. And is that cooked or not cooked? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1361.04s)]
*  Bring it back up. That look like raw placenta. That's raw. Yeah, that's probably chef Anthony [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1367.3600000000001s)]
*  Bourdain's kitchen or a cooking show or something. Oh yeah. This looks like a little bit. Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1373.28s)]

*  You're right. I've heard that in LA, like women save the placenta and literally put it in like [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1386.88s)]
*  smoothies like down, like people are, they'll like incorporate it into daily eating. Well, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1390.48s)]
*  there's a new purse too. I think they're doing a purse now. You know, the purse is beautiful. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1394.88s)]
*  Gucci has a wonderful placenta purse for the season, a summer placenta purse, but the, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1399.76s)]
*  the pro, here's what's happened. What happens and it's a real problem is that people bury their [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1405.04s)]
*  placenta and they have a little ceremony for it, but they don't bury it deep enough and their dogs [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1410.16s)]
*  stick it up. So you're like, you're like sitting down to watch TV and you look and like, there's [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1415.52s)]
*  like half of eating placenta on your couch. So you got to put it in a box or bury it deep because [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1421.52s)]
*  dogs just love placenta. Who? Yeah. I can't even, it's everything. Yeah. It's everything a dog would [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1429.8400000000001s)]
*  want. It has blood in it. It's like from the crotch area, you know, it's like dogs love all that. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1436.0s)]
*  Oh my God. It's, yes, it's literally a dog's dream food. Yeah. For sure. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1442.24s)]
*  I, yeah, I do think it is kind of fascinating though, that we don't have a, like, are we missing [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1449.44s)]
*  levels of ourselves in basic scans and information that like, how close are we to be able to [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1458.88s)]
*  do a scan, an MRI that tells us what's going on with ourselves at some different levels? Like [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1465.92s)]
*  an emotional CAT scan. Yeah. Emotional seems to be the level that seems to be a lot of the realm [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1473.2s)]
*  that we're really missing. I feel like when it comes to like diagnoses. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1479.28s)]
*  for sure. Because I mean, all the psychologists has to go on is what the patient is telling them, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1488.96s)]
*  right? Or that's it. You can't do anything other than that. Or like past behaviors, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1494.48s)]
*  or you know, but still you don't know. Yeah. I mean, this is to me the astounding part of being [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1500.24s)]
*  human is we're choosing to behave the way we do. Like, many times I would like to think, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't really have a choice there. Like that just was a reaction to an event that spontaneously [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1514.32s)]
*  erupted out of me. But if you kind of mindfully study your worst moments, most of the time you'll [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1520.32s)]
*  realize there was like a micro moment where you decided to like do your defense mechanism that [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1528.96s)]
*  always hurts people's feelings or gives you a feeling later of guilt or something. There's [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1536.08s)]
*  this weird microsecond where you decide to do it. Like your brain is some kind of computer, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1542.72s)]
*  and it's spit. It's like choose your own adventure. And it spits out a few options, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1548.56s)]
*  and you pick the most annoying, aggressive, shitty one. Yes, I do. You chose to do it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1553.2s)]
*  You know, you weren't possessed. Right. But the choice happens so quick that you could easily [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1559.04s)]
*  miss the choice. That's what's cool about it is you don't have to be the way you are at all. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1564.0s)]
*  Change your clothes, change your haircut, get a face tattoo, whatever you want. You could do [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1568.3999999999999s)]
*  whatever you want, but we're addicted to being us. You know, it's so habitual. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1574.24s)]
*  Wow. You know, and it's one thing I noticed with doing meditation, right, that starts to help me [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1578.64s)]
*  is I'm not just like in the carriage of the roller coaster I'm on. I'm not just because usually I'm so [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1584.16s)]
*  attached to my own life. I'm like, oh, this is what. But if I do some meditation, even for a [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1594.4s)]
*  couple of weeks, I'm start to have a little bit more separation from me and what I'm doing. So I'm [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1599.36s)]
*  like, oh, I do have a little bit more choice. I can see a little bit more how I'm behaving instead [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1606.8799999999999s)]
*  of just behaving. Like if you're always upset, if you're always anything, or if you're feel like you [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1615.12s)]
*  are just constantly in response to some choices that you're making and you're like, fuck, I don't [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1622.24s)]
*  know what's going on. Meditation has always given me a little bit of a step backwards. Like, oh, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1629.28s)]
*  I'm not always just the guy sitting in the in the roller coaster car about to go on the ride. Now, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1635.6s)]
*  sometimes I'm the person waiting by the side of it. Like I'm the conductor a little. Yeah. It's [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1642.48s)]
*  like, oh, interesting. God roller coaster is a great way to describe it, man. There's a lot of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1646.8799999999999s)]
*  antiquated ways of describing it. A chariot attached to like the most powerful horses. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  If you can't control them, you're going to get dragged. Wild elephant, wild elephant. But you [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1660.1599999999999s)]
*  know, that's a, you know, this is an Eastern, you have to grow up in India to even know like what [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1665.1999999999998s)]
*  that means. I mean, I've seen videos of wild elephants. They're not great. Yeah. The roller [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1670.0s)]
*  coaster. That's fucking awesome, man. Roller coaster. That's the new description of the. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1673.52s)]
*  Smooth operator. Yeah. Roller coaster. Yeah. But just not being so attached to myself. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1678.96s)]
*  I will say that that's the only time I'm able to get any insight into like, wow, look at my [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1685.28s)]
*  behaviors. Look at what's going on instead of just being my behaviors. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1690.16s)]
*  and you know, something that's really wonderful is if you, it's not like you have that pause that [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1695.04s)]
*  seems to expand with meditation. So you have a little more time to decide what you're going to do. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1702.0s)]
*  You, it doesn't mean you're going to choose the well behaved thing to do. It just means if you do [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1707.2s)]
*  choose to be an asshole, you know, you did on purpose. You thought about it and you're like, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1714.48s)]
*  I'm going to be a fucking asshole here. I'm deciding instead of spontaneously just going [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1720.08s)]
*  asshole mode. Right. That's it. That's what meditation provides. It provides you the ability [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1725.36s)]
*  or the notice ability to go from spontaneously being an asshole to choosing to say, I'm going [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1730.64s)]
*  to be an asshole. What a gift. What a gift. No, you know, one thing I don't know, because I haven't [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1738.72s)]
*  read this, someone who's friends with him told me that once Yird Ram Dass, the spiritual teacher say, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1747.36s)]
*  if an, if an asshole gets enlightened, then they're going to be an enlightened asshole. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1752.48s)]
*  This whole notion that you start meditating or take up the spiritual path and like now, like, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1760.0s)]
*  I don't know, you're making like Instagram videos in front of like crystal pools of water and, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1765.68s)]
*  and beautiful forests with your beads and you're like emanating light. That is not the case. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1772.0s)]
*  It just, you just, like you're saying, you become the roller coaster conductor. At least you know [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1778.72s)]
*  that you are simultaneously controlling the ride and getting on the ride. Yes. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1784.56s)]
*  There's some freedom in that, I think. Well, it's interesting because then you start to see, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1790.08s)]
*  oh, well, what else could be going on in the depths of me when I'm not just sitting here [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1795.36s)]
*  in the same, like at the beach of myself, I'm not just, you know, it's like, I feel like that's one [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1801.76s)]
*  of the first steps in this sort of getting into like, realizing there's more to you than just [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1808.08s)]
*  being this reactive substance described as like a human. Reactive substance. Is that what the [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1814.96s)]
*  aliens call us? That's probably what they thought it was at first. They're just like, there's these [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1823.4399999999998s)]
*  react. There's a bunch of reactive substance on that planet. Yeah. We don't know what it is. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1827.76s)]
*  Sometimes it like gets into vehicles. We think it's vehicles. Yeah. Yeah. Once sometimes a doctor [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1832.96s)]
*  tells one of them, one of them tells them they have black guys in their head as a child. Yeah, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1839.04s)]
*  I know. Well, you know, I did, like, I did read that maybe that is the reason, even though these [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1843.44s)]
*  days, I guess you can't say we're not getting visited. But one of the theories on why aliens [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  are coming here is because they don't consider us intelligent life. Yeah. So they just see us as [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  just like what you're saying, some kind of like vaguely sentient reactive meat and not worth [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1859.0400000000002s)]
*  visiting. I think that makes sense. I mean, I've long thought the reason why I think aliens used [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1865.3600000000001s)]
*  to come a lot probably back in the day. Right. They came a lot. That's why you saw a lot of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1869.7600000000002s)]
*  Egyptians drawing them. Yeah. You know, and, and even the fact that they would stay stable long [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1874.64s)]
*  enough for an Egyptian to draw them, because in Egypt, you know, like they had to get a candle, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1880.72s)]
*  they had to light it, they had to get the guy who could draw. Like it was a little bit more of [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1885.84s)]
*  than just. Chiseling. Yeah. Sometimes chiseling. Yeah. It was more than just us grabbing a phone. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1890.24s)]
*  Right. Yeah. But I think, yeah, they used to come by a lot and then they realized it's kind of boring. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  We've become like one of the boring theme parks in the galaxy. So if your parents, if your alien [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1900.8799999999999s)]
*  parents take you to the earth for your graduation, I bet the other aliens are like, what a fucking [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1905.76s)]
*  loser to your parents. Nobody's been there in forever, dude. How poor are you guys? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1911.92s)]
*  It's like a six flags knockoff. Yes. Like one of those shitty, like shitty theme parks where [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1918.16s)]
*  they're, they don't even try to clean up the puke. Yeah. There's just puke splattered everywhere. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1924.88s)]
*  You'll probably get like pickpocketed. You look at the kids controlling the roller coaster and [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1929.28s)]
*  they're like clearly on PCP. They're not paying attention. Your people die. You know, people die [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1935.04s)]
*  there. But yeah, yeah. Yeah. One of the guys running the rides is in a coma, but they have to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1941.2s)]
*  hire like the government. You have to hire more comatose people. Yeah. It's just like, yeah, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1946.24s)]
*  the guy's like, just like has his morphine button and his fucking start the ride button confused. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1951.52s)]
*  Crazy. I mean, any theme park. I mean, that is really like, to me, the more terrifying than the [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1957.92s)]
*  roller coaster itself is when you look at the person controlling the roller coaster and then [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1964.4s)]
*  imagine like, what if that person was controlling subways in New York? Would you feel okay about [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1968.56s)]
*  that? But the roller coaster is probably more dangerous than the subway. It's like it shouldn't [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1973.36s)]
*  even work. It's like using weird physics. They hired a roller coaster architect. They could afford [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1978.56s)]
*  them for a couple of weeks through something together. And then they just let like a 17 year [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1985.6s)]
*  old on like synthetic marijuana for sure. Oh yeah. Control that fucking thing. Yeah. And then he [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=1991.04s)]
*  spends, he, that kid, he lobbies to get a DJ there at the same time, like for the ride, right? Like [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  they're like, we could spend more money on safety. And he's like, no way, dude, we need my boy Ricky [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2009.28s)]
*  right here to spin his tables on the side. That's right. And you know, they know they have insurance. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2014.32s)]
*  So they're just like, look, I'm paying a shit ton of money for roller coaster insurance. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2019.36s)]

*  between a lot of people would drive from like the main thoroughfare in town and then they would go [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2344.64s)]
*  through our neighborhood, which was pretty dumpy and go on to like kind of wealthier areas. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2348.8s)]
*  And we were right outside of the city limits or the town limits. I think we lived in a town, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2355.28s)]
*  but a lot of people would just throw shit out. And once they got outside of the city limits, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2359.68s)]
*  because there wasn't like a, you couldn't get a fine for it. So a lot of, there was a [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2366.08s)]

*  the people who are euthanizing their animals, they're saying to them, don't worry, we're going [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2404.32s)]
*  to cremate these bodies and we're going to give you the ashes. Yeah. So what they have is probably [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2408.6400000000003s)]
*  just a pile of ash because it's probably expensive to run a cremation service for animals. Oh yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2414.64s)]
*  So you're, they're sending fake ash to the like grieving dog owners or barbecue ash, something [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2421.3599999999997s)]

*  cool stuff like that. But yeah, after a while, my mama gets so pissed because the yard would always [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2450.64s)]
*  smell like dead animals. You know, so we had this abundance of like dead animal smell, which is a, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2455.04s)]

*  Probably, I would say three years probably. Maybe. And the summer I think was the worst because of [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2527.28s)]
*  the smell. And it would kind of happen in shifts. It wouldn't be like every day they would throw [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2533.6800000000003s)]
*  stuff out there, you know? There'd be kind of a time of the month or whatever. I don't want to [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2537.0400000000004s)]

*  Okay, I gotcha. So I think because it was just right outside of city limits, you know? And I think [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2556.72s)]
*  they probably lived in like some of the nicer areas. So they, it was kind of this pass through [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2561.2799999999997s)]
*  McGee Street over there in Covington, Louisiana. And people just, they'd throw all kind of stuff [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2566.48s)]

*  weird way about having like animal carcasses in a ditch. Like that is interesting. There's something [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2622.0800000000004s)]
*  cool about that. Yeah, it was interesting. But it's going to get old. That's all. Yeah. And the waft of it was bad. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2626.6400000000003s)]
*  That was the worst part. And I think my mom hated that. She hated, you know, leaving us there and [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2631.6000000000004s)]
*  being under the waft of those animals probably. You know, because it just haunts everything. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2636.08s)]

*  like more sightings or whatever. What is this? Yeah, this is actually pretty topical. NASA just [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2681.76s)]
*  held like a four hour press conference about UFOs for the first time. And they're basically [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2686.4s)]
*  admitting that it's a daily occurrence at this point. UFOs. There actually there's one thing that's [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2690.24s)]
*  happened since this weirdly boring NASA press conference where they did say this. Did you see [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2694.8799999999997s)]
*  the thing? There's now a whistleblower who has come forward and said that the United States has [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2700.56s)]
*  alien spaceship wreckage and a congressman, I can't remember his name, gave a statement to the press [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2708.64s)]
*  saying they were debriefed that in fact we have alien wreckage that they're about to have hearings [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2716.0s)]
*  on it. So all the UFO people are. Yeah, that's it. The we're definitely not alone thing. People are [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2724.32s)]
*  really freaking out right now because, you know, this is what all the UFO people have been saying [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2729.12s)]
*  is coming. Disclosure. So yeah, it's that guy. A whistleblower says he handed over classified evidence [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2733.28s)]
*  proving that a secret government program has been recovering spaceships and aliens for decades. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2741.04s)]
*  We're definitely not alone. David Grush says he's a former intelligence and military official. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2746.96s)]
*  Representative Republican Dean Phillips, a representative Dean Phillips from Minnesota, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2762.4s)]
*  Democrat, added, my first reaction is probably like everybody watching this, which is wow. And [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2768.56s)]
*  secondly, I'll believe it when I see it. I mean, that's fair. You're not supposed to immediately [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2772.16s)]
*  believe UFO. Oh, no. But what's interesting about this is that the denial that usually happens when [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2778.0s)]
*  things like someone says it's not really happening in the same way. And again, there was a congressman [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2787.04s)]
*  who said we were debriefed. Like, did you ever see that? So like, they did hearings on UAPs a [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2793.6s)]
*  while ago. And then after the hearing, they debriefed the feds, the congress, they debriefed [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2799.44s)]
*  them. And they did an interview with one of these representatives in the hallway after he just got [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2807.84s)]
*  told whatever the fuck they told him. And he said, you can find on YouTube, he said something along [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2813.76s)]
*  the lines of lock your doors and windows tonight, folks. That was his response. Like whatever they [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2818.96s)]
*  told him, inspired him to say we should lock our doors. Like, let's keep an alien out. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2824.48s)]
*  Lock your doors after classified hearing on UFOs. A Louisiana senator. Now we're talking. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2833.28s)]
*  Yeah, man. This is the same state that couldn't keep brothers outside of my head when I was a kid. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2838.56s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you, you could like, this is nuts. You can watch. Are you allowed to show [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2844.96s)]
*  YouTube videos on here? There's a clip of him doing it. It's hilarious. Is this him right here [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2849.44s)]
*  doing it? Oh, yeah, that's it flying objects that a couple of weeks ago, our skies were clear. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2853.44s)]
*  And then all of a sudden we have spy balloons and other identify unidentified flying objects [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2860.64s)]
*  raining down on us like confetti. That is not accurate. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2868.64s)]
*  Um, these objects have been flying over us for years, many years. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2874.56s)]
*  We've known about those objects for many years. We're not sure that we've known about all of them, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2885.92s)]
*  but we've known about many of them. Except for the Chinese spy balloon. We don't know what they are. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2894.4s)]
*  What's different about the last two weeks is that we've started shooting them down, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2904.24s)]
*  but we can't find the remnants except for the the the spy balloon. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2911.8399999999997s)]
*  And that's what I took away from the hearing today. So I don't know if he paid attention during the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  whole hearing. No confetti raining down like confetti. It's a great descriptor. Um, yeah, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  that's what I don't, yeah, I think. But maybe I could see if there's an alien life form, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2930.72s)]
*  you shoot it, you whatever, and it dissipates. Part of the way it's constructed is not to fall [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2938.3999999999996s)]
*  down to this. That would be the first thing I would make of something that can't leave evidence. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2946.16s)]
*  Right, like exactly. But like based on the stuff that's coming out right now, and you know, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2950.56s)]
*  I love UFOs in the same way I love like stories about magic and miracles. And I, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2956.96s)]
*  but I don't go full bore into it because ultimately, like day to day reality isn't impacted, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2962.7200000000003s)]
*  like, you know, mundane reality, right, taking care of the kids, paying the mortgage. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2970.96s)]
*  So you can get too distracted by that stuff and spin out. But this moment in United States [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2976.2400000000002s)]
*  history is really fascinating in the sense that if we go back to Roswell, it was a weather balloon. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2983.36s)]
*  That's what they say. Even though there's like many accounts of people saying that they saw [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2988.96s)]
*  aliens, there was weird wreckage that seemed to be able to like you could bend it out of shape, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=2993.76s)]
*  and it would go back into the form it was just like weird shit. Right. This gets denied by the [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3001.2000000000003s)]
*  government. It was wreckage, weird stories about it, whatever. We get area 51. You know what I mean? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3007.76s)]
*  It has its own airplane that flies people in. You get a variety of like early phase government [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3013.68s)]
*  whistleblowers like Lazar, I think is his name. Alan Lazar? Bob Lazar. Bob Lazar, yeah. Bob Lazar. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3020.56s)]
*  You get like that and then these people get creamed in the media. It's like that's a lunatic. He never [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3028.3199999999997s)]
*  worked to area 51. This is bullshit. He's like a con artist, whatever. But now what's happening is [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3035.4399999999996s)]
*  instead of the denial that generally follows the whistleblowers admission of us like having some [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3042.08s)]
*  connection to aliens, it's not getting denied as much anymore. And in fact, this whistleblower [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3047.84s)]
*  program they just created makes it so anyone who signed an NDA, who's a private contractor [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3054.16s)]
*  and has been assigned to work on alien wreckage can now come forward and say, I worked on this shit [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3059.52s)]
*  and they get full immunity because that apparently was the back door. Like you, so there was these [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3065.76s)]
*  programs you could hire like, I don't know, name any like Raytheon. I don't know for sure. I don't [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3072.32s)]
*  know if they have wreckage. I'm just throwing out like a defense contract. Right, yeah. Raytheon. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3077.1200000000003s)]
*  Hire Raytheon. Duracell. Hire Duracell. Say look, we've got this ship. It crashed. Can you guys hang [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3080.7200000000003s)]
*  on to it? Try to reverse engineer it. And so now a private contractor has collected the wreckage, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3087.6000000000004s)]
*  has the wreckage, meaning if you're asked under oath, do we have wreckage? You could say no. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3093.36s)]
*  Because we don't. A private contractor has the wreckage. That was the loophole. So now they set [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3099.6s)]
*  up this whistleblower program and all these people like that guy are starting to come out. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3105.28s)]
*  People who just like worked at Hyundai or I don't know, worked at like Dodge Neon. Dodge Neon. And [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3110.0s)]
*  they were like, hey, can you reverse engineer this thing that seems to be bending the time space [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3115.92s)]
*  continuum? And they're like, no, but they couldn't say anything about it because they signed these [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3120.56s)]
*  hardcore NDAs. So now they're all leaking the data. So we're getting this weird, slow leak from all [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3125.44s)]
*  these people that's painting a picture. And that's a real program that they allow now. How did that [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3132.48s)]
*  program get created, the whistleblower program? So what was happening was, well, the biggest [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3137.12s)]
*  problem is like people, apparently people get around these things and everyone listening, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3143.2s)]
*  you can look all this up. It's like all it's, I've got the documents. It's real. Like it's not like [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3148.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm just, it's real. You can find all this stuff, but the biggest problem is you're a Navy pilot. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3155.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And you see something that is not functioning according to your understanding. Not kosher, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3161.2s)]
*  seems odd. It's going so fast. It's stopping. It's just stopping like it's a cursor on a computer [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3167.7599999999998s)]
*  screen. Then it's going the opposite direction. It's jamming your radar. It doesn't seem to have [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3175.12s)]
*  windows. Right? So you see that and your choices are, do I say I saw what is obviously a UFO? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3180.16s)]
*  And if you do, you could really like fuck your career up. So you couldn't talk about it. The [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3187.6s)]
*  other problem is that apparently people who get too close to these things, they have, there's a [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3192.3199999999997s)]
*  physiological impact. So let's imagine you got close to one of these things and now you're sick. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3197.3599999999997s)]
*  The VA won't pay for it because there are no UFOs. What are you talking about? And so [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3203.28s)]
*  inadvertently, you end up creating a situation where people won't say what they're seeing up in [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3209.2000000000003s)]
*  the sky, which isn't great if you're trying to defend the sky. We want to know what's out there. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3213.92s)]
*  You want to know everything that's flying through us airspace. Right? So yeah, the whistleblower [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3218.8s)]
*  program was, I think initially to kind of create a safe way, a safe haven where people could say, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3223.44s)]
*  okay, this is what I saw. I don't want to endanger myself. I don't want to endanger [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3230.48s)]
*  not being able to get medical care and things like that. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. And then, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3235.12s)]
*  and now it's sort of like, now that it's working, it's, you know, all you need is like one person [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3241.6s)]
*  to come forward. It's like me too for aliens. Just one person, then the next person, then the [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3249.36s)]
*  next person, then the next person. You know, that's what's happening. All these people who've [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3255.84s)]
*  kept this shit like completely, I'm sure bottled up. Imagine the people that have molested people [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3261.44s)]
*  or something just because they saw an alien and they didn't know how to process or when insane or [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3267.52s)]
*  like, you know, like, like, uh, so many things. Yeah. Beat their spouse or just imagine a guy. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3272.4s)]
*  He, he saw something in his whole life. He's been hiding things from like taking anything. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3279.28s)]
*  He in hiding, you know, like just weird, there's weird ways that people react to things that are [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3285.36s)]
*  seen beyond them. Yeah. You know, it eats you alive and then add to it that apparently these people [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3290.0s)]
*  have been threatened with death, that whoever's running this shit is not fucking around. They, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3295.76s)]
*  they don't want the general populace. They don't want the world to know that this has happened [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3301.92s)]
*  because apparently, and again, this is just conjecture here. Obviously from a military [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3307.84s)]
*  perspective, if you figure out how those things can fly and you build a fleet of them, you, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3313.52s)]
*  it's like the new atom bomb. Like you are, have complete superiority in the sky. And like, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3320.24s)]
*  if we're, you're living in the United States right now, you want us to be the ones who want to be [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3326.88s)]
*  first. You don't want some other country who they apparently all have this shit to like win this race. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3331.36s)]
*  But what about Mexico, dog? You know, they don't have the fucking strongest. They're like, dog, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3338.88s)]
*  these motherfuckers, dog. That'd be incredible if all of a sudden they have the most advanced [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3343.44s)]
*  Air Force. Some guy just comes up with the fucking, and bro, it's the lowest riding UFO ever. Like [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3348.0s)]
*  the UFO is only like two inches off the ground. Like dog, this bitch is fucking, it goes, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3356.1600000000003s)]
*  it goes too high, dog. We don't, this bitch goes too fucking high. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3362.8799999999997s)]
*  Dude, it would be, you're right. It would be interesting. Like whoever gets it is going to [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3370.72s)]
*  be fucking cool. We should have a show where every country brings their, it brings their latest, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3374.24s)]
*  like a UFO aircraft that they made, bro. Amazing. That would be the best show. Skin care. You know, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3379.2s)]
*  a lot of females do it. You see a female in God, their skin just looks like somebody just [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3387.04s)]
*  damn cared about it. Like, man, is your skin, what's your skin? How much people care about your skin? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3392.72s)]
*  Well, men often can't find the right brand or simply lack knowledge and understanding of skin [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3401.12s)]

*  that you get to live in a time period in American history where the federal government seems to [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3606.6400000000003s)]
*  no longer be denying the thing that people have been saying forever. But here's my question. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3612.6400000000003s)]
*  That would be what's in it for the federal government that they would now not deny it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3619.04s)]
*  Well, I think that's one of the most important questions regarding this situation is [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3624.5600000000004s)]
*  why? Why suddenly are they kind of slow leaking this information? Like I don't know the answer [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3630.96s)]
*  to that. Like I have no idea. Like, well, some things could be, I mean, just off the top of my [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3639.28s)]
*  head is if they want us to believe in some sort of universal protector, then that will come along. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3643.28s)]
*  Right. Like some things, some organizations, some like insurance against aliens in a way, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3651.6000000000004s)]
*  not an actual like you pay 40 bucks a month, but like, right, like as in creating some new world [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3659.28s)]
*  or, you know, if there's that part of that regime that like, you know, this, this one world order [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3665.28s)]
*  type of thing, if they, you know, I'm just trying to think of the upside. What does somebody gain? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3671.36s)]
*  Do we need a new enemy? Are they realizing that like religion isn't working enough on people [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3677.76s)]
*  anymore or the fear of there's not enough fear imposed on people at them? You know, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3683.52s)]
*  I don't know. Or it could just be that that's blue beam. You're talking about blue beam. That's the [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3689.36s)]
*  big conspiracy theory. That's like essentially like there's two possibilities. The one you just said, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3694.08s)]
*  which I guess if you're going to do like Occam's razor, that is the most likely one, right? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3699.68s)]
*  What is Occam's razor? The simplest solution is generally the solution. So in this case, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  it's more likely this is a human operation than aliens based on our understanding of physics and [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3712.32s)]
*  the distance of habitable galaxies where there are planets in the Goldilocks region, the amount of [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3718.88s)]
*  time it would take to get here based on what we understand about how fast you can go. Probably, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3725.6s)]
*  if you're going to, if you're going to bet, bet it's not an alien, right? In Vegas, if you're betting, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3731.84s)]
*  you're probably, you should always bet that's not an alien. That's a human thing. You're going to [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3737.52s)]
*  win most of the time. So that is one of the possibilities. It's very sinister. The idea [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3741.84s)]
*  being there's some social control benefit related to tricking the population of the planet into [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3748.88s)]
*  thinking there's aliens. That's probably not the Occam's razor of it then. I mean, the other side [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3756.88s)]
*  of it is, well, we live on a planet that's been being visited by a variety of alien species that [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3763.2s)]
*  more than likely genetically engineered us a long time ago and like shifted us from proto-hominids [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3771.6s)]
*  into what we are now. Probably for a reason that we're not going to like. Like they like were [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3777.2799999999997s)]
*  Roombas or something. I mean, that's one of the theories is they just wanted gold. So they [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3783.52s)]
*  genetically engineered us to like gold. So we naturally mine fucking gold for them because we [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3788.16s)]
*  like shiny shit. We like gold and that they use it as some kind of fuel. Oh yeah. Have you seen [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3794.48s)]
*  basketball wives, dude? No. That the whole show's about gold. Right. They love gold. It's crazy. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3799.2s)]
*  It's like, what are we even doing here? Right. It doesn't make sense. Like why do you like [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3805.6s)]
*  this shiny, stupid, heavy fucking metal? Why are you into that so much? There's so many other [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3810.48s)]
*  cooler metals out there, but gold obsession is a real thing. So the theory is these Anunnaki [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3815.76s)]
*  programmed us to like gold because they need it for their spaceships. They didn't give a shit about [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3821.84s)]
*  us. They're just like, do the- We'll just farm some gold here. That's it. Brilliant from that perspective. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3826.2400000000002s)]
*  So that to me is a far more complex and weird explanation than just the military industrial complex [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3831.84s)]
*  has like networked with other governments and they're like, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3841.52s)]
*  I think they're at the point. They're so fucking dumb. They're going to believe there's aliens [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3845.36s)]
*  and like we can manipulate them. That's what it seems like. That's what it would seem like to me [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3849.92s)]
*  because I don't know, unless it there, they're like, we're getting to the point where so many [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3854.88s)]
*  people are being like, there's so much evidence. The more you make me think this is not real, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3862.0s)]
*  the more I'm just thinking you are not honest. Like at a certain point, the residual effect of [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3868.24s)]
*  the magic trick isn't, it doesn't cause the beautiful deception anymore. It causes you to [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3876.7999999999997s)]
*  hate the magician. Exactly. Exactly. So that's the thing that's weird, bros. Like, you know, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3884.8799999999997s)]
*  why? Why? And look, I would love to see it. Would I like to meet an alien? I don't know, dude. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3893.36s)]
*  You would. Give me a break. You know, just from our few podcasts together and conversations, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3901.6800000000003s)]
*  we had, I don't, I wouldn't you like it? Of course you'd like to meet an alien. It'd be the [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3907.2000000000003s)]
*  coolest thing ever. Don't you want to know what they smell like? No one ever talks about that. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3911.52s)]
*  What do they smell like? What is the, what does a gray alien's head smell like? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3916.48s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. Is it bitter? Is it a stinky smell? Is it fishy? Oh, if they're fishy, dude, I'm out. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3920.8799999999997s)]
*  Bro, how much would this smell of aliens depend on how much we give a fuck about it anymore? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  Huge, bro. If they smell anything like a Korean pet store, dude, I'm fucking gone. Dude, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3937.68s)]
*  close encounters of the third kind. Spoiler, if you haven't seen it, I'm going to spoil it. Very in, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3945.52s)]
*  the guy who's been building the mud mountains happily walks into the spaceship, the beautiful [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3950.08s)]
*  musical spaceship. Imagine the fucking thing closes and you catch that first waft of deep, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3955.68s)]
*  like fish laying out in the beach smell as you're like light speed heading away from the planet. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3963.52s)]
*  That's going to be what you smell forever. As you look out at the vastness of space, black holes, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3970.7999999999997s)]
*  all the beauty of space. All you can think about is there's just this stink rotting eggs and fucking [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3977.68s)]
*  fish. Bro, we would hate them aliens. Immediately we would hate them. Like these stinky motherfuckers. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3984.16s)]
*  Smell so bad and they refuse to like take showers. They're like, no, we don't do that. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=3994.48s)]
*  Yeah. No, we'll evaporate you before we'll take a fucking shower. No, we're the advanced intelligence. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4000.56s)]
*  You're supposed to stink. They're like, no, this is one of the many things we figured out. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4007.7599999999998s)]
*  If you don't stink, you haven't evolved. Like we go, we used to not stink. And then we learned, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4012.08s)]
*  we learned this is our purpose here to emit foul odors. Dude, I wonder also [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4018.32s)]
*  the odors that we closet so much now, right? Like from shaving, washing and all the things that we do [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4024.64s)]
*  and use in ointments. How much of that we're like taking out of like how much other stuff would I [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4033.9199999999996s)]
*  gather about you if you came in with two, say 80 days, a hot smell on you, 80 days of fresh Duncan on [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4041.04s)]
*  you. Post-burning man Duncan. Yeah. You come fucking rolling in. You've been hugging your kid. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4050.24s)]
*  You've been with your wife. You worked a couple of long weeks, right? You fucking been on seven [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4056.24s)]
*  flights. Like, but you get the full, like, I wonder how much are we killing off like some of that to [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4061.2799999999997s)]
*  go back to that, like scan of people, like how much of that was in our brains that we knew how to scan, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4067.7599999999998s)]
*  that we were be able, that we were create, able to gather more. Right. Like what if we were the [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4073.68s)]
*  aliens that initially, I got you, and we've dumbed ourselves, we've, we've killed off all of those [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4079.04s)]
*  things. I got you. Yeah, man. I got you. It's like, uh, the, the, there's this, I heard of this study [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4085.84s)]
*  where they took, and I don't know how they did this and, um, I'm not a scientist and honestly, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4091.7599999999998s)]
*  when I hear about studies, maybe one out of a hundred, I try to actually read the study. And [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4096.88s)]
*  then when I do try, I realize how dumb I am. I'm like, I don't understand statistics, but so all [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4101.84s)]
*  that being said, apparently it is study. They found like good genetic matches for, uh, women. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4107.04s)]
*  And they, like, based on their genetics and this person's genetics, somehow this is like, they would [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4114.32s)]
*  theoretically make a great baby. So they take these dudes shirts, put them in Ziploc bags, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4119.6s)]
*  and they let the women, uh, just smell the shirts. So the women are like smelling like, you know, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4128.16s)]

*  Uh, guiding energy is based on the idea that we all have an unseen life force energy that flows [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4559.36s)]
*  through our bodies. According to the international center for Reiki training, a Reiki practitioner [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4567.28s)]
*  gently moves her hands. So it seems to be, and I've seen this as well. I've only been offered Reiki [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4572.719999999999s)]

*  when you're in it, it's good. And also that particular one has this weird heft to it that I [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4634.96s)]
*  like. Yeah, it feels sturdy or kind of like a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Yeah, like a carpenter's vape. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4640.16s)]
*  It's like a industrial vape. Keep it on the belt. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4646.96s)]
*  Energy blockage, man. That does it to me. Yes. This is like, this is what I don't want to get into [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4652.96s)]
*  vape lecturing anyone. Everyone's addicted to this shit right now. But the, like I'm [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4659.84s)]
*  listening to this great book. I think it's called Why We Meditate. It's so good. And basically the [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4664.64s)]
*  idea is many people, me included, are in a hurry, rushing around. And the reason we're in a hurry is [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4671.04s)]
*  because we have this speedy kind of energy in our chest. It's that feeling when you're like, fuck, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4680.72s)]
*  I gotta go. I gotta do this. That thing. You should have seen me when I rolled in here. I'm sorry, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4685.6s)]
*  Zach. I want to apologize again. Me too. I was, I know, I, you know, I was excited to do it, to see [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4689.68s)]
*  you. But also, fuck, I'm late. You're doing this weird speedy thing. Well, what's triggering that [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4694.88s)]
*  is energy that, you know, anyone who out there is anxious or feeling in a hurry or freaked out right [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4701.92s)]
*  now, you can just tune into it like easily. You just feel it. It's like a fast kind of buzzing sort [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4707.84s)]
*  of weird energy in your chest generally. It's hard to get rid of it. Well, that, right, well, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4716.16s)]
*  it's a block. So according to this book, that energy is supposed to be under your bellybutt, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4722.4s)]
*  not up in your chest. Like your energy's gotten all fucked up, but now it's all stuck in your chest. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4728.72s)]
*  And so like via like meditation, breathing exercises, you, the idea is over time, you sort [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4733.599999999999s)]
*  of retrain yourself to get that energy throughout your whole body. It's like, it's not supposed to [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4740.32s)]
*  be just here. Imagine if you could spread it out like nice peanut butter over your entire psychic [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4745.36s)]
*  body. That would be very powerful. It's just not supposed to be right. You're not supposed to be [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4752.4s)]
*  free-basing the anxiety. Yeah, I feel like that's the culture we're in now where we are free-basing [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4757.839999999999s)]
*  our own anxiety. Yeah, man, we have boiled it down to like just a granular, powerful rock. It's like [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4766.0s)]
*  fentanyl. We've done the same thing fentanyl did for heroin. We just figured out a way to just [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4773.44s)]
*  hyper accentuate our anxiety and coffee doesn't help. I mean, I was in Red Bull. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4779.599999999999s)]
*  Nothing else, man. It's already yawning here, but I think that was like my body saying, hey, man, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4785.5199999999995s)]
*  we're trying to slow it down. Do you feel overwhelmed? I'm sorry to cut you off. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4791.04s)]

*  and I think, I don't know if you asked me or not, and then I think the pandemic happened. I did. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4805.92s)]
*  And I think I said that there was a time where I was going through a space where I could barely [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4810.160000000001s)]
*  even talk to people at all. Oh my God. So, but let's get that done here. I don't know if you can [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4815.68s)]
*  do it over Zoom. If not, I'll... Zoom, mine's easy. It's all remote. You don't have to be anywhere [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4820.88s)]
*  at your convenience. You're busy, man. You're touring all the time. But I want to do it soon. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4825.6s)]
*  I want to do it in the next month or two so that we can... I want to bury that. That's been a [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4829.6s)]
*  little bit of a hatchet for me in my life. I know I brought it up. Well, I said I wanted to do it [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4834.08s)]
*  and never did it. Thank you. Theo, apology accepted. It's so fun just to spend time with you. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4838.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, same. That's what I'm realizing. I'm realizing I'm missing out sometimes on [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4844.8s)]
*  getting to spend time with people because I get so caught up in my own responsibilities. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4849.04s)]
*  Well, podcasts are friendship dates. Did you know that? That's what it is. It's a date for [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4852.8s)]
*  friendship. It's how I meet all my friends. Well, I just realized that the other day. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4856.24s)]
*  I went to do Rogan and I knew I was going to be in town for a bit, but he's so busy. I mean, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4859.12s)]
*  he's like... I can't even imagine how busy your responsibilities he has. He's also a father. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4864.639999999999s)]
*  You're a father. So I realized, man, I should have used that time with him on the show to be [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4870.719999999999s)]
*  our friendship time. And sometimes I think of those times more as like... I do think of it as... [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4877.36s)]
*  But I could have brought to him more questions I have about things where I could have used some [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4884.96s)]
*  guidance or some suggestions or... Sometimes I don't know why I sometimes don't do that. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4890.0s)]
*  And I think with Joe, we're still getting into each other some and his is such a big show. I [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4898.4800000000005s)]
*  think you are nervous as well, but... You know, that is like the abyss of that show is the moment [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4903.12s)]
*  you start thinking about how many people watch it. It's scary if you let your mind go there, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4910.08s)]
*  man. That is a... I really try not to do that before I do. It's so easy to think about that. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4916.8s)]
*  And then you're like, Jesus fucking Christ, this is like the top podcast on earth. But yours is [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4922.72s)]
*  like the second I saw we were scrolling through something. I don't know what it was, but I mean, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4929.12s)]
*  shit. We've been real fortunate, man. You know, we've been real fortunate. Well, you're funny too. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4934.48s)]
*  I mean, it's also you're super funny. I see your stuff pop up on my... My wife makes fun of me [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4939.76s)]
*  because I do Instagram reels instead of TikTok. And she thinks that's an old man thing too. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4944.72s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4950.72s)]
*  But your stuff pops up a lot. It's very funny. I love watching it. It always makes me laugh. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4951.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we got all kinds of neat stuff out there. Well, I think also you're such a unique thinker, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4956.8s)]
*  man. I think that we're going to need you more and more in the future. Are you feeling that? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4961.4400000000005s)]
*  Whatever gifts you were kind of given like... Because in the beginning, you were basically [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4967.92s)]
*  really just a comedian, right? Yeah. Was that your original goal? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4972.24s)]
*  Dude, I wish I could say I had an original goal. That's my problem. It's so... [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4975.68s)]
*  Malleable? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4981.360000000001s)]
*  Malleable, chaotic. And also, I really try as much as possible, not out of some... [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4982.16s)]
*  Not spiritual high road in here. But I, man, I try to stay in the present moment, not because of [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4989.4400000000005s)]
*  this is where you should be to find peace, but because, man, when I go too far up here, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=4998.16s)]
*  or I go into the future, or I go into the past, I just freak the fuck out. But if I'm here in the [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5002.88s)]
*  moment and just letting the moment happen, it's so wonderful. And then when I start thinking, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5009.04s)]
*  what the fuck am I? Am I a podcast or a comedian? Am I a voice actor? What the fuck am I? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5015.28s)]
*  I freak out because it's like, I have no idea. So it just seems easier to be like, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5023.28s)]
*  let's just grow with the punches and be who I am. Yeah. Right. And hope for the fucking best, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5028.08s)]
*  right? Because that's all you can really do. I mean, honestly, like, looking at the world right [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5032.88s)]
*  now, as it is, it's like, come on, like, are we really gonna have a next week? Right. You think [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5037.6s)]
*  we're gonna have a next month? I don't know. I mean, there's aliens on the front porch. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5044.56s)]
*  There's fucking... People are fighting. We don't even know who's really behind the fighting. There's [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5048.8s)]
*  like old war debts and like IOUs from companies that are like from Black Rock and Slumber J that [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5053.68s)]
*  probably still are milling around in the distance of invoices being sent to countries and people [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5062.16s)]
*  have died in wars that we don't even know if they were given the right reason they were fighting for. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5068.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, you mean the... This is the crazy thing about the Russia thing, man. These are conscripts. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5075.4400000000005s)]
*  Like everyone's self... What's a conscript? It means that you are drafted. And the real problem with [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5081.6s)]
*  all the people celebrating the death of Russian soldiers like they're fucking blow up dolls [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5087.6s)]
*  is that you... I get not liking a dictator, Putin, who fucking invaded Ukraine. Fuck you. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5094.16s)]
*  But you can't forget, and this is the paradox, a lot of those people on the front lines getting [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5101.04s)]
*  blown up by drones were political prisoners that got forced to go fight in a goddamn meat grinder [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5107.28s)]
*  by the dude who arrested them because they tried to get him out of office. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5115.84s)]
*  Wow. Imagine that. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5119.84s)]
*  You know what I mean, man? It's really sad. It's like these are... I mean, I don't know who's in [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5121.84s)]
*  jail in Russia. I imagine there's some really scary people in Russian jails who did horrible things, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5127.759999999999s)]
*  but I know for sure a lot of people in Russian jails are people who just protested [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5133.76s)]
*  the government. And those are the ones who are on the front fucking lines. So it's like, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5138.24s)]
*  you can't really celebrate the fact that some majority or some percentage of them were actually [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5142.96s)]
*  activists. Some percentage of them were just trying to make democracy happen in Russia, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5149.6s)]
*  and they got arrested. So yeah, man, exactly. World War III, by the way, I'm not trying to [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5155.92s)]
*  get all negative here. No, we're just looking at the landscape of things. I think most people [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5161.6s)]
*  are thinking that. But here right now, hanging out with you, talking, telling stories, and for [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5165.76s)]
*  most people, you know, this moment is so beautiful. Look how beautiful, even like in a podcast studio [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5172.96s)]
*  where there's like cameras and lights, just like how cool it is just to exist. There's color. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5179.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, existing is great, man. And you have to remember that, hey, at least I get to be here [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5186.160000000001s)]
*  for whatever this is. At least nature gave me a, like I've gotten to come to the edge of the [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5190.96s)]
*  fishbowl for a moment and whatever the existence of the universe is, and have open eyes and see [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5197.28s)]
*  something like, you know what I'm saying? Like it's all gonna fucking disappear. So it's like [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5204.32s)]
*  the fact that we're even getting to see a little bit of it or have feelings like love or [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5209.84s)]
*  um, jerking off or hugging somebody or eating some salmon or something. You're having some, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5215.360000000001s)]
*  you know, you're getting to have some unique moments or having a child and hugging your child [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5221.92s)]
*  and getting your child a chocolate or something, you know? It's nice, man. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5225.360000000001s)]
*  It's the best. And that, like the thing I've realized lately is the amount of anxiety or worry [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5230.64s)]
*  that I'm experiencing in the present moment, if I let myself worry about some future catastrophe, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5237.84s)]
*  is actually worse than if the catastrophe happened. You know what I'm talking about? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5245.04s)]
*  Like, totally. Like you imagine the thing you're most afraid of happening, whatever it may be, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5249.6s)]
*  and then think about how bad you feel as you worry over it versus the day after [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5254.4800000000005s)]
*  that rotten thing happens. So it's like you're worse off and it hasn't even happened than if [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5259.6s)]
*  it did happen. Yeah, you're already suffering an outcome that you don't even know if it's real or [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5266.8s)]
*  not. And nine out of ten times it's not as bad. Not as bad. Nine out of ten times, whatever it is. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5272.72s)]
*  I mean, obviously there's a few things that are going to be worse than feeling anxious, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5278.72s)]
*  getting like slowly eaten by a bear. Yeah. That's going to be worse than like whatever your emotional [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5282.96s)]
*  state is. But most things, pretty calm. And I probably death too, I imagine. I imagine death [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5289.52s)]
*  is like the ultimate version of like, fuck, I spent my whole life worrying about this. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5295.360000000001s)]
*  Right. This is real chill. This is great. Yeah. It's probably going through one of those turnstile [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5299.36s)]
*  things. Like it's a little wonky at first and you bump into it and you're like, oh, this thing [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5304.4s)]
*  doesn't even fucking open. Do I have the right thing? And then it opens. You're like, oh, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5308.4s)]
*  right. Here we are. Here we are again. This is where I always come and it's beautiful. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5312.96s)]
*  And my every single day I was like trying to protect myself from this. Oh, you know what? I'll [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5317.12s)]
*  do it again. And then you reincarnate again. And eventually maybe you figure it out. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5324.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you think everybody gets drafted for reincarnation? I don't think so. What do you mean? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5328.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think God redrafts? Does everybody get drafted for reincarnation? You like a parent, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5335.52s)]
*  like the model I like for reincarnation is that it is that you don't have to, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5341.36s)]
*  but you probably will. And that you've been doing it forever. Like the amount of time, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5350.32s)]
*  if you're a human, you've been incarnating so many times it's impossible to even imagine how [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5355.36s)]
*  long you've been reappearing. I don't know. Some people are brand new humans though. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5361.36s)]
*  You ever get that fresh out the box motherfucker like, yeah, this is your first lap on this pony, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5365.92s)]
*  homie. You know, he's like trying to get on the horse. He's like, I don't know what to do. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5373.28s)]
*  I've been a bumblebee for the last 6,000 incarnations. You want me to suddenly be [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5380.16s)]
*  a fucking human, drive a car? Yeah, man. Yeah. I think it's possible. He's just fucking driving [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5385.679999999999s)]
*  Uber and just hand eating, hand eating honey out of a jar the whole time. I was a fly. I was a slug [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5393.5199999999995s)]
*  and I'm a human now. That's it. Have patience. Those people should have a little sign on it [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5402.0s)]
*  says, look, this is the last seven things I was. So cut me a little bit of slack here. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5407.76s)]
*  Like, damn, this guy was a daddy long legs four times in a row. I was a bacteria and now he's [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5414.320000000001s)]
*  Luca Donchic. Jesus Christ, man. Have some support for the guy. Give him a break. Yeah, you're right. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5420.320000000001s)]
*  It's like, it's bullshit. It's like, there's all these old souls floating around, like acting like [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5430.88s)]
*  this human thing is easy, flowing with every moment and making it see. It's like, no, fuck you. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5435.92s)]
*  You're like the guy at the gym. You're like the guy at the gym with a six pack and the perfect [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5442.56s)]
*  fucking body who's been working out their whole life and that belt. And he has the weight just [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5447.04s)]
*  hanging off the belt the whole time. He's at the gym. What is that? What is that? That's crazy. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5451.76s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, I think this is why I love, even if it's not real, reincarnation [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5457.12s)]
*  is a method for self for being compassionate to yourself because it's like, you don't know what [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5462.32s)]
*  you were in your last lifetime. You want to talk about epigenetics affecting current behavior [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5467.44s)]
*  patterns. According to these ideas, your past lives and decisions you've made in your past lives [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5471.44s)]
*  are flowering right now and at the present moment. So when you're beating yourself up, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5476.48s)]
*  about this or that, it could be that really what you're experiencing is karma from the time you [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5481.84s)]
*  thought it would be funny to grab the baby out of the baby carriage and throw it in front of a truck [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5487.84s)]
*  or something in the early forties. You know what I mean? You don't know what the bad luck you're [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5492.64s)]
*  experiencing is necessarily originating from. Right. This could be, yeah, this could be some guy, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5499.280000000001s)]
*  a previous life. You're paying the debts of a previous existence. Exactly. So you just take [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5503.4400000000005s)]
*  it easy on yourself. Take it easy on yourself because it's, who knows? Well, it's hard to [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5509.6s)]
*  stomach. And I think though that if we lived still in tribal communities and stuff and there [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5513.68s)]
*  was a lot more connectivity between past lives and we honored who had died previously and this [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5518.0s)]
*  and that and we were still connected to them, I think then you would have more compassion from [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5523.200000000001s)]
*  your group. Like, oh, what you're dealing with now is what grandfather so-and-so did. And it's still [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5527.76s)]
*  making its way out of the DNA, back into nature. Yeah. Whitney's having that baby, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5534.8s)]
*  congratulations. Mazel tov, Whitney. That's great. That's great. It's so cool. It's the best. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5543.92s)]
*  Did you guys ever date you and Whitney? No, never did. Did you want it? I think maybe, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5549.280000000001s)]
*  you know, I wouldn't have minded maybe a date or something, probably. Yeah, of course. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5559.6s)]
*  I think there's something that happens as you get older. If you don't have a family, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5564.4800000000005s)]
*  when women start to get knocked up or when people start to sparse off, my best friend Scott just got [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5567.44s)]
*  engaged where you start thinking like, oh. Oh, shit. I know what you're talking about. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5574.24s)]
*  You're experiencing a version of what we're all going to experience in our 70s. My meditation [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5579.5199999999995s)]
*  teacher's teacher, Chogam Chumper Rinpoche said to him, when you get old, your friends start [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5585.36s)]
*  dying like flies, just dying. So now what you're experiencing is like pre-death. They're going into [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5590.719999999999s)]
*  a new life. They're being reincarnated as a parent. And you know, no matter what they're saying, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5596.64s)]
*  no matter how much comfort they may or may not be offering you regarding their presence in your life, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5604.0s)]
*  you know, it's just not, they're going to blink out of your reality for a little bit. It's going to [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5609.04s)]
*  change. Yeah. It's going to change. It has to. There, everything shifts, everything. And you, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5614.64s)]
*  there's just like no way around that. I mean, kids are a, it's a full-time experience. You [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5620.16s)]
*  want to hang out. Yeah. And you know what we experience, the breeders we experience, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5627.12s)]
*  our friends eventually being like, not asking us if we want to go get a drink anymore. Because they [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5633.2s)]
*  know, because every time they ask, fuck, got to get a babysitter. Oh, I can't, I'm doing this or that. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5638.96s)]
*  And then, so it sucks at that level, man. I mean, it takes extra discipline. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5644.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, man. You know what? You, maybe it's time to start seeking your life partner. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5649.44s)]
*  I think some of that is true too, you know, I think I had, well, when I went to, and I did [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5657.2s)]
*  IOWASC, I think it was probably maybe a year ago. Right. And so that was the first time that I [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5662.16s)]
*  started having to experience with like the younger me, like the child me, you know, and realizing [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5666.8s)]
*  that I just had never wanted to grow up because I never got to be the child I wanted to be. Right. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5672.32s)]
*  I had this, and I'm not like having self-pity. I'm not trying to just like, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5679.04s)]
*  but there was a lot of, I think I had held a huge grudge against the world. And then of just life, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5685.36s)]
*  the way things had played out that I hadn't gotten to have the childhood I wanted, you know, [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5694.799999999999s)]
*  and there wasn't enough lessons in it that helped me to easily adapt into the world. And so I, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5698.72s)]
*  but I didn't realize that until IOWASC, because then you're right there with your younger self, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5706.88s)]
*  you know? Yeah. And that was pretty crazy. Be like, oh, wow. You know, it's time for me to [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5710.64s)]
*  be an apparent, somebody at some point has to be a parent to this child inside of me. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5721.04s)]
*  Otherwise I'll just forever be this child inside of me. So if I want to have an adult life as well, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5726.48s)]
*  then I'm going to have to start to evolve some, you know? And some of that's kind of sad because [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5734.08s)]
*  you're letting, you're basically watching this child, like, you know, you're helping this child [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5739.759999999999s)]
*  grow up, but you're letting this child know like, Hey, you know, I'll take it from here. I love you. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5745.2s)]
*  I'm going to take care of you. You're not going to be able to run the show all the time anymore [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5752.400000000001s)]
*  because we got to grow up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, it's being a parent, you go through these [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5757.280000000001s)]
*  little micro griefs because, you know, it starts off, you are so in love with this baby. You're so [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5765.360000000001s)]
*  in love with like how, like just what it feels like to hold your kid, but they obviously, they grow. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5772.56s)]
*  And that baby goes away. It's gone. And there's a period where you're like, fuck, this is so sad. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5779.36s)]
*  This like beautiful, like kid is going to like change into something else. But then the next [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5786.72s)]
*  phase, you realize, oh, I love what this being is becoming. And so that, but that moment, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5794.4800000000005s)]
*  that weird liminal moment between like lives, because, you know, I think people reincarnate [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5801.44s)]
*  in a lifetime. Like what you're talking about, it is a weird form of, it's not obviously, it's not [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5807.68s)]
*  physical death, but it is, you're letting go of something. Oh, it feels like that a lot. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5812.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man. It really does. I can feel it. I can, there's moments I have where I can feel it and I [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5818.88s)]
*  can feel myself doing certain things that are like, okay, I'm going to put this child to bed, you know, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5823.6s)]
*  put this young, not let this, you know, this child is going to start to grow up. You know, he has to. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5829.6s)]
*  It's been too long. If he wants to have a family of his own, if he wants to be a father and be [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5835.92s)]
*  these things, he's going to have to. Dude, you'd be a great dad. Thanks. You know, the gift of having [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5841.84s)]
*  a sort of tumultuous childhood is that you, you, when you have a kid, like, I mean, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5847.4400000000005s)]
*  you get to fix that a little bit. Like you, you won't fix it completely. Like that's so crazy [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5856.56s)]
*  when like aspects of your parents that maybe weren't the most evolved bubble out of you. Oh, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5862.320000000001s)]
*  yeah. And you realize, shit, this is why my parents were acting the way they were acting. They probably [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5868.320000000001s)]
*  tried to stop this thing too. It's very hard, but you, you have a real reason to evolve because you [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5873.68s)]
*  don't want to like impact your kids in a dark way. So man, I'm telling you from a like spiritual, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5880.96s)]
*  like it's a, it's a brain scan, man. Like you will understand so much more about your parents, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5889.4400000000005s)]
*  mainly how much they loved you. You mainly you'll understand, holy fuck, they love me so much. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5896.0s)]
*  There's no way you can't feel this for your kid. And they tried their best. They tried their fucking [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5902.240000000001s)]
*  best. And they, and that's a really wild thing because then you have to forgive them. Like if [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5908.0s)]
*  you were carrying a chip on your shoulder about this or that, it'll, the chip will dissolve a [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5914.08s)]
*  little bit. But I got a fucking 12 pack of Pringles on my back. I've carried them. I've carried them. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5918.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that's a lot of Pringles, man. I've carried them a lot. I've tried to get, I've tried, you [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5923.68s)]
*  know, I do 12 step. I'm trying to get through some of it. I just have to work a little bit harder. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5929.76s)]
*  And some of it takes time too. You know, I've always been a slow evolve. I've been a really hard [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5933.68s)]
*  decider in my life. Everything's really slow. So some of it's just who I am, you know? Slow is good. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5940.08s)]
*  Fast is suspicious. Slow means you're like, when you do slow change, that's real change. Fast change, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5947.68s)]
*  whenever I do fast change, that's like month long, you know, it'll last for a month when I do a fast, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5954.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, whatever the fucking thing is. And you should be suspicious of anyone pitching fast [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5960.48s)]
*  change to you. It doesn't really work like that. It's slow. And it's supposed to be. And you don't [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5964.64s)]
*  need to be anything other than the way you are right now, man. Like that's just fine. Like this [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5970.56s)]
*  is fine. Like I'll tell you, when I met my wife, like I'd heard all these cheesy fucks who got [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5976.56s)]
*  married and had kids say, I knew we were going to get married. I knew we were going to have kids. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5986.0s)]
*  And I was like, okay, whatever. That's such horseshit. And then it happened to me. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5991.28s)]
*  It wasn't like, like, what happened? You just started talking to her and what happened? Let [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=5998.96s)]
*  me hit that ripper one more time. You got it, man. What happened was the best. It's like, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6003.44s)]
*  you know, it's like you watch people who put their foot in fast moving water. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6010.08s)]
*  And it's just like they're gone. It's like that. You know, like the concept of control when it [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6015.92s)]
*  comes to like dating and finding someone that you decide to like spend your life with. I think it's [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6023.76s)]
*  a little naive. Like I think there's big, big gears in the universe that we can't see like behind [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6030.0s)]
*  the watch face that are just turning. And I know this sounds so new agey and cheesy, but sometimes [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6037.04s)]
*  I think it's like you meet the person at just the right time because the souls of your kids [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6043.5199999999995s)]
*  are ready to come into the universe at that time. That makes sense. Like, you know what I mean? Like [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6050.08s)]
*  right now your kids could be like in their seventies or sixties right now in a previous life, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6055.04s)]
*  about to expire in a few years and then they're ready to pop back in. Yeah. And that's when you [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6061.679999999999s)]
*  meet the person who they've they choose you and then they bring you together. And then you [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6066.0s)]
*  like that's when it happens. I just, I mean, again, obviously this is probably just horse shit, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6072.24s)]
*  but when you're like, when it happens, you realize like, I don't know how much of this I had control [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6078.24s)]
*  over. I don't know how much I chose this and how much I was chosen for it. And so that means go [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6084.48s)]
*  slow. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a really good, that's really nice to think on. It's really nice to just [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6093.5199999999995s)]
*  kind of, yeah, cause it takes some of the pressure off of you. Like I don't feel a pressure to meet [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6100.16s)]
*  somebody now. I do feel like I try to be a little bit more like open about dating or trying to at [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6105.5199999999995s)]
*  least meet with somebody to see if they're that person or if there's a possibility, you know, like, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6113.36s)]
*  but it's been, it's definitely, it's been interesting. Yeah. But I like that, that, you know, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6120.48s)]
*  the next phase is supposed to come into the universe. And then what that, what is that going [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6124.96s)]
*  to be like? And how are you just part of the stepping stone for the next part of life? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6130.72s)]
*  Cause in a way that's really all you are. Like we have a ton of thoughts about, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6136.24s)]
*  like, if you just saw two animals go hump in the woods somewhere and then two months later, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6142.4800000000005s)]
*  they had a child, you'd be like, Oh, it seems, but if they were like pining around, if you followed [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6146.88s)]
*  one of the animals for like four years before, and he's just like fucking rubbing his weiner up [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6151.52s)]
*  against a bush and fucking, you know, like coming on, you know, just fucking chasing like, you know, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6156.160000000001s)]
*  other animals and shit. And you'd be like watching all his thoughts and he's like sleeping in the [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6162.96s)]
*  woods and fucking drinking dirty water to get fucked up and stuff. You'd be like, God, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6167.6s)]
*  getting dumb tattoos. Yeah. He rolls up like, yeah, if animals were like us and they fucking [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6173.040000000001s)]
*  rolled up with all these dumb tattoos and fucking CrossFit memberships and shit. And he's fucking. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6180.4s)]
*  Holy shit, man. Like, yeah. Old exercise video DVDs in their nest. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6188.639999999999s)]
*  Like, God animal, take it easy on yourself, man. One of these days, nature is just going to send [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6195.919999999999s)]
*  the right lioness along and it'll all make sense. You know? Yeah, exactly. Like think of like what [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6201.599999999999s)]
*  got you to where you're at now. And then when you really look at it, like obviously you made a choice [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6207.28s)]
*  to work hard. I think that is something we have control over. I chose work. You chose to work hard. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6212.88s)]
*  But then if you look at all the people who helped you and all the people you met and all the [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6217.28s)]
*  inspirations you got around a corner you didn't expect to turn down and all those things, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6222.5599999999995s)]
*  some point you have to be like, I don't know how much of this I'm responsible for. 100%. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6227.679999999999s)]
*  Other than working hard. So if that's the case, for everything good in a person's life, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6232.64s)]
*  it's going to be the same for meeting, you know, a person that you are going to be with [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6239.12s)]
*  in a serious way, like in a marriage situation. Because I think you rush the shit or you, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6245.6s)]
*  or more importantly, you pretend you're having the feeling that this is the person you'll spend [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6252.160000000001s)]
*  time with versus really having the feeling. Because there is night and day difference between [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6259.84s)]
*  the two. You get into trouble. You can't pretend. You have to listen. Because you know, you've, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6265.6s)]
*  I mean, it's nuts, man. Like you, you just knew, man, it was the weirdest. It was so [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6271.76s)]
*  weird. And where we all at a park or somewhere we all at? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6280.08s)]
*  Where you saw your lady at? Oh, yeah, I was doing a comedy show and she was friends with my friend [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6282.719999999999s)]
*  and yeah, she had just come there because like, you know, she's hanging out and then we are hanging [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6293.84s)]
*  out and then it was like, it's weird. It was weird, man. It was just like fusion or something. I can't [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6300.48s)]
*  explain it. I mean, this is not to say it was perfect. It's not to say like credits role movie, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6306.64s)]
*  like happy, you know, romantic movie score. I mean, I don't think any marriage could possibly [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6313.52s)]
*  be like that, but it was just, I don't know how to explain it other than it's like, oh yeah, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6318.56s)]
*  we are already married in some weird way. It's like, it's like rippling backwards through time. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6323.92s)]
*  Who knows? Maybe it's pheromones. You know what? I'm, you know, maybe the materials are right. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6330.72s)]
*  And it's just like her enough of the stink was my stink and her stink was a good like combination [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6334.72s)]
*  of stinks. You know, maybe, but I don't know. I feel like it was something bigger than that. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6342.08s)]
*  I think it will be for you too. It will be. And then you'll be like, holy shit. Wow. I'm fucking [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6347.280000000001s)]
*  married. I have kids. I've abandoned all that freedom. What have I done? Yeah. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6353.84s)]
*  Yeah. I'm just kidding. I'm just fucking kidding. Look, some of that makes sense. Yeah. Well, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6359.84s)]
*  the shit, the snake has to shed its skin or the snake dies. That's what I started to feel too. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6367.76s)]
*  I remember a few years ago, I was sitting in, uh, I was doing an episode of King in the Sting [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6373.12s)]
*  podcast because I usually work on there with Brendan Schaub and Crystal Lee and, and Eric [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6377.84s)]
*  Griffin. I don't know if Chris was on there yet, but I remember thinking like, I remember talking [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6382.32s)]
*  about to them, like, do we evolve? Like, when do we evolve? You know, like when do, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6387.2s)]
*  are there times in our lives as humans where we are like, I was almost asking the world. I feel [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6394.5599999999995s)]
*  like when I think back on that moment, cause I was surprised that I was thinking about it or asking [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6400.48s)]
*  about it, but I was like, when do we evolve? When do I evolve? And I didn't know what it meant really. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6405.04s)]
*  And I still don't exactly, but I think I was looking to evolve at that point. And I think a [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6410.639999999999s)]
*  lot of that was probably from that ayahuasca experience. That stuff's so powerful. You know, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6416.64s)]
*  have you been through it? Not yet. I'm a little afraid. I mean, I've, I've, you know, I've smoked [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6420.240000000001s)]
*  DMT like everybody else. So I've experienced like some taste of what it must be, but a four hour, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6424.64s)]
*  three hour DMT trip just sounds completely life altering. Like, and I know many people who have [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6429.84s)]
*  benefited massively from it. Uh, so I will eventually do it, but yeah, I mean, dude, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6437.76s)]
*  you, here's one idea. You don't need to evolve. Actually, the evolution is just realizing where [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6445.04s)]
*  you're at right now is perfect. That's the evolution. It's letting go of the fantasy [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6455.04s)]
*  of some future better version of you and loving yourself right now, instead of crucifying yourself [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6460.719999999999s)]
*  on what you should be or could be. This is perfect. Not just like the nice parts of you, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6467.2s)]
*  the whole spectrum is great. And that if you can really like, just let yourself play around with [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6473.84s)]
*  that. You, you take a vacation from self-hate or whatever though, or for most people, it's not [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6482.4s)]
*  self-hate though. That term gets thrown around a lot. It's more like self, like tiny micro [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6487.44s)]
*  aggressions against oneself, tiny moments where you like judge yourself as being, you know, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6495.04s)]
*  somehow unevolved or not enough or broken or whatever. Yeah. And then, you know, what happens [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6503.5199999999995s)]
*  for a lot of people doing that they get hit by a car crossing the street. They never evolve. They [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6510.48s)]
*  died. Their last thought was hating themselves or I didn't order a bus. Yes, dude. So like, this is [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6516.48s)]
*  to me, that's the, anytime, and I'm not able to do, I'm very neurotic and quite often I will [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6525.360000000001s)]
*  get down on myself. But anytime I'm able, especially in the midst of like really bad times, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6530.56s)]
*  to not resist that, to just like, this is what's happening. I'm part of the universe. And right now, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6536.88s)]
*  I fucking stink and I'm tired and I'm annoyed and I was just an asshole to the guy putting [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6544.64s)]
*  doorknobs on the door in my house. But this is where I'm at right now. This is it. Yeah. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6550.96s)]
*  Somehow that's where the aggression that causes all the things we wish we didn't do dissipates. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6558.32s)]
*  And then suddenly just the universe again. You're just part of the web of everything. And it's [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6565.68s)]
*  really a delight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know there are moments like that. I had a couple moments [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6571.52s)]
*  this morning, I just hit my knees. I was like, God, I just, I can't do anything. Right? Nothing [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6576.48s)]
*  is, you know, just let me just be a part of the world. Let me just realize none of this matters. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6582.4s)]
*  I'm not going to, there's nothing I'm going to do today that's going to change the fucking world. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6590.5599999999995s)]
*  There's nothing I'm going to do today that's going to alter my life in some huge way. Let me just try [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6594.959999999999s)]
*  and be palatable to other people today. You know, dude, I love it. That and I think that is a noble [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6601.2s)]
*  aspiration. And I think that that is a wonderful everyone, dude, I know, because I'm guilty of it, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6607.28s)]
*  man. I like, I instantaneously want to be better when I'm sick. I want to be better tomorrow. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6612.4s)]
*  When I'm like, when I'm too fat, I want to lose the fucking weight tomorrow. Yeah, I don't want [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6619.36s)]
*  the slow boil. I want to instantaneously change and the whole universe doesn't work like that. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6626.56s)]
*  Nothing works like that except bad things. You can like instantaneously make yourself worse. Yeah, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6631.4400000000005s)]
*  like 9-11. Yes, but the good stuff, it's slow. Like it's like the comparison gets made to [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6637.6s)]
*  one way to think of your life is like rising sun versus setting sun. And like, look at the way the [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6645.92s)]
*  sun rises. It is so for such an incredibly powerful event. It's so weirdly slow, like the way the [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6650.72s)]
*  light gradually changes. That's anyone's life. And that's, that's why it's like shit, man, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6658.88s)]
*  a temporary cloud passes in front of a sunrise. And it might seem like it's becoming night again. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6667.2s)]
*  But that's just a, it's a cloud. You know, it's getting the sun's rising, you know what's happening. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6674.240000000001s)]
*  And you just start trusting that. And then at least for me, you know, I become less, it's just [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6680.0s)]
*  a paradoxical because somehow by not attempting to elevate myself to some super egoic spiritual [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6685.76s)]
*  position, I've, that's where happiness seems to appear. Yeah, just trust in the sun. Just [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6694.88s)]
*  trusting the speed of the sun, you know. Yeah, trust in the speed of the sun. It's been there [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6701.52s)]
*  for a long time. It knows what it's doing. I think it knows what it's doing. Yeah. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6706.08s)]
*  Yeah. At this point, let's rely on a few things that know what they're doing, you know. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6710.24s)]
*  Yeah. You can trust the sun. I mean, maybe not this, they were getting, apparently we're [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6713.52s)]
*  getting blasted by solar flares, not to fuck up whatever spiritual apex we just hit. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6717.04s)]
*  It's we're getting blasted by like, I don't know, class 50 flares. They're like, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6725.68s)]
*  the internet's going to go down. But in general, you can trust the sun. Yeah. In general. Yeah. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6730.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a general hypothesis. Yeah. You know, I think it's been [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6736.4s)]
*  interesting. I've been dealing with my own ego too in the past year. That's been interesting, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6743.839999999999s)]
*  you know, as life gets busier and as my ego is very scary to me. You know, the ego is very scary. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6747.36s)]
*  I feel like. Well, how do you describe your ego? What's your? Just like moments where I notice that [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6755.28s)]
*  I think I'm deserving of things or I expect things. And I can't tell if some of it's just [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6760.24s)]
*  because I'm busier. And so you need things to kind of, you know, you get used to some, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6764.72s)]
*  but it's like, I want to be able to show up in like my best way all the time, you know? And so, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6770.4800000000005s)]
*  so then it takes more work to kind of like cultivate and nurture that best way of yourself. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6776.240000000001s)]
*  And just kind of rolling with the, you know, it's like, so yeah, I think the ego really scares me [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6784.88s)]
*  because you don't know what it is. You know, it's the ego is always there. Yeah. It's like [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6790.4s)]
*  your shadow. It's always connected to you and it can, it's such a trickster, you know, and you can, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6795.5199999999995s)]
*  it can make you feel deserve into things. It can make you feel smarter than, you know, it's like, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6804.48s)]
*  I just have to be care. I just, I'm, it's just something that's been kind of like on my mind. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6814.0s)]
*  It's so, it's so embarrassing. The ego is the source of embarrassment because it's just like, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6819.6s)]
*  oh my dude, what the fuck? Theo wants me to do his podcast again. What the fuck? Why won't he do mine? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6826.56s)]
*  Well, he must hate me. Does he secretly hate me? I wonder if Theo Vaughn secretly hates me. That's, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6833.36s)]
*  you just told me you're in a bad spot. Not once was my ego compassionate. Not once was like, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6838.0s)]

*  times you have like fucked up sending an email or like been in a rotten depressed state and have [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6846.56s)]
*  not wanted to talk to anybody. No, it didn't cross my ego's mind. My ego puffs out, gets butt hurt, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6853.84s)]
*  limps around. It's like, ah, it's so, it's so embarrassing. It's so embarrassing. But to react [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6860.56s)]

*  have a gold chain. Like I think there'll be gold chains and there would definitely be spandex [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=6996.4s)]
*  involved. Maybe like a fashion cane. Yeah. And somebody carrying a microwave for you that just [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7001.52s)]

*  there is a way you could like act, you could do that show without having to have some futuristic [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7075.68s)]
*  technology, but people would have to be completely honest with you and not afraid to, and I think it [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7080.8s)]

*  bearing of our souls, you know, in ways. Yeah. Maybe that will come as we get more technology that [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7100.96s)]
*  tells us more about what's going on. Like that's the plane we're missing a lot of times with a lot [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7109.44s)]
*  of like medical intuition or discovery through like MRIs and like, it's like I wish there was another [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7114.719999999999s)]

*  do you see that video? You see that Tito Ortiz? Can you pull that out? There was a Tito Ortiz [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7178.400000000001s)]
*  video where he hit Mach 7 or 8. Whoa. And it shows you, I think it made me think about, wow, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7182.8s)]
*  what goes on inside of us and what a shell our body is. Yeah, man. Yeah, man. It's so wild. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7191.92s)]

*  turtles in it. There's everything. Dude, a turtle swam up on the beach the other day in Maui and I [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7205.52s)]
*  went on vacation and a turtle was there. And it was just fascinating. People like going up and [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7210.72s)]
*  seeing it and spending time by it. They're so mystical. The Hawaiian turtles are like [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7217.92s)]
*  holy creatures. You feel lucky to be around them. They're just, they're so beautiful. You ever go [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7223.68s)]

*  that's like not their best on shore. They're kind of clumsy, slow, but in the water, holy shit. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7236.16s)]
*  They're just, you know, they seem like they would grant a wish or something. Yeah. They're beautiful. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7242.8s)]

*  wrestler. He is a, he's also, he does, one thing that's really neat about him, he does all of the [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7262.24s)]
*  meals at the Laugh Factory. He goes there and passes out food. That's cool. On Thanksgiving. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7271.76s)]
*  He's a philanthropic dude. That's cool. And he's a famous UFC fighter. Can we go back and, yeah, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7277.76s)]
*  let's see that video, but watch what happens. It's interesting to see what happens to the shell of us [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7284.32s)]
*  at certain levels. Yeah. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7288.56s)]
*  Oh, fuck that. Wow. He's in there. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7319.360000000001s)]
*  This is a nine G simulator. Holy shit. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7325.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7333.360000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7336.4s)]
*  Go back to that moment where his face is limp. It's kind of fascinating just to see what your, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7348.32s)]
*  and just pause it right there. If you can find it, Zach, on that screen. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7352.719999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. That's it. I mean, right there, I was like, wow, we are just, our body, it's just such a [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7355.28s)]
*  shell. I mean, here's one of the toughest men, you know. How old are you? I'm 43. I'm 48, man. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7367.2s)]
*  That is what I look like when I wake up. That's... [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7373.04s)]
*  You got to sew it back together. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7375.36s)]
*  Push it up. Electra Shock to get the things to work again. Yeah, that's crazy that that's, yeah, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7384.32s)]
*  the mask is just sort of drooping off the skull, the eyes. Yeah, man. That's, that's fucked. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7391.759999999999s)]
*  And that's almost a way of looking at your, you know, that's a ego deflating moment. To have this [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7399.36s)]
*  moment just be out there for him. That's pretty cool. Just like, this is, if you let my body just, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7406.0s)]
*  let me show you what it is at its unrefined form, you know. This is, you know, Rogan talks about, [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7412.96s)]
*  like, this is like the benefit of martial arts or like, you know, because you're, you're, you're, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7420.639999999999s)]
*  getting beaten up. Like, I don't know much about him. I'm guessing in front of the planet, he's been [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7427.68s)]
*  knocked out maybe or defeated. I don't know. And once that happens to you, that, you know, whatever [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7434.16s)]
*  it is, the insecurity and stuff, you already got, you know, you know that you are not perfect. You [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7441.4400000000005s)]
*  know you're going to lose fights. You know the way you got good at fighting is not by winning every [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7446.0s)]
*  fight. And so apparently there's like a benefit to that, you know, to knowing where you're at, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7450.56s)]
*  you know. That's why he does stuff like that. That's, you know, man, anytime you get around, like, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7456.72s)]
*  anytime I've been around Rogan and we get to be around like a famous fighter, they are weirdly [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7462.4800000000005s)]
*  similar to people at the Romanovs retreat. They've got this glow to them. I mean, again, I'm making a [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7469.4400000000005s)]
*  blanket assessment for a few people I've met. No, no. Oh yeah. There's something fascinating [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7475.84s)]
*  about them. It's almost like seeing some of them. It's like being around one of those turtles kind [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7480.16s)]
*  of. Yes, they have this holy quality to them or this spiritual component and they, you would [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7483.76s)]
*  almost forget the person you're sitting next to if for whatever reason they decided to, they would [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7490.8s)]
*  be the last person you saw. You would like see them lunge towards you and that's it. You're dead. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7495.84s)]
*  You just forget. It's like hanging around a really well-behaved pit bull or something. You forget [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7503.5199999999995s)]
*  and also because they're just so sweet. They're so sweet. And there's something interesting about [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7510.639999999999s)]
*  being able to be knocked out, like being able to put yourself in that risk space, you know, of like. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7515.76s)]
*  Yes. Because it's such a defeating thing, you know, being knocked out. It's everybody's biggest fear. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7521.36s)]
*  What if I got, I was unconscious in front of other, like you're at, you have no control over yourself. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7527.04s)]
*  You are, you are at a level, at a, you are limp. You're limp in front of the planet. Yeah. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7533.04s)]
*  Your wife might be in the audience. Your kids are in the audience watching. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7542.88s)]
*  Daddy. Your ego. Yeah. Your ego is like, what the fuck? You fucking pussy. Look at you. I told you [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7547.84s)]
*  to fucking dope. I told you to use that new synthetic fucking testosterone the Russians [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7557.92s)]
*  developed. Yeah, man. I that's like, yeah, it's you. There's something about, you know, okay. I don't [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7563.28s)]
*  know if you're familiar. Are you familiar? You're probably familiar with Jack Kerouac, the beat poets. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7570.32s)]
*  So I used to think the beat poets is they're called Kerouac. I guess Ginsburg falls into that [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7574.56s)]
*  category. What about what's his name? Who was all, uh, um, William Burroughs Vonnegut. Was he a beat poet? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7579.6s)]
*  I think he was at the same time period, but I don't know for sure. I wish I were more literary [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7587.759999999999s)]
*  than I am. He wasn't really in like the beat pack. Beat pack was that Kerouac, um, you know, uh, who [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7592.799999999999s)]
*  else? William Burroughs. Burroughs, that's right. I think Kukowski kind of gets lumped in there a [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7597.759999999999s)]
*  little bit. Yeah. Does Ginsburg land there or was I totally off? Yes. No, Ginsburg is there too. So, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7601.2s)]
*  so like I used to think beat meant like, like the beat of like, I don't know, a Congo or some shit, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7605.28s)]

*  But what I read is it means defeated. We're beat. We've already been beat. We lost. It's over. We [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7618.16s)]
*  beat. We're not trying to win anymore. And in that place being beat, that's where you find freedom. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7626.8s)]
*  That's where you find true liberation. You're, you've disconnected from the fucking horrible drums [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7635.5199999999995s)]

*  were like, we're beat taking bong hits, doing ketamine, playing God of War. It's like, [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7669.68s)]
*  not that that's the worst experience. You know what I mean? So it's, but that state of consciousness [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7678.240000000001s)]
*  of like, yeah, like I'm already, I think we're, another way to put it would be at least we're [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7684.16s)]
*  beat in the sense you're not going to do better than the, than the earth. You're not going to like [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7690.72s)]

*  Yeah. Let me operate from a place of, I am not the king. Yes. And it's such a wonderful thing [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7708.24s)]
*  to stop trying to save the fucking planet. It's such a wonderful thing to stop trying to be [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7716.719999999999s)]
*  because you, the ego is so deceptive that it will convince you that you are demonstrating [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7723.6s)]
*  some altruistic impulse. Yes. When really you want to be the goddamn Messiah. You want to be Jesus. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7730.0s)]
*  You want to like save the, you want to be the only person who saves the planet. You want the credit. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7736.4800000000005s)]

*  You know, like, and that was very scary to me. I just didn't know. And I was like, what if I'm [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7758.400000000001s)]
*  not doing things right? Or like, what if I can't handle this type of, if I just had never had like, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7763.12s)]
*  you know, it's scary when people come to spend time with, you know, it's like, why me? You know, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7772.400000000001s)]
*  you start asking and your ego will start answering sometimes if you're not fucking, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7777.76s)]
*  you know, if you don't have some inkling or some guidance or hearing good things from people that [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7782.240000000001s)]
*  are helping you navigate things. Sure. But I remember that I remember thinking, man, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7787.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to be a leader, you know, so this is real scary. Now I'm going to have, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7793.76s)]
*  how do I pretend to be a leader? You know, and then that eventually kind of went away. And I realized [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7800.0s)]
*  that that was a fool's gold thing, but it was very scary. I remember when that happened, I was like, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7805.4400000000005s)]
*  fuck, like, but to think that, yeah, like, I'm just a part of this thing and we've all, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7810.8s)]
*  we're all defeated. How do we operate now? Right. What now? Like now, and I'll tell you, man, [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7818.320000000001s)]
*  if you look at the, like, like the Messiah or God as being like, you look at the Messiah as being not [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7824.56s)]
*  the next Messiah, the second coming of Christ, whatever you want to call it, the Matreya, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7832.72s)]
*  if you look at it not as being one person, but rather a harmonized group of God knows how many [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7836.56s)]
*  people or just think about Jesus. Like, I don't know how many people talk about like Jesus's, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7845.360000000001s)]
*  like, or think of Mary. Who is Mary's great grandfather, right? Like Mary's great [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7851.4400000000005s)]

*  offensive, but okay, you know what, I'll replace Messiahs. Think of like the Buddha's great [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7863.52s)]
*  grandmother. Like, imagine if that great grandmother decided not to let someone [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7869.4400000000005s)]

*  there would be no Buddha. So it's like, when you start looking at the fact that like, we are all [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7884.160000000001s)]
*  part of not just like the shitty things the planet spits out, but theoretically, you could be, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7889.68s)]
*  wouldn't you like to be one pixel in the Buddha? One pixel, one cell, one little tiny part of [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7895.84s)]

*  It's like you won't, you know, there's a story, Ram Dass's brother, I guess. That's great, man. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7916.88s)]
*  That's a great way to say that. That's a great way to say that. Like, how can I just be a cell [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7921.68s)]
*  in the wellness of whatever, you know? Or how do I just show up enough to be a part of things in a [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7926.4800000000005s)]

*  ego's looking for, but in a much more realistic, in a much more interactive way. Like now you don't, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7940.24s)]
*  and you know, all the great stories. I mean, God, look at what Jesus said when he sent out the [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7948.88s)]
*  disciples. I think it was something along the lines of, don't worry what you're going to say, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7953.12s)]
*  I'm going to speak through you. And if people don't accept you, shake the dust from your sandals and [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7956.88s)]

*  is that you don't have to worry anymore. Like you're taken care of now. You don't need to worry. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=7970.64s)]

*  something that feels good. And it doesn't feel like it's about me. It feels like just a part of [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8017.68s)]
*  something that feels good. And I think everybody like, I think there's a general, I think as a [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8023.280000000001s)]

*  to lead us to the, to the be all end all, and that we were going to be able to crack the code. Like [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8054.0s)]

*  essentially this kid ruins his life. He becomes some kind of like a pig farmer, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8121.92s)]
*  which apparently back then was like the worst thing you could be. And so in shame and humiliation, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8127.84s)]

*  So yeah, basically the story is he goes back home and his dad takes one look at him and he's [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8168.4s)]
*  legitimately like, I fucked up. I let my ego take control. I thought I was going to be able to do [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8179.839999999999s)]

*  So what you're talking about with in any individual life, especially like when you finally [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8265.2s)]

*  And you can't remember a lot of that shit. And then suddenly, holy shit, you start coming back [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8290.48s)]
*  to life. That's what it's about for the individual. But for what you're saying is like for humanity [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8295.439999999999s)]
*  as a whole. I think that's what's so beautiful about it is there's the possibility for the [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8299.84s)]
*  entirety of the species to reorient itself into another way of being. And at least because, you [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8304.0s)]
*  know, it's obvious from the Bible, it's theistic. The message is God doesn't care how much money you [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8312.64s)]
*  spent on the stupid break dancer clothes you were wearing or your failed Etsy business or all the [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8319.2s)]
*  people you lied to or all the people you stabbed in the back, as long as those things brought you [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8325.92s)]
*  back home. That's all that matters. As long as you're able to come and say, I'm sorry and mean it. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8331.04s)]
*  That's what I love about that story. And I think like that's what humanity has to look forward to, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8338.16s)]
*  probably. I do. I think, yeah, maybe we did right now we're like fucking scooping up pig shit or [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8342.800000000001s)]
*  whatever and pretending it's gold. But I have a feeling like, you know, we'll come back around. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8348.64s)]
*  We'll come back around. Yeah. If a person can come back around, all of us can come back. Yeah. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8354.0s)]
*  Because all we are is just a person, really. We're all just one person, as you're saying. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8359.359999999999s)]
*  You're right, man. Just one very complex, very, very big person. Yeah. And you have to and yeah, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8363.439999999999s)]
*  you have to start thinking how do we all win as a species? Like how what little part can I do to [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8371.439999999999s)]
*  help us be a part of that? Or not even what can I do, but how do I just operate in a way that [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8376.72s)]
*  behooves everyone? And how can I do that more today? Yeah, that's it. That's a nice question to have [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8384.64s)]
*  each day. Each day. How can I do that more today for my fellow man? Yeah. For my fellow specie member? [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8390.48s)]
*  Yeah. It's a good question. And sometimes you will not be able to answer it. No. Yeah, sometimes [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8397.359999999999s)]
*  you'll go and you'll slink back off. But I think having that as a good question is nice. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8403.28s)]
*  And that's the neat thing about life is sometimes once certain things get introduced to you, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8414.24s)]
*  you can't unintroduce them. Yeah. And that's one thing that's really cool. It's like, man, [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8418.320000000002s)]
*  once you kind of see a little bit of the light, you can't unsee it. No. That's one thing that's [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8424.24s)]
*  neat about getting into recovery programs. Even like you were saying, you were dead. Once you can [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8431.44s)]
*  look back and see that, like, oh, I wasn't a contributing member to myself, to anyone. I wasn't [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8436.0s)]
*  able to love my sister. I wasn't able to love my brother. I wasn't able to love myself and how you [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8441.44s)]
*  can start to do those things better. Yeah, man. And the times I've been in those rooms, [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8448.08s)]
*  when you, it's what's cool about it is you see people who like you thought you hit bottom, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8455.76s)]
*  like you see people who like fucking they did the same thing China's doing right now. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8464.16s)]
*  We're like, they're trying to dig a hole to the center of the earth. You're like, are you kidding [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8468.800000000001s)]
*  me? What the fuck? You know, the stories are crazy. But then the fact that you're looking at them, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8473.44s)]
*  they're healthy. They're happy. They're doing great. That is where you realize how incredibly [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8480.72s)]
*  powerful it is to be a human. Yes. They sure as fuck shouldn't have climbed out of that hole. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8489.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Some of those holes, man, you know what I'm talking about. There's seven, yeah, there's seven [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8493.439999999999s)]
*  story holes. Dude. Eight stories, 12 stories. Like, how did you get a hole this deep? How did you even [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8497.76s)]
*  do it? Yeah. You didn't even have a shovel. Like if I told someone, I'm going to pay you, I will pay [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8504.0s)]
*  you $500,000 to destroy your life in this way. They wouldn't be able to do it. And these people [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8509.52s)]
*  did it just with whiskey. Like inhalants. It's like a tap. Oh, that's fucking cool, man. What time we [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8516.16s)]
*  had that? Like two hour, 20 minutes. I'm like, a little under. Okay. I'm trying to think of something [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8529.2s)]
*  else I wanted to think about with you. You were talking about sex in the graveyard. I can actually [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8537.76s)]
*  chime in on that. I worked with a guy in a pizza shop who, uh, this is a true story. I delivered [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8545.12s)]
*  pizzas with this guy, Steve, and he would take his wife. They had kids who they would hire a sitter [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8550.4s)]
*  every Saturday and they would go have sex in a graveyard. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah. Yeah. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8554.56s)]
*  His wife's name was Angel and she was 390 pounds. What? And were they Mexican? Because a lot of [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8559.36s)]
*  Mexicans, they weren't? No, white trash, Ohio. A lot of Mexicans go, that's one thing I love that [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8564.64s)]
*  Mexicans do. They do that El Dia de los Muertos, you know? And they go celebrate in the graveyard [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8570.48s)]
*  with the deceased Mexicans. It's a big part of the culture. Like if you're in LA, you can go on [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8576.16s)]
*  Halloween to the graveyards and it is like, you know, it's like a damn Selena, you know, like concert. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8581.359999999999s)]
*  The Hollywood Forever Cemetery has, it's incredible. It's awesome. It's beautiful. And it's not, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8588.24s)]
*  you expect it to be like morbid or grim, but it isn't at all. It's celebratory. It's beautiful. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8593.84s)]
*  You could see how they're honoring these people. It's really incredible. Yeah. I mean, you can eat [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8599.44s)]
*  an empanada with a 700 year old Mexican dude. Yes. Yeah. You can. Oh yeah. The Ramones are buried [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8603.68s)]
*  there. That's right. That cemetery is pretty wild. It is. It's, and they, that's where, I don't know [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8612.640000000001s)]
*  if they do it anymore, but they used to do movies there, like on the weekends. I think they still do. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8617.44s)]
*  I actually went with James Blake. He's a musician. He's been on here before. He's a really, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8622.72s)]
*  really amazing British producer and musician. And he, he and I went to El Dia de los Muertos one time [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8627.519999999999s)]
*  and they had music and they had, yeah, just Mexican families just sitting with their deceased [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8635.039999999999s)]
*  ancestors. Yeah. It's really sweet. I mean, it's so, so sophisticated. Like the way a lot of people [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8640.32s)]
*  do death is really like fucked up. You try not to think about it. You just try it, like someone dies [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8647.44s)]
*  and you know, you just try to put them out of your head. I mean, I've attended that. And they don't, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8653.6s)]
*  and they don't really disappear. It's funny because I can think about my father, right? And I can think [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8657.68s)]
*  about how he feels, how is, I can think about what he wears. I can think about his voice is alive [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8662.560000000001s)]
*  inside of my head and in my heart. I can feel it. I can, I can put my hand on my heart and it's his [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8670.32s)]
*  heartbeat. Like part of my, the beat of my heart was made by two other people's beats. It's a mute, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8678.56s)]
*  it's a fucking song that's inside of me that was created by, you know, so it's really, [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8684.16s)]
*  we really do do that poorly. I think in, in, or I've done that poorly in my life is honoring [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8692.08s)]
*  um, the deceased, you know, honoring the people that put their time in so I could exist. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8699.92s)]
*  You know, maybe part of the problem is it's so bizarre when you lose someone, when you realize [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8708.0s)]
*  somehow, even though their bodies aren't here, they're closer than they've ever been to you. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8713.36s)]
*  Like you have this sense, no, they're here. I mean, not in like a ghost paranormal way, but like [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8717.92s)]
*  something deeper than that, just like what you're saying. And you don't, you, it's hard for people [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8722.32s)]
*  to deal with that. It's almost heartbreaking in a way, or you're afraid to connect with them. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8728.16s)]
*  You have a sense anytime you do, they've just been waiting for you to reach out. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8733.92s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. It's almost ashamed. There's a little bit of shame. If I were to [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8737.68s)]
*  sit and really just go spend time like in a room or in an open field and tell my father, [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8743.6s)]
*  I wanted to talk to him or spend time with him. Part of me would feel ashamed that it took me so [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8748.48s)]
*  long to do it. Yeah. Yeah. And you know what? I've, when I've like presented that shame to [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8753.12s)]
*  like my mom's soul or whatever you want to call that, the response is always, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8760.320000000002s)]
*  I love you. They don't, there's no like, why didn't you fucking use ayahuasca to talk to me? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8768.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's just a sense of like, I love you so much. Enjoy your life. Enjoy your life. You're [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8775.52s)]
*  doing great. I love you. It's this place is for love. Nothing else. That's always been the, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8782.0s)]
*  the, the sort of the message, you know, I, it's, I, they don't seem to even see [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8788.8s)]
*  shame or they're on the, I think whatever it is. Why were you watching Dateline? They're never like [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8797.28s)]
*  that. Why, why, why the fuck were you obsessed with Keith Morrison? Yeah. Why did you work for [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8801.76s)]
*  a week to try to do a Keith Morrison impression that you could never pull off? [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8809.52s)]
*  But what about that avocado? Not bad. Thank you. Not bad. Yeah, man. It's just, [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8816.08s)]
*  yeah, it's right. Why'd you go to that Duran Duran concert the other night? Yeah, they're not, they [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8822.960000000001s)]
*  just, it's like, I think whatever is on the other side as they call it is so beautiful. You know, [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8827.76s)]
*  where Amda says it's like taking off a shoe that's too tight. It's death. Death is like taking off a [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8833.2s)]
*  shoe that's too tight. Whatever's over there is so, so beautiful and so much more real than this [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8838.4s)]
*  place that beings that are there, they are, they just want us to be happy. They are just love, [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8843.92s)]
*  you know, and also, you know, as a parent, like if my kid somehow reaches through the veil to [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8855.119999999999s)]
*  communicate with me after I'm dead, I'm not going to be like, look at your fucking shitty shirt. Why [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8861.44s)]
*  do you have gravy all over your shirt? Change your oil. You're not going to be yelling that. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8867.92s)]
*  Change your oil, boy. I taught you to do that. I taught you you're going to burn your engine out. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8873.92s)]
*  It's easy. I'll buy you that fucking car with the inheritance. Yeah, dude, it's like, they just love, [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8880.24s)]
*  that's it. That's it. That's a fundamental fabric of everything is that kind of energy. Yeah. And [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8889.36s)]
*  you're right. The darkness part is it's like, you know, turning on a light, you just turn on the [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8895.84s)]
*  light. That's all it is, man. It's like the darkness is really the weakest of things when [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8900.72s)]
*  you consider how it's so you just flip a light switch, light a candle, it's gone. Yeah. Wasn't [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8905.68s)]
*  really there. And you usually need other people to do it. You need, yeah, that's why isolation [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8911.68s)]
*  kills so many alcoholics and so many addicts. That's why isolation kill creates so many school [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8917.84s)]
*  shooters and like severe, like violent nihilists. I don't know what nihilist means. Yeah, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8923.68s)]
*  nihilism, the idea that all you are is atoms. I mean, if you want to take it to the furthest [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8932.4s)]
*  point, it's like this is essentially an accident. Big Bang happens and just by like time and [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8941.52s)]
*  molecules swirling together, we became what did you call it? Reactive. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8951.44s)]
*  We became reactive meat earlier on. You had a really nihilistic description of human [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8959.04s)]
*  human beings were just temporarily sentient. We are doomed to die. We didn't ask to be fucking born. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8963.68s)]
*  And here we are mortals in a universe of infinite atoms. But whatever we are, it's just a fucking [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8971.36s)]
*  accident, like just a bad collision between the wrong organic molecules a long time ago. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8979.76s)]
*  And some oxygen. And some fucking oxygen and fuck it. And then do you believe that's true or not? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8987.52s)]
*  No, I don't believe that's true at all. My experience of life is the opposite of that. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8993.04s)]
*  And it's interesting because I feel like we've created a society kind of in the U.N. America [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=8998.880000000001s)]
*  where if you're not careful, you can kind of, you can get lapped in a belief in that. We have a [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9003.68s)]
*  society that really, you know, we've created that a lot of things that mean a lot to us or that should [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9008.24s)]
*  or really just wares for sale. Or that even our important moments or I don't know, I feel like [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9015.44s)]
*  there's been some deviation. But I think there's like you're saying, there's a lot, if you cannot [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9025.52s)]
*  see that, if you can find other people and listen, if you can just be open to possibility, [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9030.16s)]
*  you can quickly get back to a place that feels good. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9037.84s)]
*  Yes, because that's what you actually are. The place that feels good is you. Fundamental goodness. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9040.880000000001s)]
*  That's you. That's ground level, whatever you want to call it, bedrock. The bedrock and everything [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9046.160000000002s)]
*  else is just defense mechanisms. And yeah, exactly. You'll know when you're there because [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9051.84s)]
*  you're already, the paradox is you're already there. And it's just like so many comparisons. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9058.240000000002s)]
*  It's like a lantern that's got a lot of dirt or dust on it, you know what I mean? Your soul [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9062.56s)]
*  is the light. The lantern is your countless incarnations. And once you clear away the dust, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9071.68s)]
*  boom, there you are again. And that's the weird, I don't know if you had it with Ayahuasca, but with [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9078.08s)]
*  DMT, that's that weird familiarity. People report, which I certainly experienced, where you're like, [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9081.92s)]
*  oh, I know this place. There was nothing to be afraid of. This is just a place of love and joy [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9088.32s)]
*  and delight and fuck, I've been so hard on myself. I was a cockroach for 50 incarnations. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9094.8s)]
*  Just like you said earlier, what was I doing? What was I doing beating myself up? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9105.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing great. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9110.4s)]
*  I'm doing great. Yeah. And truly, if you're a human, at least from the Buddhist perspective, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9111.6s)]
*  it's the rarity of the human incarnation from the Buddhist cosmology. They think there's more gods [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9116.880000000001s)]
*  than there are humans. If you are lucky enough to be born a human, you've really, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9123.44s)]
*  you probably weren't a cockroach. You have done some heavy lifting to land in the human realm. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9128.480000000001s)]
*  Especially, there's a weird kind of like multiverse aspect of Buddhism a lot of people [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9135.119999999999s)]
*  don't know about, but to be born in a realm where there was a Buddha, where there was a Jesus, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9140.4s)]
*  I mean, you pick your Messiah, because there's the possibility of being born in a time when nobody [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9145.439999999999s)]
*  had any kind of spiritual technology developed. So to be in a world where that, we have got like [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9151.92s)]
*  volumes, volumes of incredible spiritual technology that anytime you want, you can connect to is [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9158.8s)]
*  very good karma, very good fortune. It's a great point. It's very good fortune. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9165.439999999999s)]
*  Do you think if they proved aliens, if there was some proof of them, like, and obviously if there [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9169.84s)]
*  was some further proof that really set in everybody, like everybody, it was like, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9174.96s)]
*  you know, was like, what was the difference between a human being and a cockroach? [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9180.96s)]
*  Was like, wow, they're there. They're out there with what would that do to religion? Do you think [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9187.84s)]
*  that would strengthen it? Or do you think that would weaken it? Well, I mean, I, you know, [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9194.08s)]
*  I think it depends on the religion and the lineage of the religion. I mean, if you've been living [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9199.04s)]
*  in a religion that is doing the same thing for humanity that we used to do for planet Earth, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9204.08s)]
*  the Earth was the center of the universe. If you've been living in some mindset that humanity is [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9209.44s)]
*  the, you know, the sum total of or like the final part of God's creation or something, [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9214.96s)]
*  then yeah, it's going to fuck with your head because now you have to deal with the fact that [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9222.64s)]
*  no, there's the universe is teeming with life on every level from the subatomic to the like, [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9226.0s)]
*  to giant planets to God knows what, to the point where we might be some atomic portion of [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9233.28s)]
*  something we'll never understand. So yeah, but I think, you know, a lot of religions already have [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9242.08s)]
*  built in the idea that we're talking about the source of all reality, a kind of super intelligent, [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9247.12s)]
*  progenitive, benevolent creator force that just delights in making stuff and delights in like [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9254.24s)]
*  sharing its creation with the things it makes. We get to co-create with it. It invites us to like [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9265.68s)]
*  sit down at the potters wheel with it and make stuff while we're here. So it's a really wonderful [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9273.2s)]
*  artist, whoever it is, whatever it is, and it's the best kind of artist. It doesn't like, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9278.800000000001s)]
*  where are the, there's no signatures, there's no copyright, there's no IP it's claiming for [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9283.36s)]
*  some total of all things. It's that incredible. It's like Banksy. Nobody knows who Banksy is. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9289.119999999999s)]
*  It's like that. It's just like, here, have it all. I'm giving you all of it. Let's see what you do [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9297.439999999999s)]
*  with it. It's beautiful. So I think from that perspective, aliens, sure, why not? And what if [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9303.84s)]
*  aliens, they also had a God too, what if they rolled up with a couple of gods? We would figure it out. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9309.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's where it would, that's what would be so exciting. It's like, what? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9315.28s)]
*  Who do they believe in? Who are you worshiping? Who is your God? What is an alien God like? And [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9319.84s)]
*  what do they think of our idea of God? Or what if they're like, oh, like Richard fucking Dawkins, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9325.12s)]
*  and they're pissed at us. There's no God, you dumb shits. We made you. We're your fucking God. Look [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9330.24s)]
*  at us. Big black eyes, emotionless face. We made you. You just hallucinated all the other stuff [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9337.04s)]
*  because we built that into you. It's like believe in a God because that makes you easy to control. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9344.8s)]
*  We would beat them up then. We would. Oh, I think we would. I think we would fight to have a God. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9350.48s)]
*  The first alien human world star fight, like when a human finally just punches an alien, [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9356.56s)]
*  it's weird to think our kids might see that, man. It's weird to think that we might see. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9365.759999999998s)]
*  See, I don't think there's a lot of beef between black. I have some black friends and they said [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9370.48s)]
*  there's a lot of beef between blacks and aliens, too. What? Yeah. That's like we don't hear about [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9376.24s)]
*  because we're not, you know, I guess in that culture that much. But yeah, there's a lot of [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9382.0s)]
*  black alien. What? Yeah, they don't get along. They don't. Yeah, they don't get along that much. I [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9388.24s)]
*  mean, how many black do you even know are like, yeah, we have like alien posters or anything like [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9395.92s)]
*  that, you know? I mean, I honestly I don't know anyone who is alien posters, but like I do know [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9400.08s)]
*  black people who are like super into aliens. But maybe maybe I got to meet more black folks then, [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9406.88s)]
*  you know, maybe. Who knows? It's like I don't know. I mean, I get I know there's a lot of people who [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9411.84s)]
*  like are think they're demons. I mean, that's one of the threads of like that's one of the [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9417.68s)]
*  explanations for them is it's like, no, these are the legions of Satan coming to the earth to pose [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9425.12s)]
*  as aliens and trick us into getting on those fucking ships. Don't get on the ships. Don't get [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9433.76s)]
*  on the ships because they're going to fly you right to hell. Motherfucker. Don't get on the ship. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9440.960000000001s)]
*  I'm going to want to go look at least on there. I bet. Well, yeah, of course, me too. We will get [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9446.0s)]
*  on the ships, but I'm going to say, hey, tell me before you all leave. No, dude, you will get on [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9451.52s)]
*  the ship for sure. I guarantee you'll get on the ship. I guarantee it will probably be podcasting [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9456.08s)]
*  on a spaceship at some point. I mean, maybe that is what we're on. Maybe that's part of it. They [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9460.32s)]
*  get you on the ship. They make you forget you're on a ship. They trick you into thinking you're in [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9467.44s)]
*  the human dimension. We're just in some cargo bay right now. Plugged into the matrix, baby. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9471.76s)]
*  That's awesome, man. Duncan, thanks so much for your time, dude. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9477.84s)]
*  Anytime, Theo. This is such a, so fun. Yeah, so fun, man. So fun to see you again. And yeah, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9485.76s)]
*  we should probably just do one to follow up this one. I think people will love this. This has been [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9492.8s)]
*  one of my favorite chats in a while, man. Dude, mine too. Thank you, Theo. I really [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9496.0s)]
*  think you're wonderful and thank you so much for having me on your show. It means the world. Thank [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9500.32s)]
*  you. Yeah, 100%, man. I want to do it again soon and we'll do yours. Yeah, we can just zoom it [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9503.76s)]
*  from wherever or come back in town. Wonderful. Yeah, I'll hit you up. Do you ever do them live? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9509.12s)]
*  I'm building a podcast studio right now, but it's slow going. You can talk to this company here, [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9517.44s)]
*  too. They're really good. You know, I'm tempted to, honestly, because I've been trying to do it at [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9522.48s)]
*  home and I'm just wondering if that's a little bit of what we were talking about earlier. You [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9526.56s)]
*  got to shed that skin. Why do you want to do it at home? What are you doing? Why not expand? Do it [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9531.52s)]
*  like you're doing? This is one of the things like you, Sigurra, Rogan, it's like, you know, you guys [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9537.92s)]
*  are real trendsetters. You're really leading the charge as far as creating your own TV show, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9543.12s)]
*  basically, and making it look good, having a nice studio and stuff. And I don't know, it just takes [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9548.24s)]
*  so much work. Yeah, well, I just started working with this company called Rooster Teeth and they've [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9553.2s)]
*  been awesome, man. It's been good. It's been really just interesting. And I'm glad that they've been [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9557.76s)]
*  supportive. But yeah, it is. I think, you know, there's something nice about having it at home. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9564.32s)]
*  It feels homey, but I think you feel homey no matter what, no matter where you would be. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9568.960000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I used to get, I started in my kitchen and I was like, oh, if I ever leave my kitchen, [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9575.52s)]
*  something will be wrong. I won't be able to communicate correctly or something. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9579.6s)]
*  That's how I feel. Yeah. Like I'm going to lose like the vibe of like, this is my garage. Like, [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9584.32s)]
*  this is my gritty podcast studio. Yeah. And it's like, that's so dumb. Like, why do I like, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9592.08s)]
*  I want to, I want to expand. It's just, geez, man. We need your voice out there. I think. Thanks, [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9599.92s)]
*  man. It's really good to hear. I've been really, I feel much better than when I came in today. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9604.08s)]
*  I feel more inspired. I feel, yeah, like I can do better when I communicate with people. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9609.6s)]
*  It's just a really nice reminder. You are a nice reminder of how to operate in the world. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9618.720000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Theo. Hey, man, we don't have to podcast. You can hit me up anytime you want. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9623.92s)]
*  If you just want to shoot the shit, I love talking to you and I would be thrilled. So thanks, man. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iv2WVZQZI&t=9628.16s)]
