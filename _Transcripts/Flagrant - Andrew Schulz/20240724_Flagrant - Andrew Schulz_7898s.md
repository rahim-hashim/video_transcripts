# Trump Survives & Kamala is Dems Hawk Tuah
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A)
*  Biden is out and Kamala is in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=0.0s)]
*  The election went from drool running to cool running faster than a female cop can fumble [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2.72s)]
*  her firearm. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Move over, RFK, this November we've got a new throat goat and apparently her headshots [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=8.6s)]
*  don't miss. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=13.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris, or as we call her, War Hawk Tua, the half-black, half-Indian parents met [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=14.72s)]
*  at a 7-Eleven robbery, is officially the Democratic nominee. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=20.8s)]
*  Surely the Dems, the party that calls Trump the end of democracy, surely they allowed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=25.32s)]
*  the voters to choose Kamala, right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=31.16s)]
*  What? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=33.2s)]
*  No? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=34.2s)]
*  Wait, there's no right to choose? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=35.2s)]
*  Guys, this is a presidential election, not a woman's body in Oklahoma. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=36.36s)]
*  Now, I don't want to seem like a flat-earthing dinosaur denying believe-all-women conspiracy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=39.8s)]
*  theorist, but it kind of feels like the Democrats dragged Biden's lifeless corpse through the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  enough to avoid a primary so they could place whoever they wanted as the nominee. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=52.08s)]
*  And that's about as Democratic as North Korea's Got Talent sidebar last year's winner, Ching [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=56.72s)]
*  Chong Chestnut, ate 36 rats. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=61.4s)]
*  Congratulations, Ching Chong. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=69.08s)]
*  That's a lot of rats. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=71.0s)]
*  We'll look forward to seeing how many you eat next year. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=72.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is they used a vegetable to install a plant, and honestly, we would have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=74.28s)]
*  been happier with a fruit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=79.24s)]
*  But the reality is it doesn't matter. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=80.76s)]
*  Last week, Trump became invincible, literally. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  He was leading before, and now he's number one with a bullet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=85.92s)]
*  At this point, if the Dems wanted to beat thrifty sent, they'd have to run George Washington, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  and Kamala could work for him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=93.48s)]
*  Paid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Paid. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, why is Trump invincible? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Because he has the power of hulking mania, obviously, brother, with a hard R, and also [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=99.64s)]
*  because this pimple-lipped pug-faced incel, we'll call him a trench bulldog, tried to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  make Trump's brain public domain. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=110.0s)]
*  Fortunately, even a bullet couldn't make Donald open-minded. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=112.12s)]
*  Now, getting a shot off at the president must be an incredibly difficult thing to accomplish. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=115.08s)]
*  I mean, not as difficult as finding binoculars to fit his eyes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=120.36s)]
*  Jesus, he looks like the sloth from Ice Age, but he must have designed a pretty ingenious [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=124.0s)]
*  plot to circumvent the Secret Service. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=128.56s)]
*  Oh, what's that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=130.88s)]
*  Wait, you're saying that Herpe Potter was just walking around with a loaded gun like [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=132.84s)]
*  he was on an Alec Baldwin set? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=136.86s)]
*  He was carrying a fucking ladder and a rangefinder? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=138.84s)]
*  He propped it up on a building that had cops in it, positioned himself on the roof with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=141.5s)]
*  a perfect sight line to the president, and no one did anything? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=145.04s)]
*  This Mickey Mouse security detail was so goofy it made Donald duck. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=148.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=152.36s)]
*  Who was in charge of the Secret Service, a lady? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=153.36s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=156.88s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=157.88s)]
*  Well, of course she didn't have anyone on top of the building. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=158.88s)]
*  Women only care about shots on the roof when there's a pool party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=160.96s)]
*  Now, I don't want to seem like a big foot tracking, moon landing denying Jews don't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=163.76s)]
*  control the weather conspiracy theorist, but it doesn't exactly feel like a 20 year old [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  fetal alcohol face McLovin should be able to infiltrate the most advanced security detail [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=173.32s)]
*  in history. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the only other thing he's penetrated was his palm. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  Did Kim Cheadle hire Epstein's Nyquil night watch? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  What the fuck is going on here? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=185.0s)]
*  This just doesn't feel right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=186.56s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  Nothing feels right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=190.48s)]
*  We have officially entered the post-truth age. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=192.56s)]
*  We can't trust the media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=195.26s)]
*  We can't trust the government. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=197.08s)]
*  We can't trust the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=198.34s)]
*  We can't even trust the food we eat. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=200.2s)]
*  So who can you trust? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=201.72s)]
*  Me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=203.52s)]
*  Your good friend, Chelsea. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=204.52s)]
*  This episode has been brought to you by Pfizer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=206.56s)]
*  There is no promo code. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=208.88s)]
*  There's nothing to fill out there already inside you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=210.08s)]
*  But before we bitch, whine and complain, just remember, like it or not, this is what we [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  ask for. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=217.88s)]
*  We wanted fast content that makes us feel good. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=219.1s)]
*  We want politicians who lie to us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=221.8s)]
*  We want sugary food to fill us up and pills to slim us down. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  We don't want what's good for us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=227.3s)]
*  We want what's convenient. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  So we made our bed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=230.28s)]
*  Might as well get comfy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=231.28s)]
*  Sleep tight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=233.28s)]
*  We are back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=234.28s)]
*  That was hard. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=235.28s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=236.28s)]
*  We are back. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=237.28s)]
*  We are back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=238.28s)]
*  We picked the hell of a week to take off. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=239.28s)]
*  Someone was telling me, I think it was Miles, that on Patreon we said, bro, this is crazy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=240.28s)]
*  How weird is that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  What exactly did we say? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  I think we opened Patreon by saying, hey, if we miss anything this week, our bad. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=249.84s)]
*  And then you said every Asian died, which that didn't happen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  And then we talked about Al being the Secret Service and that he would have to protect [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=257.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=261.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=262.5s)]
*  And then Al was like, I would only save Obama, I wouldn't save any other president. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=263.5s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=267.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=268.78s)]
*  Alex and that girl have the same MO. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=269.78s)]
*  They have the same energy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=271.46s)]
*  Al wouldn't have fumbled his gun. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  I would have stolen Trump's shoes for sure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=276.26s)]
*  He would have grabbed her shoes and been like, there's a lipstick. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=278.62s)]
*  No, when you go to the bathroom. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=280.62s)]
*  I don't want to throw the lipstick away. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=282.62s)]
*  Me too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=284.62s)]
*  Protect the shoes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=285.62s)]
*  That's a Gucci. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=286.62s)]
*  When he put the black fist, I would have joined him. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=289.62s)]
*  Okay, so let's catch ourselves up. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=293.62s)]
*  Obviously, last week we had a prerecorded episode, shout out to Shits and Gigs. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=299.62s)]
*  And then everything happened. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=300.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=302.62s)]
*  Literally everything happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=303.62s)]
*  Yeah, the world shut down. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=304.62s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=305.62s)]
*  We're talking about you going to the biggest wedding ever. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=307.02s)]
*  No. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=309.02s)]
*  So we got to get to that as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=310.02s)]
*  Akash was at the Ambani wedding. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=311.02s)]
*  Ambani wedding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=312.02s)]
*  Ambani wedding. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=313.02s)]
*  Yeah, Ambani wedding. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=314.02s)]
*  It sounds rich. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=315.02s)]
*  It does. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=316.02s)]

*  They were killing whites? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=390.82s)]

*  It's different. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=393.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=394.82s)]
*  So I was in a group chat. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=396.38s)]
*  And I was like, man, that shit is fake. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=397.38s)]
*  It was just so funny, the dynamic. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=400.26s)]
*  That was great. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=402.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=403.58s)]
*  So, the black group chat was like that shit is fake. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=404.58s)]
*  What was the white group chat saying, also are you a white group chat? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=406.3s)]
*  Yeah, you. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=408.96s)]
*  Were you a separate white group chat? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=409.96s)]
*  You have other white friends? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  Because my white guy, I still I'd be like, stay black every time I leave him. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  The only reason I thought that it was, it was immediately, I thought that it was, it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=422.74s)]
*  was, I'm not fake, I knew something was shot, but the sound, like, maybe I'm used to movie [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  sounds for guns. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=431.98s)]
*  I was like, New Yorkers don't know what guns sound like. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=432.98s)]
*  That's the thing, so we were like, BB gun, of course. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=435.7s)]
*  What are the, for the mosquitoes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=438.1s)]
*  The assault gun. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=439.94s)]
*  Yeah, the assault gun. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=440.94s)]
*  Because the sound was, this isn't like a booming rifle like what you hear. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  So I was like, okay, what exactly is happening? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=448.02s)]
*  I thought someone was shooting at them, but I didn't know what it was. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=449.62s)]
*  So that was initial. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=453.26s)]
*  And then I heard the glass hit his ear, and I was like, oh, that makes more sense. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=454.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=458.22s)]
*  Like, how does a bullet hit your ear? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=459.22s)]

*  Let him be Megan Thee Stallion, bro. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=466.22s)]
*  Listen, sometimes a ricochet counts as a bullet. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=467.22s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=472.22s)]

*  Now, yeah, oh, that's what they're saying. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=474.22s)]
*  Good. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=475.22s)]

*  Let him get shot. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=480.22s)]
*  Look at your ear. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=481.22s)]
*  He can't even be gangster. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=483.14000000000004s)]
*  He won't let Trump be gangster. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=484.14000000000004s)]

*  Miles would come back with a surgery looking amazing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  You look so good. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=542.9799999999999s)]
*  Giga Chad. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=543.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=544.9799999999999s)]
*  OK, so... [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=545.9799999999999s)]
*  That's what I thought at first. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=546.9799999999999s)]
*  I thought it was the glass. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=547.9799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh, maybe the bullet, like, ruptured his ear drum or some shit. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=548.9799999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=551.9799999999999s)]
*  And then now I'm like, nah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=552.9799999999999s)]
*  OK, so the knee-jerk reaction for a lot of people was, this can't be an actual assassination [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=553.9799999999999s)]
*  attempt. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  It's too crazy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=560.5799999999999s)]
*  It's too crazy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  Our generation has never really witnessed it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  We've only, like, kind of heard of it, imagined it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=564.3s)]
*  And got hit. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=566.9s)]
*  That's the craziest part. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=567.9s)]
*  That's the craziest part. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=569.74s)]
*  So, and also, I think that we're, like, so detached from reality at this point. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=570.74s)]
*  Like, we really, just like we were saying in the rant in the beginning, it's like we [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=574.74s)]
*  really just don't believe anything. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=577.86s)]
*  I'm just sensitized to all of it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=578.86s)]
*  My first thought, honestly, was liberals really can't do nothing right. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=580.02s)]
*  Like, y'all fucking fail every time and everything. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  Because the gravity of it didn't even sink in. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=587.02s)]
*  Because we just see all this crazy shit. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  So it's like, man, y'all fucked this up, too? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=590.98s)]
*  How y'all missy? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=592.98s)]
*  I don't ruin everything. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=593.98s)]
*  That's all I thought. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=594.98s)]
*  I just moved on. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=595.98s)]
*  It needs your jump to, it must have been a liberal. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  Or if just, yeah, then second thought was, maybe it's fake. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=599.62s)]
*  Maybe this ensures the election win for him. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  This is going to embol— [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=603.78s)]
*  Because the way he raised his fucking fist up in the air, it was so hard. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=604.78s)]
*  I was like, I can't imagine that being real. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=608.66s)]
*  That was my first thought. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  It had to be fake because he was too cool afterwards. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  I thought if I would do it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  Like, I thought if I would sit back up, or stand back up and, like, try to take in the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=616.86s)]
*  moment and— [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=622.9s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=624.9s)]
*  Bro, I had to sleep over once in my apartment when I was young in high school. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  And there was a shooting in the parking lot outside my apartment. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=631.02s)]
*  And we dropped to the floor and we was walking around. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=636.78s)]
*  I'm in an apartment building, we're here and there's a shooting next to us. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=639.18s)]
*  It's not like there isn't even a window the bullet could come in. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=643.1s)]
*  But the rest of the night. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=645.66s)]
*  But we're crawling like this to the bathroom, going to my parents' room. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=647.22s)]
*  That's how terrified of the bullets. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=650.66s)]
*  This guy got shot at, clipped, grabbed his insoles, and then stood up the extra two inches, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  raised his hand, and then kept it moving. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=661.26s)]
*  That was— [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, baller. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, how could you be so secure that, especially given America's history, there's multiple [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  shooters. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=670.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=671.5799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=672.5799999999999s)]
*  Like, you know the history. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=673.5799999999999s)]
*  You looked at the JFK file. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=674.62s)]
*  You know that there was three different people, someone in the null, someone in the building. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=675.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe even this one. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=679.14s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=680.9s)]
*  There's some acoustic shit that apparently two, maybe even three— [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=681.9s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=685.26s)]
*  I didn't hear that one. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=686.26s)]
*  That was an experience. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=687.26s)]
*  And then apparently Kim Cheadle didn't even deny. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=688.26s)]
*  They were like, was he a lone shooter? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=690.1800000000001s)]
*  And she basically said something to the fact. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  We were pulling up. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  She was like, I, you know, she just basically reiterated what her original comment was, but [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=694.3000000000001s)]
*  kind of chose not to answer whether or not it was a lone shooter. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=697.62s)]
*  Kim Cheadle is the director of the Secret Service. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=699.78s)]
*  Former. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=702.34s)]
*  Former, that's right. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=703.34s)]
*  She just resigned. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=704.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=705.34s)]
*  So, okay, the disbelief. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=706.34s)]
*  I think there were some people that didn't believe it because they just fucking hate [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=707.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=710.66s)]
*  And they saw that this was going to be something that really benefited him because he looks [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=713.02s)]
*  fucking majestic. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=716.98s)]
*  I mean, unbelievable. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=717.98s)]
*  You gotta give it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=718.98s)]
*  The picture is crazy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=719.98s)]
*  If I'm framed, that's his next NFT. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=720.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's an album called that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=723.18s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=725.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's just making a hundred million off the chip. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=726.3s)]
*  Crazy thing, Miles even told me the guy that took that photo also took the photo of George [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=727.54s)]
*  Bush when he found out that the World Trade Center got hit. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=732.8199999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=735.18s)]
*  He's in on it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=736.18s)]
*  Whispering in his ear. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=737.26s)]
*  He's in on it, bro, because if you're at both of those moments and you have the defining [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=738.26s)]
*  picture or video evidence. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=741.9799999999999s)]
*  Or he's just a good ass photographer. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=743.4599999999999s)]
*  Or he's in the hair. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=745.4599999999999s)]
*  Why does he have a mouse up? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=746.4599999999999s)]
*  He's in the school in Florida. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  He's at a school in Florida? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=748.4599999999999s)]
*  If a fucking president is showing up to a school, you send fucking news there to take [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=750.3s)]
*  pictures. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=753.9s)]
*  Oh, they called him. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=754.9s)]
*  They called him. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=755.9s)]
*  They said, line up right here. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=756.9s)]
*  Okay, now I have that flag flying. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=757.9s)]
*  Clip him in the... [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=758.9s)]
*  That guy's a baller. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=759.9s)]
*  Like, we're talking about Trump coming up after a shot. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=760.9s)]
*  That guy was standing there back to the shooter. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=763.16s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=764.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=765.9s)]
*  That's because he knew it wasn't him. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=767.62s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=768.62s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=769.62s)]
*  But yeah, kind of a crazy photo. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=770.62s)]
*  Okay, so, you know, a weird thing also happens when someone gets shot and survives is like [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=773.62s)]
*  anything that they've done before that, you forget about. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=778.4599999999999s)]
*  Like after he got shot, stood back up, pumped the fist and came back out. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=782.22s)]
*  I think it was even the next day he went golfing or something. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=788.34s)]
*  I was like, I think I'm a Republican. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=790.5s)]
*  Yo, Elon came out and donated the 42 million a month. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=795.18s)]
*  Did you see this? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  So he came out, he's like, I fully endorse Donald Trump. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  I am donating $42 million a month to his campaign. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=803.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=806.2199999999999s)]
*  How did Elon get on Patreon? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=807.2199999999999s)]
*  How did we get him to subscribe? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=808.2199999999999s)]
*  45 million a month. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=809.2199999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you how. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=810.2199999999999s)]
*  We just got to say, end puberty blockers and stuff. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=811.2199999999999s)]
*  But he made that tweet, like a declaration, oh, I'm back in trouble. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, nigga, we know he's back. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=820.3s)]
*  So this is the thing that a shooting does, or surviving a shooting does. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=824.06s)]
*  It's a permission slip for all the people that were secretly Trump supporters to come [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=829.14s)]
*  out. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=833.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's where the benefit is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=834.4599999999999s)]
*  Like the benefit is not like, I don't think there's someone that saw the shooting that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=835.4599999999999s)]
*  was like, actually I will vote for him. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=837.4599999999999s)]
*  I think it's now you can see all the people in the public support him. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=839.06s)]
*  I saw a baseball player, like they hit a base hit and just hit the fight. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=841.66s)]
*  They hit the fight or they go like this and they tap their ear. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=845.54s)]
*  I think they do that in baseball. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=848.5799999999999s)]
*  I think that's just a call. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=849.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=850.5799999999999s)]
*  That's a fast ball. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=851.5799999999999s)]
*  But like now you just see him, bro. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=852.58s)]
*  I thought I never heard that. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=853.58s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=854.58s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=855.58s)]
*  They're shouting out the don'ts. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=856.58s)]
*  It's true, man. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=857.58s)]
*  It's true. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=858.58s)]
*  It's true. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=859.58s)]
*  It's true. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=860.58s)]
*  But now you get to see people like mask off supporting him. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=861.58s)]
*  And that I think is going to do way more for him. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's because he's viewed as a victim. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=865.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think that you could take that victim narrative and you could also turn into, well, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=868.94s)]
*  if they, whoever they is, is trying to kill him because it was suspicious. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=872.26s)]
*  The circumstances were incredibly suspicious. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=876.5400000000001s)]
*  So it is easy for you to go down the line of thinking that maybe there was an organization [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=879.7s)]
*  or a group of people that wanted him out of here. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=884.7800000000001s)]
*  And if you go down that line of thinking, you're like, well, if they want him out of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=887.98s)]
*  here, what the hell is he planning on doing that these people want him out of here? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=891.7s)]
*  And if these people are these nefarious individuals that are the deep state or ruling the country [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=897.22s)]
*  or whatever, I definitely don't like them. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=901.1800000000001s)]
*  Man, I got to support this guy to get those guys the fuck out. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=902.7800000000001s)]
*  It's real. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=905.58s)]
*  Everything he's been saying is real. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=906.58s)]
*  All that drain the swamp shit. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=907.58s)]
*  It must be real because they want to kill him. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=908.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it confirms every... [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=909.86s)]
*  And this is what we talked about on the call. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=911.1800000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned the post-truth era. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=913.62s)]
*  Whatever you want to believe, this one allows you to believe. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=915.62s)]
*  If you hate Trump and you think he's a weak candidate and he knows even if Biden is old, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=917.86s)]
*  he'll still probably lose. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=923.14s)]
*  This year, you're like, oh, he did this. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=924.7800000000001s)]
*  So he can win the... [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=926.5400000000001s)]
*  How does a bullet graze you? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=927.5400000000001s)]
*  You drop to the ground, then we see the blood. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=928.5400000000001s)]
*  You could very easily have whatever you want to believe. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=930.46s)]
*  This lends itself to it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=934.82s)]
*  It's the perfect... [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=936.0200000000001s)]
*  That's what we talked about. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=937.0200000000001s)]
*  Why is there so much conspiracy theorists? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=938.02s)]
*  Whatever you want to believe, this allows you to believe. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=939.8199999999999s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=942.46s)]
*  I like that everyone's on the conspiracy train now. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=943.46s)]
*  It's just so nice. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=944.9399999999999s)]
*  It's getting a little hacky. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=945.9399999999999s)]
*  It was just right wing people. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=946.9399999999999s)]
*  You don't feel a little bit like y'all are making a hacky? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=947.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, now we're switching up. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  Now you got to do the reality theories. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=950.9399999999999s)]
*  CNN is right. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  I believe all of it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=955.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  But that is true. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=957.9399999999999s)]
*  We have so much information available to us that you can satisfy whatever theory you have. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=958.9399999999999s)]
*  It could be conspiracy, it could be reality. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=964.5799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter what it is. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=966.14s)]
*  There's enough information to show that there were multiple shooters. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=967.26s)]
*  So now the idea that like, let's say the FBI or the CIA or some organization was involved [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=971.66s)]
*  in this, let's just say, allegedly, whatever, was involved in this, that's not even enough. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=978.8199999999999s)]
*  They didn't hire this lone wolf and then kill the patsy. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=985.58s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=987.54s)]
*  There was three different people that did it and they all somehow miss, which makes [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=988.54s)]
*  no sense. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=992.5s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=993.5s)]
*  If that's what you want to believe, there's enough information for you to go out there [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=994.86s)]
*  and get it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=996.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=997.98s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if we're built for all this information. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=998.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=999.98s)]
*  Well, maybe we're the first generation with it and it's like the first generation of people [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1000.98s)]
*  who smoke cigarettes where they're like, yeah, this can't be bad. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1005.1s)]
*  Dax Shepard said that one time. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1008.1s)]
*  He's like, when we grew up, we were eating so much sugary junk food. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1009.58s)]
*  We had no idea how bad it was for us. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1013.3s)]
*  It's all fucking processed and fake and artificial. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1014.78s)]
*  And now we're wising up and we're learning how to use that wisely. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1016.94s)]
*  He thinks the same thing will happen with technology. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1020.3s)]
*  Right now we're taking all of it in. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1022.5s)]
*  We don't know how bad it is for us. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1024.02s)]
*  We're going to start to learn and then evolve and figure out how to use it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1025.26s)]
*  So we're the generation that's going to have to deal with it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  Maybe the kids can discern between like real news and fake news, and maybe they just don't [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1029.9s)]
*  subscribe to any of it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1033.46s)]
*  But us, we're the people getting, you know, taking advantage by the Nigerian credit card [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1035.54s)]
*  scams. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1039.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1040.34s)]
*  We're literally, with everything we read, every headline that satisfies my feelings, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1041.34s)]
*  I'm, yes, that's what it was. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1044.42s)]
*  And it's only getting worse, dude. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1045.42s)]
*  Have you seen the AI videos after Biden dropped out, which we'll get to the AI videos of him [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1046.42s)]
*  being like just cussing out the camera and stuff like that? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1049.94s)]
*  The dubbing is off, but everything else looks perfect. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1052.6599999999999s)]
*  And they're going to get the dubbing better and better. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1055.1799999999998s)]
*  It's going to get to the point where we're like, I don't even know what's real and what's [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1057.1s)]
*  not. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1059.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1060.78s)]
*  Now, I was thinking if the bullet doesn't hit Trump, if he's not bleeding, does it, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1061.78s)]
*  does anyone care? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1066.1799999999998s)]
*  Like, is it just like, oh, there was some shots fired and then people can deny it? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1067.1799999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1071.7399999999998s)]
*  RIP, the firemen died. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1072.7399999999998s)]
*  There was a casualty. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1076.82s)]
*  I think if there's no casualty, then people like, there was no point. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1077.82s)]
*  I think people, I agree with you. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1080.86s)]
*  I think there's enough plausible deniability that it even happened at all. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1083.1s)]
*  But the fact that the dude died, that's when all the people that were trying to discredit [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1087.3s)]
*  Trump, that's when they start to pump the brakes. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1091.1799999999998s)]
*  They're like, wait a minute, there's an actual death here. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1093.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1096.62s)]
*  I was even looking at it like there's a thing in history like FDR got shot or got shot at. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1097.62s)]
*  Nothing hit him and hit the mayor behind him and killed the mayor. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  But we don't even remember. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1105.8999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't even come up. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1106.8999999999999s)]
*  It's not even a bullet. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1107.8999999999999s)]
*  I never knew he got shot. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1108.8999999999999s)]
*  It didn't hit him and missed him and hit the mayor. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1109.94s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1110.94s)]
*  Which there's a whole conspiracy about that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1111.94s)]
*  I'll spare you. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1112.94s)]
*  Wait, wait, tell us. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1113.94s)]
*  People think it was the mob that set up the hit and that it was never supposed to hit [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1114.94s)]
*  FDR in the first place. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1117.7800000000002s)]
*  That it was supposed to hit the mayor behind him who was Mayor Cermak of Chicago and that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1118.7800000000002s)]
*  the Chicago mob hired this guy to take out the mayor. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1122.66s)]
*  And so they killed the mayor and that was what it was intentionally supposed to do because [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1125.66s)]
*  FDR spoke for like 10, 15 minutes and no bullets came. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1128.5800000000002s)]
*  And then as soon as the mayor came up, that's when he shot him. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1131.6200000000001s)]
*  And apparently the guy used to be like a high ranking Italian military member. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1133.42s)]
*  But why would they try to kill the mayor in the most difficult way possible? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1137.58s)]
*  Because he was around. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1142.34s)]
*  It was like a challenge. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1143.34s)]
*  He was public. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1144.34s)]
*  But I'm just saying you can get to a mayor like with the mayors near the president, it's [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1145.34s)]
*  going to be the greatest security detail you've ever seen. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1147.34s)]
*  If the mayor is not with the president, we used to see Bloomberg on the subway. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1149.8999999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1152.9399999999998s)]

*  He would take the subway to work. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1155.9399999999998s)]
*  Apparently that's what that's what's crazy. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1156.9399999999998s)]
*  That's a story. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1157.9399999999998s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1158.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, shouts. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1159.9399999999998s)]
*  At the time, he was like enough where he could take it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1160.9399999999998s)]
*  No, he's still respected. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1163.4199999999998s)]
*  Like to work for the end people were like, yeah, you're doing you pump the bridge, you're [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1165.74s)]
*  doing too much. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1168.94s)]
*  But like when he was trying to like change New York with sodas and shit. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1169.94s)]
*  That was the straw. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1174.7s)]
*  I'm really upset about that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1177.7s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1179.18s)]

*  He had a shaky hand. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1383.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1384.18s)]
*  We know that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1385.18s)]
*  We know that much to be true. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1386.18s)]
*  Marking, though. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1388.18s)]
*  It's not crazy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1389.18s)]
*  Anywho. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1391.6200000000001s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1392.6200000000001s)]
*  No social media posts. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1393.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  Like, has more Black Rock commercials than Instagram. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1395.6200000000001s)]
*  What fucking world? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1398.6200000000001s)]
*  There's no other pictures of him other than him saying he's got a 10 inch dick? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1400.6200000000001s)]
*  Registered Republican. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1403.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1404.6200000000001s)]
*  Donated to the Democrats. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1405.6200000000001s)]
*  I heard something about this. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1406.6200000000001s)]
*  Go. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1407.6200000000001s)]
*  So apparently the theory, again, this is just some shit I read online, that he was a registered [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  Republican so he could vote against Trump in the primal. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1412.14s)]
*  That happens a lot. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1414.46s)]
*  Like in Orange County, if you're a Democrat in Orange County that's always going to go [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1415.46s)]
*  Republican. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1418.74s)]
*  You basically register as a Republican so you can vote for what you believe to be the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1419.74s)]
*  lesser of two evils. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1423.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1424.94s)]
*  So I saw it and I was like, wait, he was a Republican first in January and then donated [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1425.94s)]
*  to Act Blue in like September or some shit. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1429.5s)]
*  And I was like, this makes no sense. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1431.42s)]
*  But now if he's voting against Trump, then it's more consistent. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1433.34s)]
*  Mind you, he's 20 so he just got the right to vote. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1435.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1438.9s)]
*  Donated under 18, I think. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1439.9s)]
*  But still, it's on paper, the perfect person to convince to do this. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1443.58s)]
*  Because if you're a registered Republican, but you've also donated to the Democrats, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1451.06s)]
*  America can't tear itself in two because you can't exactly pinpoint that this was just [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1455.5s)]
*  like an insane liberal that digested all the rhetoric about how Trump is actually Hitler [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1460.06s)]
*  and he thought that he had to do the heroic thing and take him out. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1465.06s)]
*  Now we're confused about what his real intentions are. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1468.1s)]
*  Is he a diehard conservative and he think that Trump's taking the party? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1470.74s)]
*  A conservative wouldn't have missed. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1474.18s)]
*  What are we talking about, dog? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1475.18s)]
*  That guy would have been at target practice. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1476.18s)]
*  Have you seen people throwing trans on? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1478.18s)]
*  People are throwing trans on the shooter. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1480.18s)]
*  Like there's like an early rumor right when it happened. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1481.8600000000001s)]
*  They're like, oh, he's a trans shooter. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1485.7s)]
*  And then they just found some random trans chick and they're like, that's the one. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1486.7s)]
*  Yep. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1490.5s)]
*  That's fire. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1491.5s)]
*  I wonder if he's in hell being like. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1492.5s)]
*  Elon's Twitter is cracking. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1493.5s)]
*  He's on it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1494.5s)]
*  The shooter's like, yo, I'm trying to kill the president. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1495.5s)]
*  I'm not trans. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1499.38s)]
*  Yeah, realistic here. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1500.38s)]
*  He's sultring my looks. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1504.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1506.38s)]
*  I mean, it is crazy. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1507.38s)]
*  He looks like every school shooter ever. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1508.38s)]
*  That we didn't have that conversation. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1509.38s)]
*  There was like a casting for him. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1511.38s)]
*  There was like, we need a school shooter look. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1512.38s)]
*  Who do we go to? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1514.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1515.38s)]
*  Open call. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1516.38s)]
*  That's the kid. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1517.38s)]
*  I'm a beard away from being a school shooter. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1518.38s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1519.38s)]
*  No, you don't look like a beard. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1520.38s)]

*  You got too much of a tan. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1528.38s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1529.38s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1533.38s)]
*  But it's so distinct what they look like that I think that we need to stop being so polite [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1534.38s)]
*  about them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1541.0600000000002s)]
*  Like, you know, in the way that like, we're kind of, I mean, no longer, but white people [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1542.0600000000002s)]
*  weren't polite with black people. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1549.38s)]
*  Like they cross the street. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1550.38s)]
*  They changed the perks. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1551.38s)]
*  Yeah, the slavery thing. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1552.38s)]
*  Also the slavery thing. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1553.38s)]
*  But like, there was like a fear of them. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1554.38s)]
*  They're like, uh-oh. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1555.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1556.7800000000002s)]

*  I knew who the school shooter was in my school. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1559.18s)]
*  He didn't end up doing it, but they found a list of people he said he wanted to kill. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1561.26s)]
*  I talk about him on the pot all the time. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1564.7s)]

*  But we have this ingenious system where they randomly select the people that do the fucking [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1634.78s)]
*  crime. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1639.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1640.3400000000001s)]
*  So if we apply that to the school shooters, which I'm sure you knew one in your fucking [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1641.3400000000001s)]
*  school, you knew one in your fucking school. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1644.62s)]
*  My home school? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1646.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1647.62s)]
*  You knew which one of your brothers and sisters were blown the fuck up. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1648.62s)]
*  I got it on my head right now. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1651.62s)]
*  It's fucking you, Martin. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1653.62s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1654.62s)]
*  It's fucking you. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1655.62s)]
*  It's not, bro. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1656.62s)]
*  My point is we could apply a little bit more prejudice to these kids. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1657.62s)]
*  It's never a surprise. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1660.9s)]
*  Whenever it happens, there's never all the friends that go, I couldn't believe this fucking [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1662.58s)]
*  happened every single time. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1665.34s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I kind of thought he was going to do it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1667.74s)]
*  Say something. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1670.9s)]
*  What is it? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1671.9s)]
*  See something, say something. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1672.9s)]
*  Snitch. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1674.7800000000002s)]
*  Call the cops the second you see them. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1675.7800000000002s)]
*  I think it should be more. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1678.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1679.0600000000002s)]
*  We need the referral system. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1680.0600000000002s)]
*  Also, if you're a Twitch streamer and you think that you fucking touch kids, like, let's [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1681.0600000000002s)]

*  Let's go. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1687.3000000000002s)]
*  You know more of this. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1688.3000000000002s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1689.3000000000002s)]
*  Like just call the cops. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1690.3000000000002s)]
*  We're swatting the wrong people. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1691.3000000000002s)]
*  Swat. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1693.3000000000002s)]
*  School shooters. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1694.3000000000002s)]
*  All of them. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1695.3000000000002s)]
*  Swat, swat, swat. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1696.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but you said you had fun with the one that would have been the shooter in your [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1697.3000000000002s)]
*  school. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1701.02s)]
*  So you snitch on them. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1702.1399999999999s)]
*  Now you get rid of the kid. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  Alex, I saved the school. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1704.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you realize I saved the school? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1705.1399999999999s)]
*  If it was up to Jamil, we would all been dead. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1707.66s)]
*  Jamil was torturing this little motherfucker. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1710.66s)]
*  Me, I was just tickling him and shit so he could, you know, make the choice. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1713.66s)]
*  He still made the list. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1717.66s)]
*  Say again? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1718.66s)]
*  He still had a list. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1719.66s)]
*  Once he started the list, then I had to be like, bro, okay, come on. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1720.66s)]
*  We can do that though. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1722.66s)]
*  We could have a community resource officer that's in charge of tickling all the school [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1723.66s)]
*  shooters at every school and that would still lead them off. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1726.5s)]
*  That shit works, bro. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1730.1399999999999s)]
*  Leave it love. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1731.26s)]
*  Tickling a motherfucker that wants to shoot you? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1732.26s)]
*  That shit works. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1734.26s)]
*  If the cops got up on that roof and they're like, there's no way that this goes down. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1735.26s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1740.5800000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1741.5800000000002s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1742.5800000000002s)]
*  I think we need to do this. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1743.5800000000002s)]
*  Send them into schools, tickle all school shooters. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1744.5800000000002s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1751.5800000000002s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, so we're going to do something about them. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1752.5800000000002s)]
*  We all know who it is. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  You know who's in your school. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1754.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, that doesn't mean that they are going to do it, but they're the ones that [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1755.5800000000002s)]
*  are closest to doing it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1757.46s)]
*  And we need to just go to the teacher, just be like, yo, that motherfucker's weird. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1759.1s)]
*  Let's stop playing. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1761.62s)]
*  Let's stop playing. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1762.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1763.62s)]
*  It's actually on us if we have more school shooters. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1764.62s)]
*  That's true. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1766.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1767.4599999999998s)]
*  Like it like. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1768.4599999999998s)]
*  We need gun control. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1769.4599999999998s)]
*  We need crazy control. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1770.4599999999998s)]
*  You can't have one without the other. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1771.4599999999998s)]
*  And it's not like the women should like, you know, why'd you dress that way? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1772.4599999999998s)]
*  Like when they get to whatever. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1774.62s)]
*  But when the school gets shot up, it is that way. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1776.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1779.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1780.2199999999998s)]
*  We take both seriously. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1781.2199999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1782.2199999999998s)]
*  Like you knew today we're going to do it because the way he dressed. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1783.2199999999998s)]
*  He was in camo pants and apparently had body odor. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1786.22s)]
*  The body odor is a dead good smell. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1789.82s)]
*  That sounds like you, to be honest. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1791.82s)]
*  No, no. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1792.82s)]
*  No, no. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1793.82s)]
*  Every one of them don't fucking clean themselves, bro. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1794.82s)]
*  They should have known he was coming, bro. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1796.82s)]
*  They should have smelled him or something. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1798.82s)]
*  It's a real issue. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1799.82s)]
*  Smell something, say something. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1800.82s)]
*  Smell something, say something. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1801.82s)]
*  If there's a kid in your school who smells bad and he doesn't have enough friends to [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1802.82s)]
*  tell him to put on the odor. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1808.14s)]
*  And he's not an immigrant. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1809.14s)]
*  You're fucking dead. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1810.14s)]
*  Yeah, he can't be an immigrant. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1811.14s)]
*  Immigrants aren't shooters. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1812.14s)]
*  And they shoot her all the way in the head. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1813.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1814.14s)]
*  Listen, lump them in. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1816.0600000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1819.0600000000002s)]

*  Maybe they're like, I think he's going to shoot at the school. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1822.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's like, no, he just needs the odor. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1824.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's like, all right. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1825.0600000000002s)]
*  A win is a win. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1826.0600000000002s)]
*  That's a good stigma. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1827.0600000000002s)]
*  Then we're going to have less 7-elevens and shit like that. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1828.0600000000002s)]
*  Say again? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1829.0600000000002s)]
*  We're going to have less 7-elevens of this bitch. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1830.0600000000002s)]
*  But the young Indians don't stink, bro. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1831.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they get fades and shit. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1833.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1835.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1836.0600000000002s)]
*  They got black girlfriends. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1837.0600000000002s)]

*  The immigrants just grew up in a place where there's much more smell so they just fit in. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1839.0600000000002s)]

*  I'm calling you out, son. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1846.98s)]
*  I'm calling you out, son. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1847.98s)]
*  The movie's coming out. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1848.98s)]
*  They announced the movie. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1849.98s)]
*  Nah, you fade your shit back. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1850.98s)]
*  What do I have to do? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1851.98s)]
*  I have to bring it back? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1852.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1853.98s)]
*  That shit was fire. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1854.98s)]
*  So once I saw that shit go viral, did you see the kid get in the hair cut? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1855.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1858.98s)]
*  Once I saw that shit go viral, I was like, nah, I got to fade this motherfucker. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1859.98s)]
*  I can't let this actually become a trend. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1862.98s)]
*  I can't let this actually become a trend. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1865.98s)]
*  I can't let this actually become a trend. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1869.9s)]
*  That kid's going to be responsible for it, not me. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1872.9s)]
*  The fact that his last search on his phone was porn. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1875.9s)]
*  Respect, though. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1878.9s)]
*  What else are you going to do? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1879.9s)]
*  Just let it out. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1880.9s)]
*  Do we know what the video was that made him shoot a president? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1881.9s)]
*  I need to see what porn is. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1884.9s)]
*  I think it was Lisa Ann as Palin. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1886.9s)]
*  It was a classic. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1889.9s)]
*  Now, do we know the video? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1891.9s)]
*  No, I don't know if they put it up. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1893.9s)]
*  If you're going to go through with it post-nut clarity, he really meant it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1896.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1899.8200000000002s)]
*  He wanted to not do it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1900.8200000000002s)]
*  If it's Stormy Daniels, how dare he do it to this angel? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1902.8200000000002s)]
*  I got to defend this woman's honor. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1907.8200000000002s)]
*  The real white knight. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1910.8200000000002s)]
*  The real white knight ever. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1912.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1914.8200000000002s)]
*  So now we have it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1916.8200000000002s)]
*  So probably the stuff on the phone, was he planning? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1917.8200000000002s)]
*  Was there stuff on the phone? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1920.8200000000002s)]
*  We're never going to see that phone. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1922.8200000000002s)]
*  We're never going to see the obscene list. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1923.8200000000002s)]
*  They said he searched Trump, Biden, DNC. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1925.74s)]
*  R&C. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1928.74s)]
*  A lot of important people are thinking he also searched former military people. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1929.74s)]
*  But no planning of the situation. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1933.74s)]
*  Not that I've seen. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1935.74s)]
*  Not that I've seen either. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1936.74s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1937.74s)]
*  Well, it just gets weirder because R&C happens. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1938.74s)]
*  R&C is a banger. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1941.74s)]
*  The clips from R&C go crazy. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1943.74s)]
*  It does feel like WrestleMania. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1946.74s)]
*  I'm not saying that just because the Hulk was there, but also the fact that when you [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1947.74s)]
*  have someone that can move, like political audiences are always the easiest to move because [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1951.66s)]
*  you just say the talking point, they go crazy. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1954.66s)]
*  But then when you match like a God given talent to move an audience, which obviously Hulk [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1957.66s)]
*  has, with the talking points, tearing open the shirt. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1963.66s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1968.66s)]
*  He ripped an American flag. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1969.66s)]
*  Like his shirt had an American flag on it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1971.66s)]
*  And he ripped it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1974.66s)]
*  And I was like, wait a second. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1975.66s)]
*  Hold on now. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1976.66s)]
*  Isn't that part of the whole thing? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1977.66s)]
*  Hold on now. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1978.66s)]
*  We got to look into it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1979.66s)]
*  Everybody's like an eagle and shit. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1981.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we got to look into it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1982.5800000000002s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1984.5800000000002s)]
*  But I'm surprised Trump let people outshine him though. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1985.5800000000002s)]
*  Because like his actual speech I heard was like, okay, I'm a snooze fit. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1987.5800000000002s)]
*  So the speech was mid, but I thought that that was kind of brilliant. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1991.5800000000002s)]
*  It's like he, I was hoping he wouldn't make the mistake he made last time, which is essentially [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1994.5800000000002s)]
*  when he's, he's a great, what is it called? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=1999.5800000000002s)]
*  Like chaser. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2002.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, like what is that? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2003.5800000000002s)]
*  The pre-fontaine. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2006.5800000000002s)]
*  Did you guys watch that pre-fontaine running movie? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2007.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2008.5800000000002s)]
*  Like he was like a front runner. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2009.5800000000002s)]
*  He was like a way ahead. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2011.5s)]
*  But like in running, it's actually most effective to be right behind the person so you can like [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2012.5s)]
*  draft them. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2014.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2015.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2016.98s)]
*  And so when he was chasing in that first election. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2017.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2020.98s)]
*  Underdog. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2021.98s)]
*  Underdog unstoppable. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2022.98s)]
*  And then when he was not as a front runner, it was hard for him to do it because the same [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2023.98s)]
*  rhetoric just seems like bullying. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2027.4199999999998s)]
*  When you're the underdog, you talking that shit. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2028.8999999999999s)]
*  When you're on top and you're doing it, it's just bullying. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2031.1399999999999s)]
*  So when he gave the mid speech at the RNC, all he needed to do was show up. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2033.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2037.98s)]
*  That's really all he needed to do to be heroic. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2038.98s)]
*  Like he was shot a couple of days before and now he's out there, you know, with the tampon [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2040.1s)]
*  on his head. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2043.34s)]
*  And when the speech was mid, I was like, oh, he's actually playing this really well. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2044.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2050.1s)]
*  It was nice to see him get emotional. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2051.1s)]
*  Like seeing him get emotional was like, whoa. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2052.1s)]
*  Only time I've ever seen him genuinely smile is when Hulk was doing his thing. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2054.38s)]
*  There's a great clip where it cuts away. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2060.82s)]
*  You never see Trump smile, by the way. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2062.7s)]
*  Genuinely. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2064.98s)]
*  You never see him laugh. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2065.98s)]
*  You can't describe his laugh. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2068.26s)]
*  Never heard it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2070.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2071.6600000000003s)]
*  Never heard it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2072.6600000000003s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why he's so funny because he never breaks, in my opinion, because [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2073.6600000000003s)]
*  he never breaks. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2079.26s)]
*  So everything he does, you think is serious. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2080.5800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2083.5400000000004s)]
*  So even the things he's doing sarcastically, you're like, is he serious? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2084.98s)]
*  You never see him just laugh or chuckle. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2088.1400000000003s)]
*  And when Hulk is, when the Hulkster, when the Trumpamania comes for you, and it cuts [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2090.5s)]
*  So to him, he goes, and he clearly has this like human moment. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2095.94s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2101.46s)]
*  Gives this kind of mid-speech. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2102.46s)]
*  He's talking about unity and it's like, oh my God, it's his. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2104.38s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2106.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2107.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, you've heard him on the phone with RFK. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2108.6600000000003s)]
*  The RFK convo. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2109.6600000000003s)]
*  You guys heard that? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2110.6600000000003s)]
*  I haven't heard this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2111.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like, it's a different Trump, in my opinion. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2112.6600000000003s)]
*  You hear Trump on stage and you just like, this crazy energy, never really breaks, all [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2114.9s)]
*  the same shit. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2119.26s)]
*  And he's on the phone with RFK and he's like, yeah, Biden called me. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2120.26s)]
*  I'm a nice guy. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2122.98s)]
*  I'm a nice guy. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2124.38s)]
*  Yeah, nice guy. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2125.38s)]
*  And I was talking trash about his policies. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2126.38s)]
*  Oh, I didn't want to, I didn't have the heart to tell him. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2127.38s)]
*  But anyway, vaccines cause autism. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2129.38s)]
*  This is apparently like what he's like in person. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2131.18s)]
*  Like makes you feel like a superstar, love bombed. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2134.14s)]
*  But it was just like so charming on the phone. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2136.38s)]
*  And he was saying that he's like, RFK, yeah, I think we need to look into the vaccine. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2138.06s)]
*  Why don't you drop out and I'll have a place for you. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2140.94s)]
*  You can start looking through this stuff. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2143.46s)]
*  Like that I can understand because prior to being president, he was liked by a lot of [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2144.94s)]
*  people. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2148.98s)]
*  So it's like, I can see behind the scenes. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2149.98s)]
*  He's actually a hundred percent. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2151.58s)]
*  I mean, those guys are brilliant at maneuvering period. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2153.34s)]
*  So he knows how to move large crowds. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2156.34s)]
*  He knows how to move one person. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2157.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2159.46s)]
*  It's like a brilliant level of charisma. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2160.02s)]
*  Yeah. Social savant. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2162.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2163.18s)]
*  Anyway, so. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2164.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, OK, he's got this. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2166.7s)]
*  And then immediately after that, Biden gets covid. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2168.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you guys think Biden has covid? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2172.18s)]
*  I do think he was sick. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2173.86s)]
*  He trying to speedy covid, you think? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2174.86s)]
*  Is that what's going on? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2176.66s)]
*  We got to look into that. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2177.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2178.14s)]
*  I'm going to say it is amazing timing that he would get covid, which would force him [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2178.74s)]
*  to step down. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2186.74s)]
*  Well, he hasn't blamed covid yet, is the thing, has he? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2187.9399999999996s)]
*  No. Well, it just stopped him from making public appearances. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2190.74s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2193.8599999999997s)]
*  And so immediately after the peak of Trump's fame, he gets covid and he's fucking 81 years [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2195.1s)]
*  old. You're like, oh, is this going to take him out? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2203.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Like, is that how you top Trump? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2205.9799999999996s)]
*  Just Obama sit him down and be like, Joe, we need you to die. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2208.1s)]
*  There's only one way that we can get the energy back here and you got to fucking croak. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2211.9s)]
*  So we're giving you the vid. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2215.42s)]
*  Well, have you heard the theory that he's done? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2216.34s)]
*  Yeah. There's like a whole like this is a thing. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2217.74s)]
*  I haven't seen a video of him. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2220.1s)]
*  I haven't seen a picture of him. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2221.14s)]
*  He literally conspiracy Twitter is crazy. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2222.38s)]
*  It's crazy. I haven't heard this one. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2225.22s)]
*  No, no, we were talking about this. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2226.74s)]
*  Like he resigned like a fuckboy. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2227.9s)]
*  Like you've been with us for decades and you just send a text to Twitter like, yo, I'm [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2229.82s)]
*  out. Yeah. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2235.22s)]
*  Like usually you would have some sort of video. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2236.34s)]
*  And I understand he has covid. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2238.34s)]
*  So it might be bad to have people in the video. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2239.42s)]
*  He's upset. They bullied him. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2241.86s)]
*  They forced him to do this. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2243.82s)]
*  He also can't talk. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  He's fucking gone mentally. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2246.1800000000003s)]
*  Like all the jokes that he's dead. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2247.98s)]
*  Fine. Whatever. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2249.34s)]
*  He can't talk. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2250.58s)]
*  I don't want to see you make another fucking statement where you fumble through every [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2251.54s)]
*  word off the teleprompter. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2255.58s)]
*  He's pretty good. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2256.9s)]
*  He's pretty good off the teleprompter. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2257.94s)]
*  I think the point we all agree on is that when a president says they're not going to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2259.42s)]
*  go up for reelection, it's usually done in a more public, forward facing way than like a [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2263.74s)]
*  post on Twitter, you know, with a digital signature. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2268.8599999999997s)]
*  He didn't even sign the shit. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2273.3799999999997s)]
*  He's tight. So that's that is the theory that they bullied him out, essentially. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2275.4199999999996s)]
*  Definitely. And the same people that were like, nah, Joe got this all of a sudden flip on [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2280.62s)]
*  him. My question to you guys is, was that the plan all along? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2286.18s)]
*  Were they waiting for the...because they did it at the perfect time. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2290.14s)]
*  They didn't do it right before the Republican National Convention. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2293.02s)]
*  If they do it right before, then the whole RNC is addressing Kamala. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2296.1s)]
*  They do it right after. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2300.5s)]
*  So now all the addressing of Joe and everything that they did at the convention is useless [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2302.58s)]
*  because Joe's out here anyway. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2307.82s)]
*  I think we're giving Democrats way too much credit. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2309.66s)]
*  They don't ever do anything correctly and they're all fucking...it was...I'm not here to do [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2312.34s)]
*  this. We salute you, Joe. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2316.66s)]
*  Shit. That motherfucker should have been dropped out. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2317.94s)]
*  That was selfish to you to stay in. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2320.54s)]
*  In the same way we put our Ruth Bader Ginsburg on all these fucking T-shirts. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2322.22s)]
*  If she just decided I'm in my mid 70s with cancer, I should drop out of being a Supreme [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2325.9s)]
*  Court justice while Obama's in office. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2331.22s)]
*  Roe vs. Wade might not get overturned. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2333.86s)]
*  These motherfuckers are selfish at every turn. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2335.98s)]
*  I don't think there's some grand conspiracy. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2338.02s)]
*  I think that motherfucker wanted power and he stayed in. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2339.94s)]
*  And I honestly think the visual of Trump getting shot and then standing up and raising a fist [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2342.42s)]
*  in the air. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2349.02s)]
*  Think how he looks versus Joe Biden walking up a flight of steps. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2349.94s)]
*  There's no fucking way you vote for that man. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2354.42s)]
*  And the Democrats are inept and they're gonna...when Trump wins, I think it's a shoo-in and [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2356.82s)]
*  maybe Como is better than I think. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2361.7400000000002s)]
*  When Trump...I don't want to hear nothing about white supremacy or racism or they didn't [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2363.06s)]
*  want a black woman to be...y'all fucked it up at every fucking turn because you're selfish. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2367.26s)]
*  You don't give a fuck about nobody. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2371.62s)]
*  Don't blame us when Trump wins. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2372.62s)]
*  Now, first of all, I agree. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2373.98s)]
*  Beautifully said. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2376.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2376.94s)]
*  Cold world. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2377.3799999999997s)]
*  Very cold world that they would do that to him. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2378.62s)]
*  Now, is there any truth that the longer they waited, the easier it would be to just make [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2381.74s)]
*  Kamala the nominee? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2389.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2391.18s)]
*  That's what I suspect because I had so many different people pull me aside over the last [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2391.58s)]
*  three months, maybe even longer, that said Joe will not make it to the election. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2397.66s)]
*  They're going to pull him out and they're probably going to put in...and some would say [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2402.4599999999996s)]
*  Michelle, some would say Kamala, some would say Gavin Newsom, even Hillary. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2406.18s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2410.3799999999997s)]
*  Michael Malthus at Hillary here. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2410.58s)]
*  Michael Malthus at Hillary. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2411.7799999999997s)]
*  So if every one of our people that seems pretty invested politically said they're pulling [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2413.06s)]
*  him, they're waiting for the right time, and then it happens, it's hard for me to not believe [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2419.74s)]
*  that there is some potential design to this. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2424.8599999999997s)]
*  But here's where I would argue with the he's dead thing. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2426.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2428.8199999999997s)]
*  Because him being...if he's actually dead, that's perfect. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2429.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2431.58s)]
*  I don't think he's dead. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2431.9s)]
*  I don't think he's dead. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2432.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2432.8199999999997s)]
*  But that theory that if he was actually dead, that'd be perfect. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2432.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2435.06s)]
*  Yeah, no, that theory. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2436.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2437.0600000000004s)]
*  I was just addressing the previous like is he dead thing? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2437.5400000000004s)]
*  But then in terms of waiting, it would be a brilliant time to wait. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2439.5400000000004s)]
*  I don't... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2443.6200000000003s)]
*  Because you subvert your constituents, right? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2443.82s)]
*  You basically remove their ability to nominate the person, and then you get to put up the [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2445.78s)]
*  person that you think will hold down the party. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2451.1000000000004s)]
*  And by hold down the party, I really mean do what you tell them. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2454.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2457.5400000000004s)]
*  Because I think we can all agree that Biden is just doing what people tell him. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2457.9s)]
*  There's a few people out there. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2462.42s)]
*  We imagine...I don't even know what the system is. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2463.86s)]
*  The managerial class. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2465.1800000000003s)]
*  The managerial class. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2466.1800000000003s)]
*  But the crazy thing is we don't even know what this is. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2466.98s)]
*  The balls, the chutzpah to call Trump the end of democracy when right now the elected [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2469.46s)]
*  official isn't even the person making the decisions. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2475.82s)]
*  And there are people that are kind of OK with this. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2478.5800000000004s)]
*  They're like, yeah, but they're doing a good job. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2480.7400000000002s)]
*  Because whether they're doing a good job or not doesn't matter. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2482.34s)]
*  Like if there's a tyrant in some country that's doing a good job, it doesn't mean that he's [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2484.9s)]
*  not a tyrant, he's not a dictator. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2489.5s)]
*  This is in a lot of ways, this is like fundamentally against the core values of the American [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2491.7s)]
*  political system. You have to have representation. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2497.82s)]
*  If we vote for Biden, I want to know what Biden wants to do. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2500.46s)]
*  If we vote for Trump, I want to know what Trump wants to do. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2502.9s)]
*  Now, if his cabinet is... [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2505.42s)]
*  Wait, what are you saying? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2507.06s)]
*  I think that all presidents have a bunch of people around them making the decisions and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2508.06s)]
*  then they give the cosign if they agree with it or not. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2513.1s)]
*  I think he's still capable mentally to give the cosign on other people making decisions. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2516.4599999999996s)]
*  Now, he's that far gone. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2521.5s)]
*  Now, I will say this. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2523.22s)]
*  I agree with you and I do want that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2524.18s)]
*  I want like my president to be like the best HR director ever. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2525.62s)]
*  He doesn't have to be the expert in everything, but I want him to have like experts around. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2528.8599999999997s)]
*  But I also want to know who the experts are. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2532.3399999999997s)]
*  So if Biden was like, hey, here's my cabinet and these are the people that help me make [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2534.54s)]
*  all these decisions, then I would also know who I'm kind of voting for. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2538.06s)]
*  And I'd know... [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2541.66s)]
*  I really know. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2542.22s)]
*  No, but actually, maybe, I don't know. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2543.02s)]
*  My understanding and I think with Trump, the idea with Trump is... [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2545.7s)]
*  I'm not trying to make it a comparative thing, is the reason why he's so volatile and scary [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2549.74s)]
*  is he won't necessarily listen to those experts. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2553.58s)]
*  He's going to do what he wants to do. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2556.1s)]
*  And I think with Biden, it was like, he's going to do what the party wants him to do. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2557.62s)]
*  He hasn't done anything to like move the party line in any direction. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2561.06s)]
*  No. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2565.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2565.86s)]
*  It's been the exact typical thing that the party wants. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2566.1s)]
*  And it's just funny to call Trump the end of democracy when we're kind of seeing democracy [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2569.2599999999998s)]
*  be subverted by the Democrats as well. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2574.5s)]
*  I'm not saying that Trump wouldn't end it, but stop acting like you're holier than now. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2576.34s)]
*  I think that's why people get annoyed by Democrats. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2580.34s)]
*  They're like, there's this arrogance and condescension with the way that they describe [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2582.34s)]
*  Republicans as if they don't do the same thing. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2587.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2589.38s)]
*  And if you vote Republican, there's something wrong with you. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2589.7000000000003s)]
*  That is infuriating. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2593.3s)]
*  Again, you're just as corrupt as them. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2595.3s)]
*  They just don't lie to us. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2596.66s)]
*  I was saying... [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2597.7000000000003s)]
*  I was... [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2598.26s)]
*  What was I fucking talking to? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2598.82s)]
*  But it was just about like democratic identity right now. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2600.7400000000002s)]
*  Like I don't know a straight dude under 60 that identifies as a Democrat. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2604.02s)]
*  I know straight dudes that vote democratically. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2609.78s)]
*  I've voted democratically my whole life. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2612.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2614.34s)]
*  But I don't know one that identifies as... [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2614.58s)]
*  Like someone was like, I'm a Democrat. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2618.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2620.34s)]
*  Republicans be leaning in on that shit. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2620.7400000000002s)]
*  They are. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2622.66s)]
*  I'm conservative. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2623.06s)]
*  I'm a Republican. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2623.78s)]
*  Republicans, to the day I die. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2624.42s)]
*  I don't know a straight male under 60 years old that identifies as a Democrat. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2626.18s)]
*  Do you know one? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2634.42s)]
*  I think it's... [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2636.34s)]
*  The fact that you got to look up. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2638.18s)]
*  No, because I just... [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2639.7000000000003s)]
*  You got to look up and calculate because you don't know one because they're gay. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2640.5s)]
*  They're the party of gay. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2645.14s)]
*  That's why he identifies as a Democrat, but he doesn't know if he's straight or gay. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2646.5s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2650.18s)]
*  No, but I was just going to say that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2651.62s)]
*  I was like, it's like being straight. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2652.66s)]
*  Nobody needs to be like, yo, I'm straight. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2654.18s)]
*  It's just like, okay, if you're not yelling that you're a Republican, most likely you're a Democrat. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2656.58s)]
*  But Republicans feel the need to have to yell and tell everybody. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2662.42s)]
*  You could make that argument because they feel like they're victimized by the fact that the media [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2665.7000000000003s)]
*  is controlled, et cetera. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2669.78s)]
*  And that's a good argument. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2670.66s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2671.38s)]
*  But I also think that there's a branding issue with Democrats that they lean too far into the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2672.02s)]
*  rainbows and straight dudes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2677.2200000000003s)]
*  When I grew up as a Democrat, this is how I saw Democrats. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2680.1s)]
*  I was like, again, this is the perception of what happened as a kid. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2684.58s)]
*  Yo, the Democrats seem to like black people. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2689.7s)]
*  And I like black people. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2693.22s)]
*  So I want to be with the side that likes the black people. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2695.2999999999997s)]
*  Black people make cool shit. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2697.9399999999996s)]
*  And Republicans seem to hate gay people. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2699.06s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2701.3799999999997s)]
*  Fuck gay. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2702.2599999999998s)]
*  We're not even talking about gays yet. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2702.58s)]
*  Republicans were seen as racist. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2704.1s)]
*  The branding of it. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2707.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if that was true, but in New York, it was like, yo, if you're a Republican, are you [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2708.74s)]
*  kind of racist? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2712.18s)]
*  I'm even looking at my family who's all Republicans outside of my dad. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2713.4599999999996s)]
*  And even the way that my dad described it to me is like, yeah, I grew up in a Republican [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2717.38s)]
*  household. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2720.5s)]
*  But when it came to the civil rights, it seemed like they didn't really step up and they [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2721.06s)]
*  didn't really care. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2724.6600000000003s)]
*  My dad was like, I saw all my brothers and shit dodge the draft. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2727.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm the only one that entered the draft. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2731.54s)]
*  So you're talking all this warship, but you're dodging a draft. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2733.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm the only one that actually was in the army here. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2735.7000000000003s)]
*  And you're just ignoring the civil rights thing. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2739.62s)]
*  Nah, I'm a Democrat. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2742.26s)]
*  So it was this feeling of, to me, acceptance and looking out for this group of people that [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2743.54s)]
*  were very important culturally to America. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2752.82s)]
*  So black people, cool. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2756.2599999999998s)]
*  Democrats, you don't like black people. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2758.34s)]
*  Republican. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2760.58s)]
*  Now, Democrat got nothing to do with black people. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2762.58s)]
*  Now, Democrat is gay. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2764.66s)]
*  It's just like, how do we protect the gays? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2766.42s)]
*  How do we make everything trans? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2768.5s)]
*  How do we make everything DI? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2770.18s)]
*  And DI is just gay. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2771.7s)]
*  Everything, right? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2773.06s)]
*  Just gay women. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2774.82s)]
*  It's like women, gay, trans. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2776.1s)]
*  That's the only branding. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2777.86s)]
*  I feel like they don't give a fuck about black people no more. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2779.14s)]
*  They front like they do. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2782.34s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2784.02s)]
*  Oh, they front like they do. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2784.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2785.62s)]
*  And maybe all parts front like they do. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2786.98s)]
*  But you've got to ask yourself this question. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2788.5s)]
*  And this is why I think that straight dudes just don't identify with it. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2790.82s)]
*  Let's say that Republicans are thought of as racists. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2793.86s)]
*  I think that's going away a little bit. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2796.2599999999998s)]
*  But let's just say Republicans are thought of as racists still. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2797.54s)]
*  But Democrats are thought of as gay. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2800.5s)]
*  Would you rather people think you're racist or gay? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2803.38s)]
*  Gay. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2806.34s)]
*  Do you rather think people think you're gay? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2807.54s)]
*  Gay. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2808.98s)]
*  Because you're black, you can't be racist. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2810.58s)]
*  Damn. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2812.42s)]
*  He got out. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2813.54s)]
*  That's clever. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2814.34s)]
*  I think for the average dude, right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2817.86s)]
*  You're cool with the gay shit, obviously. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2819.86s)]
*  You ain't in it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2821.46s)]
*  Fucking nails and stuff. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2822.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think for the average dude, they would rather [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2823.62s)]
*  people think that they're a little racist than a little gay. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2826.18s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2829.46s)]
*  They already tell you that you're kind of racist. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2830.1s)]
*  They'll be like, oh, yeah, you got implicit racism. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2832.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're implicitly racist living in America. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2834.7400000000002s)]
*  So you're already racist. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2836.5s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2837.54s)]
*  Well, if I'm already racist, I'm with them. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2838.02s)]
*  Not the nip tucks. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2841.14s)]
*  I don't want to fuck with the nip tucks. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2842.42s)]
*  So the branding, I think that they really thought that they were doing [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2844.18s)]
*  the right thing being progressive and protecting these oppressed people. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2847.06s)]
*  It could come from a good place. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2850.18s)]
*  But they lean so far into that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2852.58s)]
*  Yeah, and they need some protections. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2854.34s)]
*  But they lean so far into, to your point. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2855.46s)]
*  You alienated all the straight dudes. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2857.3s)]
*  And now you just got a bunch of women, gays and trans that are like, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2859.7s)]
*  rah, rah, rah, Democrats. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2862.58s)]
*  And everybody else is like, all right, bro. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2863.8599999999997s)]
*  How many Disney movies we got to make? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2867.62s)]
*  To your point. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2869.06s)]
*  Why was Grindr going crazy at the RNC? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=2869.7799999999997s)]

*  I know you got yours. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3578.28s)]
*  I'm very excited to get mine because I legitimately love my mattress, but it gets so fucking hot. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3579.88s)]
*  And sleep is treating for you. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3584.52s)]

*  I'm actually legitimately so excited for this. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3587.32s)]
*  And I thought you had to get a whole new bed, which they do sell, but just having a cover? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3590.1200000000003s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3593.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm so hyped. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3594.0400000000004s)]
*  I think it's absolutely fantastic. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3594.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3595.7200000000003s)]
*  And you like yours? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3596.28s)]
*  Yes, because when you have a newborn, you need to maximize any hours you have. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3598.04s)]

*  Yo, I learned some fire shit about cricket, man. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3643.7999999999997s)]
*  What's up? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3646.2s)]
*  Cricket's kind of fire. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3648.2799999999997s)]
*  I ain't gonna lie. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3649.16s)]
*  It's so fun. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3649.8799999999997s)]
*  Dude, I wish you could have gone. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3650.4399999999996s)]
*  Cricket's kind of fire. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3651.64s)]
*  Cricket's kind of fire. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3652.52s)]
*  But that, I know this is going to sound like I'm making a loyal to the soil joke. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3653.72s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3658.6s)]
*  But the longer the game goes, the more bowling, the more pitching, it affects the grounds. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3659.3999999999996s)]
*  So you could fuck it better. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3668.2799999999997s)]
*  So it affects the ground and the ball starts, the ball, I guess you would call it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3678.6s)]
*  The ball starts bouncing in unpredictable ways later on in the game. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3681.8s)]
*  So if you have, I don't know if it's better if you have an advantage or disadvantage bowling, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3686.2000000000003s)]
*  but that's something that you got to calculate with it. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3689.5600000000004s)]
*  I think that's like a thing you never even consider. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3692.6000000000004s)]
*  Imagine like the wood started changing during a basketball game. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3695.0800000000004s)]
*  And right when you start to figure out the spin of the bowler, the ground starts changing. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3697.96s)]
*  So now you got to calculate everything. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3701.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3703.6400000000003s)]
*  That's tennis, same thing, like Wimbledon, they play on grass. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3704.6800000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3707.0s)]
*  And the later the tournament goes, the harder it is. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3707.5s)]
*  I mean, this is even like you want to get to the minutiae. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3710.2799999999997s)]
*  The later the game, the higher the grass grows. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3712.36s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3716.2s)]
*  So they have to keep the grass at a certain level. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3717.56s)]
*  But it's like in hockey where you need the Zamboni to come and fix this shit. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3719.56s)]
*  Anyway, I thought that it was an interesting component with the coaching of... [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3724.12s)]
*  I'm very like, what's the word, noob or whatever with cricket, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3729.24s)]
*  but yeah, there's so much detail that they think about everything. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3732.36s)]
*  Also, you could send a guy into bowl and then take him out, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3735.08s)]
*  and he could still go back in. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3738.6s)]
*  Yeah, but they can only bowl a certain number of bowls. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3739.96s)]
*  Yeah, but you can mix and match throughout. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3742.12s)]
*  Yeah, thousand percent. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3744.52s)]
*  So there's constant strategy. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3745.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3746.7599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, I'm... [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3747.2599999999998s)]
*  How far? We got quite a... [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3748.2s)]
*  I don't know who posted. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3749.16s)]
*  If two billion people like something, I feel like we're treating cricket the same way that [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3749.88s)]
*  Americans treated soccer, where first we reject it and eventually like... [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3753.56s)]
*  What you need is like the video game. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3758.52s)]
*  Yeah, and also you need America to get... [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3760.8399999999997s)]
*  Once America's good, if anybody... [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3762.2s)]
*  We're invested in it. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3764.12s)]
*  Yeah, then we do a fuck. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3765.08s)]
*  I don't know who posted in the group chat. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3766.92s)]
*  They were playing... [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3769.32s)]
*  Paddle with cricket? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3770.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3771.48s)]
*  That's true. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3771.98s)]
*  Yo, this is fire. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3773.48s)]
*  And I'm like, this is just pickleball with the long stick. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3774.44s)]
*  Nah, but that shit is heavy. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3778.04s)]
*  But it's just pickleball. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3779.8s)]
*  You thought it was fire. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3781.6400000000003s)]
*  It was a hand-eye coordination with the dexterity. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3782.92s)]
*  Really are two athletes. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3787.0s)]
*  Did you see how focused they were when there's no mud on the ground? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3788.1200000000003s)]
*  I think they didn't miss one single ball. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3791.08s)]
*  We're either gonna have an Indian president or an Indian vice president. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3793.32s)]
*  We're gonna have an Indian in the White House. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3796.92s)]
*  Yo, can y'all explain this JD Vance thing? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3798.12s)]
*  So Trump picks JD Vance. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3800.52s)]
*  So I've been trying to research... [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3801.88s)]
*  Who the fuck is JD Vance? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3803.3199999999997s)]
*  I've been trying to research this guy all day. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3803.96s)]
*  So, grows up, born in Middletown, Ohio, big Rust Belt town, like blue collar, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3805.48s)]
*  grandfather is a steel miner. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3811.56s)]
*  Goes to Yale. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3813.08s)]
*  So, mom didn't, it's strange from his father, mom was a drug addict. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3814.44s)]
*  Who? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3819.4s)]
*  Like, a man in and out of her life, whatever. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3820.3599999999997s)]
*  He gets, he has to move to Kentucky, gets raised by his grandparents, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3822.3599999999997s)]
*  goes to OSU, like really pulls himself out of whatever, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3825.08s)]
*  out of the tough situation, goes to OSU, then goes to Yale Law School. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3828.6s)]
*  Weird story or cool story. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3832.36s)]
*  Vivek. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3833.88s)]
*  Him and Vivek are homies. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3834.68s)]
*  He has three kids with, he has an Indian wife, three kids, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3835.64s)]
*  only one of them has an Indian name, the name is Vivek. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3838.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3841.8s)]
*  It's quite possible the guy's named after Vivek or Amaswamy. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3842.2s)]
*  I don't know, they're like homies. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3844.68s)]
*  There's a thing where Vivek is being asked that and he's kind of denying it, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3845.96s)]
*  but he's like, we're close friends, we're close friends. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3849.64s)]
*  You have to ask him about that. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3851.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3852.2s)]
*  The other kids are like Noah and some other Christian name. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3853.56s)]
*  So gets married, 2015 starts a venture capital fund, I think, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3856.92s)]
*  and 2016 rolls around, election rolls around, very anti-Trump, fucking hates Trump. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3862.2s)]
*  Doesn't just hate Trump, the person says something about his policies. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3867.16s)]
*  I have the quote written down, but something like, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3870.68s)]
*  they range from absurd to immoral or something like that. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3872.68s)]
*  So he goes at Trump as a person and he compares him to Hitler as a person, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3877.3199999999997s)]
*  goes at his policies, shitting on him all the time, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3881.08s)]
*  starts a charity in Ohio, doing all these things. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3884.6s)]
*  I think the charity eventually folds, 2021 he enters the Senate race, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3887.24s)]
*  all of a sudden, loves Trump, pro-Trump. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3891.0s)]
*  Hey, this guy's great. January 6th wasn't that bad. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3893.7999999999997s)]
*  What y'all did to him didn't make any sense. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3896.6s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats are like, what the fuck, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3898.12s)]
*  we loved this guy a few years ago because he wrote this book in 2016 called [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3899.96s)]
*  Hibli Elegy. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3903.24s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3904.52s)]
*  It's, you know, I had to look it up. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3905.88s)]
*  It's the same thing as a eulogy, but a eulogy is typically written, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3908.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, spoken and typically more like praising, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3911.08s)]
*  and elegy is more like sad in tone and is written only. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3915.16s)]
*  So it's the same thing. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3918.12s)]
*  But it's a eulogy for Hillbillies? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3919.0s)]
*  For like, yeah, this part of America that's just dying. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3921.3199999999997s)]
*  Ah, God, it's not a movie. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3924.52s)]
*  It made into a movie. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3926.36s)]
*  Ron Howard did. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3927.56s)]
*  Ron Howard directed it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3928.2799999999997s)]
*  The book liberals love, they think this is like our kind of Republican, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3929.4s)]
*  like this, he's not in office yet, but we love this guy. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3933.24s)]
*  And he's, this is what's also funny. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3935.72s)]
*  A lot of the book is like blaming hillbilly culture for what happened. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3937.3199999999997s)]
*  Not like, he's like, you can still pull yourself out. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3941.48s)]
*  This is America. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3943.64s)]
*  Hillbillies feel like if you work hard, then there's no point. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3944.6s)]
*  There's some like self-reflection. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3947.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's some pull yourself up. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3949.16s)]
*  But it's funny because liberals are like, that guy's great. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3950.6s)]
*  If he was black writing that book about black people, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3953.24s)]
*  Republicans would be like, this guy's awesome. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3956.12s)]
*  And then left would have been like, what an Uncle Tom, fuck you. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3958.12s)]
*  Right point. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3960.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so they love him. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3961.08s)]
*  But all of a sudden, anti-Biden in 2020 voting for Trump, this is weird. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3962.68s)]
*  He says, oh, I got to know Trump. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3967.16s)]
*  I like his policies, but it is a really fucking strong 180. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3969.16s)]
*  When you call this policies idiotic, when you knew them in 2016, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3972.2799999999997s)]
*  what changed in those four years? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3976.12s)]
*  It seemed kind of like that's just what gets you elected. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3978.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you got asked to be the second most powerful person in the world. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3980.6s)]
*  Yeah, but this 2021 before, so he started angling for it probably. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3984.3599999999997s)]
*  He needed to win the election. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3987.64s)]
*  You want to win as a Republican. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3988.6s)]
*  I need Trump on my side. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3989.8799999999997s)]
*  Let me just say I was wrong. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3991.16s)]
*  That's kind of what it seems like. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3992.36s)]
*  So how does he pivot? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3994.76s)]
*  What does he say? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3996.28s)]
*  So he's just like, I didn't know the guy. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3997.0s)]
*  I actually agree with a lot of his policies. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=3998.76s)]
*  And this is where it's like, I don't hate the guy, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4000.6800000000003s)]
*  but it's just a politician fucking thing. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4003.0s)]
*  If it was genuine, I'm cool with that. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4005.0s)]
*  I like the fact that people flip-flop. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4007.08s)]
*  I think flip-flopping is important in life. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4008.6s)]
*  When you get new information, you should change your mind. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4010.44s)]
*  That's too big of a flip-flop. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4013.32s)]
*  If you're doing it, it's impossible for you to be a person in politics [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4015.2400000000002s)]
*  and not know somebody's policies. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4020.52s)]
*  So you were either ignorant to your field, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4022.36s)]
*  if he was in politics when he was saying this about Trump, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4025.96s)]
*  or did he switch once he entered politics? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4028.44s)]
*  I tend to believe the latter. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4030.44s)]
*  And I tried to do a lot of digging on this guy [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4031.8s)]
*  in the last couple of days. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4033.8s)]
*  And here's one thing that's like, yeah, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4034.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know how genuine you are. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4036.6s)]
*  One policy that he really agrees with Trump on [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4038.44s)]
*  is stopping illegal immigration. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4040.36s)]
*  Fine. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4042.36s)]
*  He says, my mom... [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4042.84s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4044.2000000000003s)]
*  I'll get to it. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4044.84s)]
*  Let me get there. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4045.4s)]
*  Let me get here. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4046.52s)]
*  So he says, my mom almost died, and this is true, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4047.48s)]
*  from a heroin overdose, from probably drugs [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4050.6s)]
*  that were shipped in here illegally from Mexico. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4053.4s)]
*  Here's what... [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4058.12s)]
*  Here, let me get to this. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4058.52s)]
*  So, okay. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4059.4s)]
*  Mom almost died because she doesn't drugs. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4059.88s)]
*  Your mom did drugs. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4061.16s)]
*  She probably had... [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4062.04s)]
*  We could shut down the heroin, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4063.48s)]
*  we could shut down the fentanyl, all these things. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4064.68s)]
*  She's going to have another drug. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4066.6s)]
*  She's going to have alcohol. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4067.64s)]
*  Well, here's where... [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4068.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4069.16s)]
*  Here's where, again, let me get there. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4069.72s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4071.4s)]
*  You're going to see this is like, oh, all right, I see what it is. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4072.44s)]
*  His mom started as a nurse addicted to painkillers [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4075.7999999999997s)]
*  and then OxyContin. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4078.68s)]
*  When he graduates from Yale Law School, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4080.2s)]
*  the first law firm he works for represents Purdue Pharma, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4082.12s)]
*  who makes OxyContin. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4086.3599999999997s)]
*  So you got no fucking problem with Purdue Pharma, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4088.04s)]
*  with Big Pharma. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4091.3999999999996s)]
*  I'll go hard at illegal immigration, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4093.24s)]
*  but the Pharma lobby, I'm not... [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4095.48s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4097.4s)]
*  Also, this is even fucking crazier. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4098.36s)]
*  His charity was called Our Ohio Renewal, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4100.679999999999s)]
*  and it was just, I think the initiative was like, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4103.16s)]
*  let's rebuild Ohio. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4104.76s)]
*  Let's rebuild this part of America that I grew up in, that I love. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4105.96s)]
*  One thing that he did, very nice in theory, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4109.0s)]
*  he sent a psychiatrist to middle America [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4112.759999999999s)]
*  to help people with OxyContin addictions. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4115.24s)]
*  The psychiatrist he sent was essentially on Purdue Pharma's payroll, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4117.0s)]
*  literally did studies being like, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4121.4s)]
*  OxyContin is not addictive, it's not that bad. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4123.48s)]
*  And now you're sending this lady to get these people clean? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4126.04s)]
*  So to me, it's just like, oh, you're kind of a fraud. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4128.679999999999s)]
*  You're kind of... [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4131.4s)]
*  Also, it doesn't feel like a drain the swamp guy, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4132.2s)]
*  kind of feels like a swamp creature. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4134.44s)]
*  And I think this is where... [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4135.879999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything about him. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4137.8s)]
*  I got to do my research. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4139.0s)]
*  But from what you're telling me, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4139.96s)]
*  this does not feel like this political outsider [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4141.48s)]
*  that would galvanize the Trump base. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4143.8s)]
*  Other dots to connect that tie back into the Elon thing [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4145.48s)]
*  that you brought up earlier. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4147.88s)]
*  I didn't even know that he was donating $40 million a month or whatever. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4148.76s)]
*  He said that before Vance got elected, or chosen as VP, right? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4151.5599999999995s)]
*  So when he starts his startup in 2015, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4155.48s)]
*  his venture capital fund, Peter Thiel backs it. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4159.08s)]
*  In 2021, when he decides to run for Senate, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4162.599999999999s)]
*  Peter Thiel donates $15 million, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4164.68s)]
*  which is a massive amount of money [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4167.320000000001s)]
*  to a guy just running for Senate. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4168.84s)]
*  So he seems to be in the pocket of these Silicon Valley guys, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4170.4400000000005s)]
*  it would seem. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4174.280000000001s)]
*  Apparently, Biden has done... [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4176.84s)]
*  Or the people behind Biden have done some things [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4179.08s)]
*  that you should praise. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4181.16s)]
*  They broke non-compete agreements. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4182.12s)]
*  They are cracking down a little bit on techno-fascism, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4183.88s)]
*  which is like Silicon Valley. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4186.360000000001s)]
*  This is an interesting part of it. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4187.96s)]
*  I've looked up techno-fascism. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4189.16s)]
*  I asked Robbie. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4190.360000000001s)]
*  Robbie's on vacation. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4191.08s)]
*  I was like, tell me about this guy. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4191.96s)]
*  And he's like, just look up techno-fascism and whatever. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4193.72s)]
*  Basically, one important part of this idea of techno-fascism is [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4196.84s)]
*  Silicon Valley doesn't have to play politics anymore. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4201.240000000001s)]
*  They can kind of set the agenda. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4204.280000000001s)]
*  If Elon Musk wants a policy out there, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4205.88s)]
*  instead of going to the government, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4208.68s)]
*  he can just start tweeting about it. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4210.04s)]
*  Maybe even theoretically, not that he's doing this, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4211.88s)]
*  pumping tweets that push the agendas he wants, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4214.4400000000005s)]
*  then that becomes what the voter base wants. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4217.400000000001s)]
*  And then the policy changes that way. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4219.96s)]
*  Biden is kind of cracking down on Silicon Valley. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4221.64s)]
*  Y'all shouldn't be able to just run amok like this. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4223.64s)]
*  I don't know how much he's actually accomplishing, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4226.200000000001s)]
*  but that's his idea. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4227.72s)]
*  You look at this guy, JD Vance. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4229.320000000001s)]
*  He's already in Peter Thiel's pocket. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4231.8s)]
*  Shout out to Peter Thiel, though. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4234.68s)]
*  That motherfucker's badass. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4235.72s)]
*  He's a badass. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4237.0s)]
*  All these guys are bad. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4237.64s)]
*  Elon Musk is a badass. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4238.280000000001s)]
*  But now... [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4239.240000000001s)]
*  He's the best gay. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4239.64s)]
*  And he's not even a Democrat. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4241.8s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4243.160000000001s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4244.360000000001s)]
*  Even the Democrats are too gay for Peter Thiel. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4245.72s)]
*  He's more racist than gay. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4247.8s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4249.0s)]
*  This guy fucking gets it. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4250.4400000000005s)]
*  He's not going to let himself be defined by smoking cocks. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4251.88s)]
*  He's a billionaire that developed all these incredible businesses. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4254.6s)]
*  He's an early investor in all these different startups [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4257.64s)]
*  that now become these billion-dollar companies. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4260.360000000001s)]
*  Do you think the only thing people want to think about him is he's gay? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4262.68s)]
*  Matter of fact, I think he took down Gawker for Hogan [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4265.64s)]
*  simply because Gawker outed him for being gay back in the day. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4270.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4273.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4273.56s)]
*  And they took his name. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4274.360000000001s)]
*  Which is low-key a gross thing. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4275.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's gross. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4277.56s)]
*  Gawker's fucking gross. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4278.360000000001s)]
*  That's disgusting, bro. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4279.96s)]
*  I think you're talking about the gay. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4280.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4281.96s)]
*  No, yeah, to be gay back then, that's not what you were... [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4283.799999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4286.28s)]
*  That's what I was saying. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4286.759999999999s)]
*  No, come on. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4287.4s)]
*  It's fucking AIDS everywhere. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4288.12s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4289.4s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4290.04s)]
*  No, no, it is gross to just out somebody like that. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4290.5199999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4294.04s)]
*  But that makes this guy seem like he's kind of in the pocket of tech. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4294.599999999999s)]
*  How is he going to be able to manipulate people [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4298.12s)]
*  that want to get their start in tech if they already know he's gay? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4299.879999999999s)]
*  Peter Thiel? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4303.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4304.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4304.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey, millions of dollars, honestly. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4306.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4308.12s)]
*  That's what he'll do. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4308.36s)]
*  Shout out Peter Thiel. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4309.48s)]
*  I like that guy. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4310.28s)]
*  No, I got no problem with it, but it does seem like [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4311.0s)]
*  this JD Vance pick happened because a lot of money got thrown behind him. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4313.8s)]
*  Trumpy, Trumpy, Trumpy. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4319.5599999999995s)]
*  So what is Trump seeing him? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4320.76s)]
*  I think he sees someone who can't overshadow him. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4323.4s)]
*  That's probably part of it. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4327.0s)]
*  Talk that shit. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4327.8s)]
*  So it's like, think about it. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4328.599999999999s)]
*  I think... [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4330.36s)]
*  Fucking cream puff. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4331.0s)]
*  A little cream puff over there. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4335.5599999999995s)]
*  Take that cream puff. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4336.84s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4337.48s)]
*  Take that cream puff. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4338.28s)]
*  I won't shoot you now. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4339.96s)]
*  You just sick of me. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4340.84s)]
*  All right, go, go, go. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4341.8s)]
*  No, so let's start with Kamala. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4342.759999999999s)]
*  I do feel like four years of Biden, Kamala was silenced a little bit. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4344.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, hey, don't make Biden look bad. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4349.08s)]
*  Don't overshadow him. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4351.48s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4353.32s)]
*  And that worked for Biden because people are like, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4355.719999999999s)]
*  I'd rather keep Biden here than have Kamala. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4359.48s)]
*  I think Trump saw that and he's like, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4362.84s)]
*  I don't want anyone who is like, people would even want to replace me. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4364.76s)]
*  Like Pence. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4369.08s)]
*  Pence, yeah, we need that with Pence. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4369.72s)]
*  Yeah, but Pence was kind of like, he had the evangelicals on his side and like, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4371.8s)]
*  they backed him a lot. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4376.52s)]
*  This guy, nobody gives a fuck about him. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4378.4400000000005s)]
*  I think he helps you seal Ohio, which you probably would get anyway, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4379.96s)]
*  but you need that Rust Belt, you need Ohio, Michigan, all that. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4383.08s)]
*  I think he saw the debate and I think after the gunship, he's so far ahead, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4385.56s)]
*  he's like, I don't even need anybody right now. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4390.6s)]
*  He's actually distancing himself from the abortion ship. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4393.16s)]
*  He's smart to. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4396.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4397.24s)]
*  Distance himself in Project 2025. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4397.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4399.24s)]
*  This is what I hope he'll do in 2016. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4399.5599999999995s)]
*  He doesn't need the extremist anymore because he's like, oh, I got this shit in the bag. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4401.4s)]
*  Now I don't got to be extreme anymore. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4405.24s)]
*  So it's like, let me pick somebody that nobody gives a fuck about, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4406.84s)]
*  that nobody wants to replace me because I got it. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4409.4s)]
*  He has straight Democrats. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4411.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4412.76s)]
*  He does. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4414.04s)]
*  I genuinely believe he has straight male Democrats. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4414.599999999999s)]
*  No, I just think people are going to stay home. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4417.16s)]
*  Which is almost a vote for Trump. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4419.639999999999s)]
*  Almost a vote for Trump, yeah. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4421.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4421.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4422.52s)]
*  They will abstain. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4423.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4424.280000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4425.080000000001s)]
*  I don't know if people will go as far. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4425.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, the shooting thing, the day after the shooting of the election was there, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4426.84s)]
*  I'm voting for Trump. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4430.360000000001s)]
*  But you got four months till then. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4431.080000000001s)]
*  So he could fuck it up in four months. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4432.76s)]
*  Like, it's so tricky because- [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4434.76s)]
*  When they announced Kamala, well, when Biden said like, I'm supporting Kamala, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4437.96s)]
*  and then immediately Trump was like, nah, we got to change the- [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4442.6s)]
*  Debates. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4446.040000000001s)]
*  Debate. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4446.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, you don't want to give her a shine. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4446.92s)]
*  Nah, come on. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4449.240000000001s)]
*  It's a half black, half Indian. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4450.120000000001s)]
*  You know me, you ain't going to argue with this girl and say nothing. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4451.16s)]
*  She's going to kick the fuck out of him in the debates. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4453.32s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4455.0s)]
*  The fact that he wanted to change the debates, he's like, oh, I think he's a little scared. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4455.8s)]
*  That's because she tried to be white. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4459.24s)]
*  She's going to be black as fuck in these debates. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4460.44s)]
*  This is the only time you're ever going to look Indian. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4462.92s)]
*  Throw a sandal or something. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4464.12s)]
*  So now, former prosecutor against a convicted convict. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4465.24s)]
*  I mean, it's a great matchup. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4469.96s)]
*  It's a pay-per-view matchup. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4471.639999999999s)]
*  But I wonder if he's looking at it like a prize fighter. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4472.599999999999s)]
*  Conor McGregor can't listen to every single person that calls him out [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4476.76s)]
*  because you're just going to give that person shine. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4480.52s)]
*  But if you notice, after Jake Paul's win against Mike Perry, shout out to both of them. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4482.68s)]
*  I hope they made all the fucking money in the world. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4487.8s)]
*  Both of them. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4489.8s)]
*  But Conor started talking shit to Jake because he knows Jake got the energy. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4491.56s)]
*  Jake is at a level where it's worth talking shit to. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4498.2s)]
*  Jake wasn't initially. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4501.08s)]
*  When Jake was fighting the YouTubers or whatever, he wasn't big enough for Conor. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4503.32s)]
*  But now Conor had to step out of that fight. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4506.68s)]
*  He feels he's coming down a little bit. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4508.68s)]
*  And this Jake guy is unstoppable. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4510.280000000001s)]
*  So now you talk some shit. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4512.6s)]
*  So I wonder if Trump's looking at it like, okay, if I go on the stage with Kamala, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4513.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to give her shine. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4517.0s)]
*  She cannot create herself. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4517.88s)]
*  I can just create shine. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4519.72s)]
*  I can create moments. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4521.16s)]
*  I dodge bullets. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4522.280000000001s)]
*  What is this chick going to do to galvanize? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4523.88s)]
*  I could give her an opportunity to galvanize. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4526.04s)]
*  I'm already on top of her. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4527.96s)]
*  High risk, no reward. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4529.0s)]
*  Now, the American people deserve a debate. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4530.04s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4531.64s)]
*  They're doing a debate. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4532.52s)]
*  He just said, let's put it on Fox, not whatever was supposed to be on CNN. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4533.08s)]
*  Because he wants the moderators to be a little bit more. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4536.679999999999s)]
*  Well, actually, the last one was on CNN. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4540.04s)]
*  You can pay for the rights to a debate. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4541.48s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4543.0s)]
*  No, we should not be exclusive. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4545.0s)]
*  And the same with the State of the Union address is for every network. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4546.36s)]
*  This should be bigger than. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4549.799999999999s)]
*  No, it should be on C-SPAN. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4552.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4553.799999999999s)]
*  Now you're right. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4554.28s)]
*  Insane. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4554.839999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, you're right. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4555.32s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4556.04s)]
*  This is like a thing that we should be objective about. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4556.5199999999995s)]
*  And I should be able to objectively vote for who I want. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4559.719999999999s)]
*  I don't want you swaying the questions in either direction. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4562.44s)]
*  I should be allowed to make an informed vote. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4565.24s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4567.16s)]
*  You can just buy the rights like it's a Super Bowl. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4568.28s)]
*  It is tricky, though, because that is like the I hate even saying this. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4569.96s)]
*  It sounds like such a fucking trope, but like the culture of consumption, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4574.28s)]
*  the fact that we only really value things that are monetizable. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4578.679999999999s)]
*  It's like I know you're laughing because it does sound gay, right? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4582.2s)]
*  The culture of consumption. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4584.76s)]
*  But like it's the same thing. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4585.8s)]
*  Like I even talked to I talked to my wife about this a little bit. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4587.96s)]
*  The reason why I think motherhood isn't valued in American culture as much as it is valued, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4591.24s)]
*  let's say, in like Indian culture is because you can't monetize it. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4597.64s)]
*  Like the things you can monetize are valued. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4603.08s)]
*  Hedge fund directors. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4605.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's valuable. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4606.6s)]
*  Why is that more valuable than teachers? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4607.64s)]
*  Not value. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4609.24s)]
*  Not monetize it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4609.8s)]
*  So when culture is dominated by money, we only value those positions that can generate revenue. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4611.32s)]
*  And then you leave to the wayside these very important positions, i.e. teacher or mother, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4618.12s)]
*  you have women out here that feel like they should work even though they don't have to [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4622.76s)]
*  just to meet up with societal expectations. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4625.88s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, they're not hanging out with their kids. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4627.96s)]
*  Or you got I don't want to sound like I'm taking shots at Elon, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4630.5199999999995s)]
*  but you got a dad that got 12 different kids and he works 20 hours a week at all these different [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4632.76s)]
*  things. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4637.4s)]
*  And you could argue that he is upholding democratic values and doing all these amazing [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4637.64s)]
*  things for society, which he is, but at the cost of what? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4642.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4645.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4646.92s)]
*  Like he might be chasing a bag, but at the cost of what? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4647.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4650.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4651.32s)]
*  Sorry to derail, but you get what I'm saying. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4651.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4654.679999999999s)]
*  There are limitations to everything. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4654.839999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4656.36s)]
*  This is why it got this way, but there's got to be a line. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4656.839999999999s)]
*  It started out as gay, but then I think it got to a good point. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4659.48s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4661.639999999999s)]
*  Straight. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4662.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4662.599999999999s)]
*  By the end, I got straight. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4662.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4663.879999999999s)]
*  But it started pretty gay. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4664.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4666.04s)]
*  Begin it straight. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4666.36s)]
*  I started with culture of consumption and we don't give moms enough credit. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4667.16s)]
*  I was like, I got to dig myself out of this. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4671.32s)]
*  But yeah, you just got to, I think elections should be spin free in those, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4673.64s)]
*  like we're all going to do afterwards, spin the fuck out of it. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4679.24s)]
*  When they're talking, let them talk. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4681.88s)]
*  So genuine question. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4683.56s)]
*  How do we decide who the moderators are then? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4684.76s)]
*  And who makes that decision? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4687.320000000001s)]
*  Is it like a jury? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4690.04s)]
*  Now the jury would be decided by the defendant's lawyer, right? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4690.92s)]
*  To a certain extent, they get to eliminate certain jurors. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4694.360000000001s)]
*  How does it work out? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4698.280000000001s)]
*  Decided by both. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4698.92s)]
*  But don't they get to omit certain? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4699.88s)]
*  Each side gets, I think, 12 people they can knock off. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4702.44s)]
*  Find someone each side is okay with. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4706.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4707.5599999999995s)]
*  So now, but now we're going to have like a super, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4708.12s)]
*  now you got the fucking Supreme Court where you got like the Republicans and the, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4710.44s)]
*  like what is the- [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4714.12s)]
*  But that's how debates used to be. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4715.08s)]
*  They used to have one debate on CNN, one on Fox, one on- [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4716.5199999999995s)]
*  A neutral platform. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4721.0s)]
*  A neutral 13 PBS or something like that. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4721.88s)]
*  That's what they used to do. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4724.36s)]
*  When? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4725.24s)]
*  As a kid, I, there wasn't even- [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4725.639999999999s)]
*  Always. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4727.0s)]
*  Most of us didn't even have cable. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4727.48s)]
*  How was it? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4728.5199999999995s)]
*  I saw debates in 1992 when I didn't have cable. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4729.08s)]
*  So it wasn't on CNN. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4732.28s)]
*  There's no way it was on CNN. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4733.48s)]
*  I remember when they used to have the, oh, the ticker at the bottom of like, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4734.44s)]
*  oh, how much people were like scoring the debate as it was going on. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4739.0s)]
*  And that was a CNN thing that they started doing. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4744.12s)]
*  Every channel would play it. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4745.96s)]
*  That's, it wasn't exclusive. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4747.16s)]
*  Exclusive rights is banned. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4748.84s)]
*  I could have swore. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4750.04s)]
*  I thought- [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4750.84s)]
*  No, it was on every channel. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4751.16s)]
*  One channel had it? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4752.5199999999995s)]
*  For a fact. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4753.08s)]
*  1992, 1996. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4753.72s)]
*  In the, not a Declaration of Defendants, but it's like, they have to do it. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4755.64s)]
*  So I think that C-SPAN, it's like a government thing. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4760.28s)]
*  So they put it on all the channels. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4762.76s)]
*  But now the tricky thing is like- [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4764.04s)]
*  I don't think a debate- [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4765.4800000000005s)]
*  They have a commission, apparently. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4766.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4767.4800000000005s)]
*  They have a commission of presidential debates that [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4767.8s)]
*  is like responsible for selecting the moderator. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4769.96s)]
*  Now, I will say this. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4771.88s)]
*  I thought CNN did a great job with the last debate. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4773.56s)]
*  Yeah, I thought the last debate was good. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4775.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4776.36s)]
*  Yeah, but I do agree with you, which is like, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4776.76s)]
*  you shouldn't be able to put up money- [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4779.24s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4782.2s)]
*  To- [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4782.92s)]
*  The exclusive rights to democracy? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4783.639999999999s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4785.32s)]
*  True. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4786.28s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4786.68s)]
*  That's the most capitalistic shit. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4787.72s)]
*  Yeah, like this is fucking insane. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4789.24s)]
*  The exclusive rights to democracy. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4790.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4792.2s)]
*  It really annoys me. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4793.08s)]
*  One thing that- [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4793.96s)]
*  You did that JD Vance shit great. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4794.76s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Doug. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4796.36s)]

*  You talking about Hillbilly Elegy and shit? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4809.96s)]

*  Oh, okay, go on, go on. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4818.28s)]
*  Apparently, one thing that Trump can do against Biden- [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4819.719999999999s)]
*  or against Kamala is be like, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4821.719999999999s)]
*  do you think Biden was senile? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4823.16s)]
*  Do you think during his presidency he was senile? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4825.32s)]
*  And then if she says no, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4827.48s)]
*  then it's like, well, why didn't he continue to run? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4828.92s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4830.839999999999s)]
*  And if she says yes, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4831.719999999999s)]
*  then it's like, well, why did you support [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4832.5199999999995s)]
*  a candidate that was senile in the White House? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4833.96s)]
*  That ain't gonna work. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4836.759999999999s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4837.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4838.12s)]
*  I read it. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4838.839999999999s)]
*  I was like, that's kind of nice. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4839.16s)]
*  It's good. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4840.12s)]
*  I don't think people will care, but it's good. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4840.76s)]
*  Yeah, but people are like, oh. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4842.360000000001s)]
*  I think what will happen is I think that [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4843.160000000001s)]
*  it's so funny how pendulums swing. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4845.64s)]
*  Didn't we always say even on this podcast, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4848.360000000001s)]
*  Republicans get in line. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4850.84s)]
*  Republicans get behind their candidate, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4852.6s)]
*  and Republicans are going to support it. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4854.52s)]
*  Now it feels like Democrats are adopting the same philosophy, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4857.240000000001s)]
*  where they're like, where's the party going? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4860.68s)]
*  Is it going with Kamala? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4862.52s)]
*  All right, give her all the money. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4863.4800000000005s)]
*  She raised some crazy amount of money. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4864.68s)]
*  I don't know if that was transferred from Biden [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4866.120000000001s)]
*  or she generally- [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4867.72s)]
*  I think she got the most donations in it. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4869.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4870.360000000001s)]
*  That's also a bit like, of course, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4871.320000000001s)]
*  you only have a fucking month to donate. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4872.68s)]
*  You're gonna donate. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4874.68s)]
*  There's only a month. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4875.96s)]
*  We're all gonna give it right now. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4876.92s)]
*  Three weeks until the DNC. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4877.64s)]
*  Yeah, so of course we're gonna donate. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4880.04s)]
*  But I thought that was a bit misleading. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4881.96s)]
*  Yeah, I heard another crazy thing. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4884.76s)]
*  Go, go, give me, give me. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4886.280000000001s)]
*  This is a fun little just like- [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4887.08s)]
*  I love, I love. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4888.360000000001s)]
*  People are talking about all the Trump shooting. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4889.400000000001s)]
*  They're saying like, oh, this is Teddy Roosevelt moment. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4891.240000000001s)]
*  Because Teddy Roosevelt had an assassination attempt. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4893.320000000001s)]
*  I think they got shot him, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4895.400000000001s)]
*  and it got stopped by his whole speech. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4896.6s)]
*  He got shot, it hit his eyeglass case, hit his speech, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4898.6s)]
*  went into his body, didn't kill him, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4901.64s)]
*  and then gave the speech. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4903.240000000001s)]
*  Where did he get shot? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4904.76s)]
*  It happened in Milwaukee. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4905.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, Teddy Roosevelt gave his speech [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4907.56s)]
*  after he got shot in Milwaukee [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4909.320000000001s)]
*  and gave like an 86-minute speech. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4910.84s)]
*  And then Trump gets shot, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4913.88s)]
*  goes to Milwaukee for the RNC, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4916.120000000001s)]
*  and then gives a 90-minute speech. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4917.96s)]
*  Had to do it. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4919.56s)]
*  And Miles pointed this out. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4920.4400000000005s)]
*  He's like, yo, he must have gone, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4921.88s)]
*  an extra four minutes heard about this thing. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4923.4800000000005s)]
*  And he was like, fuck it, I'm doing a 90-minute speech. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4925.08s)]
*  Just to top it. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4927.0s)]
*  Four more years. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4929.0s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4929.719999999999s)]
*  That was definitely intentional. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4931.4s)]
*  He wanted to have the longest speech ever. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4933.16s)]
*  He'd be like, yo, after I got shot, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4935.0s)]
*  I give a 90-minute speech to Teddy Roosevelt. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4936.04s)]
*  Which is a good move. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4937.4s)]
*  You can't fuck him in. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4938.2s)]
*  But he went off script, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4939.08s)]
*  and then it got a little boring. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4940.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's always hurt Trump in the past, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4942.12s)]
*  going off script. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4943.719999999999s)]
*  No, but it's so funny. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4945.88s)]
*  When he's on script, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4947.719999999999s)]
*  it is not that same excitement that you get from Trump [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4950.2s)]
*  that you get from, let's say, Mike Tyson. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4952.92s)]
*  I think we even said on the pod, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4955.48s)]
*  the most engaging thing a human can do [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4956.68s)]
*  is not let you know the next thing [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4959.16s)]
*  that they're going to say. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4960.76s)]
*  And I think that's why Mike is so engaging. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4962.12s)]
*  It's like, even on the podcast, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4963.88s)]
*  he'll be on fucking pounds of shrooms. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4965.4800000000005s)]
*  And then out of nowhere, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4967.320000000001s)]
*  he'll just start crying and telling you [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4968.280000000001s)]
*  the importance of having no ego. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4969.64s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4970.92s)]
*  You never know what he's going to say next. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4971.88s)]
*  And Trump has that quality. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4973.64s)]
*  But when he's reading off the prompter, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4974.84s)]
*  you limit the superpower. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4977.64s)]
*  But at the same time... [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4981.320000000001s)]
*  They could kind of backfire a little bit on this one. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4983.64s)]
*  Well, I think when he's the underdog, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4985.48s)]
*  the superpower is really helpful. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4987.719999999999s)]
*  When he's the front runner, limit the superpower. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4989.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4991.48s)]
*  And then he started going, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4992.44s)]
*  saying the same things that he says like, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4993.639999999999s)]
*  I'm that dude or whatever. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4996.28s)]
*  Everybody's fucking shit. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4998.04s)]
*  And I'm going to do this and that. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=4999.5599999999995s)]
*  And it kind of took the sincerity out of, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5001.639999999999s)]
*  we feel bad for you right now. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5005.959999999999s)]
*  He should have milked that shit. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5008.2s)]
*  Because he started on reading the teleprompter [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5009.959999999999s)]
*  and it was like, oh shit, this is a new Trump. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5012.839999999999s)]
*  That's how you get the fucking people in the middle. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5015.240000000001s)]
*  He's like, oh shit, okay, maybe he's changed a little bit. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5017.4800000000005s)]
*  And then he went, reverted right back to his old shit. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5020.12s)]
*  I think that kind of hurt. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5022.360000000001s)]
*  That was like a misstep. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5023.16s)]
*  He could have really capitalized on that moment if he's like, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5024.52s)]
*  you know what, after getting grazed in the ear with some glass, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5026.84s)]
*  I'm a changed man. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5031.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, those guys, I hate it, bro. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5032.04s)]
*  Can't even get a shot. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5033.320000000001s)]
*  Hate a shot. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5034.12s)]
*  So he's just, he cannot help but do the funniest thing [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5034.92s)]
*  at all points of time. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5040.12s)]
*  When he walked over to the fireman's outfit [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5040.84s)]
*  and then kissed the helmet. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5044.6s)]
*  I think he's being genuine. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5048.4400000000005s)]
*  I think he's being authentic. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5049.56s)]
*  It just also happens to be the most ridiculous thing [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5051.0s)]
*  to kiss the helmet. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5055.4800000000005s)]
*  That was part of the speech. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5058.76s)]
*  He was like, go over it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5060.12s)]
*  I think he went over to it genuinely. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5062.52s)]
*  But feeling compelled to kiss the helmet. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5067.4s)]
*  I think that's just Trump like, okay, what is the funny thing? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5072.2s)]
*  What's the level? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5075.16s)]
*  Yes, and. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5075.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5076.04s)]
*  The funniest shit is when I sent you where he's doing the speech, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5076.5199999999995s)]
*  he's like, I'm not supposed to be here right now. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5078.599999999999s)]
*  And everyone goes, yes, you are. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5080.12s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5081.96s)]
*  He goes, thank you. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5082.599999999999s)]
*  But I'm not. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5084.2s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5086.04s)]
*  He wouldn't even, he's so stubborn that they're like, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5086.84s)]
*  you're supposed to be here. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5089.08s)]
*  You guys are wrong, actually. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5089.88s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5091.08s)]
*  I've listened to my point. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5091.5599999999995s)]
*  He's just the funniest. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5092.679999999999s)]
*  He can't help it. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5093.8s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5094.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5095.4s)]
*  Okay, so now we get Kamala and we see what happens in the coming weeks, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5097.0s)]
*  the coming months, whatever. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5103.56s)]
*  America is just the most interesting country when it comes to these elections. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5104.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not fucking close. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5107.32s)]
*  This shit is reality TV. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5108.12s)]
*  It's weird that like. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5109.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glued to this shit. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5110.36s)]
*  This is. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5111.88s)]
*  I'm like a little, and this is not good, but I'm a little excited. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5112.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5118.92s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5119.56s)]
*  You shouldn't be excited for what's happening. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5120.2s)]
*  It's not a reality show. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5122.84s)]
*  It's not fucking House of Dragons. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5124.04s)]
*  But there is this part of me that's like, oh, it's happening. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5125.88s)]
*  It's the new season. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5130.04s)]
*  The season finale is coming. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5133.96s)]
*  You think Biden will be able to acknowledge the election results? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5135.56s)]
*  You think he's going to have the mental ability to be like, I won or I lost? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5138.36s)]
*  Oh, dude, the clip of him is seeming like he greets that girl and he thinks it's his wife. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5141.88s)]
*  And then his wife grabs him and is like, no, no, no. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5146.36s)]
*  Have you seen that clip? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5148.04s)]
*  That clip went viral. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5149.56s)]
*  He's talking to some woman and he seems very warm with her. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5150.4400000000005s)]
*  And then his wife comes over, Jill, and kind of pushes him aside. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5153.08s)]
*  And what everybody was saying is he thought that was Jill, like genuinely thought that was Jill. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5156.36s)]
*  There's a picture of every little. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5159.64s)]
*  All due respect, there's a picture of Jill Young. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5161.0s)]
*  That could have been Jill. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5166.28s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5167.88s)]
*  What do these white pictures look like? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5169.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5174.5199999999995s)]
*  Now, that's actually a good move, guys. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5175.8s)]
*  Remember this. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5177.32s)]
*  Yeah, like, oh, I thought it was you. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5177.88s)]
*  We know what you have to my boy. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5181.08s)]
*  You might be smart, bro. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5182.04s)]
*  He almost leaned in. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5182.84s)]
*  Yeah, you saw it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5183.96s)]
*  He came over the finger. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5184.6s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5185.56s)]
*  OK, anything else with politics before we get into before we get into this wedding? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5187.400000000001s)]
*  Diddy needs to hire those people. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5194.92s)]
*  This are well, now the shooter's dead, but hire a bad shooter [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5197.32s)]
*  because that's the only thing that can save his reputation. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5200.76s)]
*  Nothing will save Diddy. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5203.08s)]
*  Yeah, if he gets grazed, you're going to feel a little bit bad. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5203.96s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5208.68s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5209.56s)]
*  Not even a fucking fraction. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5210.28s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5211.72s)]
*  Give me the gun. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5213.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll hit that motherfucker. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5214.200000000001s)]

*  What would you say in terms of history? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5383.08s)]
*  I'm sure there's like royal weddings that were talked about, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5385.320000000001s)]
*  but they weren't, they didn't happen in the social media age. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5388.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5391.240000000001s)]
*  The energy around this wedding. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5391.64s)]
*  It was like trending. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5393.64s)]
*  This was our royal wedding. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5395.08s)]
*  Like when Meghan married Harry and we're all talking, this is dad for Indians. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5396.76s)]
*  Way more opulent because you didn't have to do it in a castle. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5401.08s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5402.84s)]
*  I feel like this was bigger. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5403.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, much more. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5405.08s)]
*  They spent $600 million. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5405.88s)]
*  The reason why I think it was bigger in terms is they could flex in a, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5407.4s)]
*  what's the word that I'm trying to use? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5412.92s)]
*  The royals have to do it in a certain way. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5413.719999999999s)]
*  You can't really get pictures from inside. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5415.5599999999995s)]
*  They have to be dignified. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5416.12s)]
*  It was on TV in America, the royal, we were watching that shit. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5417.4s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5421.639999999999s)]
*  But this shit was on social and TikTok in a way. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5422.28s)]
*  They're also allowed to flex more. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5426.679999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5428.04s)]
*  The flex culture is like, it sort of encouraged, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5428.28s)]
*  whereas like with British aristocracy, flex culture is like discouraged. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5430.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5433.32s)]
*  But I hear what Al is saying, like, yes, it was this huge moment. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5433.96s)]
*  This would be the, this is by far the biggest non-rural wedding in history. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5437.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5441.0s)]
*  It felt royal. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5441.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5443.32s)]
*  You get the invite to go. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5443.8s)]
*  I need to know like a few things right off the bat and I want you to tell me all the stories. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5445.88s)]
*  How many people are at this event? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5450.76s)]
*  9,000 the first day that I was there. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5453.08s)]
*  What? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5455.32s)]
*  Keep going, keep going, keep going. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5456.76s)]
*  I heard the Sunday there was, they were expecting 20,000. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5458.36s)]
*  I didn't feel like it was that much more crowded on the Sunday. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5462.360000000001s)]
*  Maybe we're all just tired. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5465.400000000001s)]
*  So there's 9,000 people at this thing and then as it goes on, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5466.52s)]
*  maybe more and more people are invited. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5469.8s)]

*  Okay. And then it's more exclusive earlier and then gets... [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5477.56s)]
*  See, yeah. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5482.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, you're invited to all. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5483.240000000001s)]

*  A little bit, but I try to remind myself a month before this, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5490.84s)]
*  if you told me at the pre-wedding that I was going to be invited to the wedding, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5494.28s)]
*  I would have been like, you're out of your fucking mind. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5497.64s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5499.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, they're not, they're not famous like Bollywood stars are famous, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5509.08s)]
*  but they're like, imagine Bill Gates really wanted to flex his wealth [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5512.4400000000005s)]
*  and then married another super rich person. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5516.68s)]
*  And then they happen to be friends with all the Hollywood celebrities from childhood. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5519.48s)]

*  Like each floor is its own little city. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5552.6s)]

*  and I was in a little tuk-tuk and you know? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5613.72s)]
*  So the idea is you are a king and you are going to meet your queen. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5615.400000000001s)]

*  I scream his name. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5813.32s)]
*  He did me the fucking courtesy of pretending he didn't hear me. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5816.04s)]
*  But I had to grab myself and go like, you're 40. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5819.24s)]
*  Dude, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5821.56s)]

*  Come on. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5826.6s)]
*  Yeah, I realize athletes are different. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5827.16s)]
*  But I was like, this kid is at least 10 years younger than you. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5828.84s)]
*  This is a child to you. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5831.08s)]

*  Does two of his bangers, leaves. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5890.44s)]
*  Like, if you hear a song that you like, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5892.52s)]
*  it's the motherfucker that did the song, doing the song. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5894.44s)]

*  You didn't recognize me in the first place. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5909.16s)]
*  So I'm having a time in my fucking life, that first day especially. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5910.84s)]
*  Food is crazy, but the problem is in the Barathe, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5914.04s)]
*  you're like walking with everybody. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5916.360000000001s)]
*  And you're trying to kind of, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5917.72s)]
*  I'm so mesmerized by these Bollywood stars. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5918.84s)]
*  I'm like kind of trying to stay around them. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5920.6s)]
*  So we missed all the fire food stands. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5921.96s)]

*  Son is a very sweet kid. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5942.12s)]
*  But I didn't. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5944.12s)]
*  Yeah, Salman Khan is top. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5945.16s)]
*  He might just be as big, maybe. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5947.5599999999995s)]
*  Top two, three probably. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5949.96s)]
*  Top five of all time. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5951.16s)]

*  I just see him kind of standing. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5954.76s)]
*  No security. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5955.88s)]
*  No nothing. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5957.0s)]
*  Just waiting, saying what's up to people, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5957.96s)]
*  wearing like a fucking $900,000 watch [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5959.72s)]
*  or some crazy shit like that. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5962.68s)]
*  Un-fucking-believable. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5964.28s)]
*  Saturday event. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5966.04s)]
*  So because the prime minister comes, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5968.12s)]
*  if you get there after him. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5969.88s)]
*  Modi? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5971.4s)]
*  Modi shows up. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5972.04s)]
*  If you get there after him, they don't let anybody in. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5973.0s)]
*  Obviously, they actually take security seriously in India. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5974.76s)]
*  We didn't get to go to the actual ceremony [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5978.84s)]
*  because he got there fairly quickly. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5981.72s)]
*  And we assume Indian wedding. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5983.96s)]
*  Take an Indian wedding. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5985.16s)]
*  You'd be an hour late. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5985.72s)]
*  But then we go upstairs to this dinner area. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5987.400000000001s)]
*  They have food. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5990.04s)]
*  What was that conversation with you and your wife [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5990.68s)]
*  when you were late because she was getting ready [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5992.360000000001s)]
*  and you missed out on the prime minister? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5994.52s)]
*  I didn't realize how many stars were going to be there. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5996.68s)]
*  I would have been upset if I knew. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=5999.08s)]
*  I thought we were all going to be late. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6000.52s)]
*  I was like, everybody's going to be late. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6001.72s)]
*  Everybody's on time. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6003.0s)]
*  This is one fucking day. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6003.72s)]
*  So then I was tied afterward. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6004.68s)]
*  But we go upstairs. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6006.280000000001s)]
*  You got to flip this and be like, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6007.16s)]
*  nah, we were boycotting on behalf of the job. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6007.72s)]
*  Yeah, we're there for the farmers. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6009.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6011.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're for the farmers here. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6011.4800000000005s)]
*  So we go upstairs. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6013.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like when I say they have food from Dubai [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6015.080000000001s)]
*  and food from Singapore, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6017.72s)]
*  I mean they have restaurants flying in. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6018.6s)]
*  This is cool. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6020.120000000001s)]
*  This is cool. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6020.6s)]
*  You were telling me this. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6021.240000000001s)]
*  And I'm assuming this is like Anand Bhai's favorite places. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6022.6s)]
*  They have Italian food from a restaurant in Dubai. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6024.84s)]
*  There's a guy, asshole Oswell fan, from Singapore, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6027.56s)]
*  has French food. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6031.0s)]
*  The French food from Singapore is catering to things. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6031.96s)]
*  You go sit at a table. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6034.280000000001s)]
*  They bring you whatever you want to. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6035.4800000000005s)]
*  So the food from those restaurants is literally [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6036.92s)]
*  the people from those restaurants went there. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6039.96s)]
*  Which is in a giant ballroom. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6041.96s)]
*  It's like 15 different restaurants with food. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6043.4s)]
*  And outside of the ballroom, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6045.64s)]
*  the entire hallway, 100 yards of desserts. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6046.84s)]
*  They're making fresh waffles. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6049.24s)]
*  They're making crepes. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6050.36s)]
*  They got gelato. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6051.08s)]

*  Like any fucking dessert you can fathom is there. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6056.36s)]

*  They had Indian street food, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6066.52s)]
*  but it wasn't traditional enough. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6067.88s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6069.4s)]

*  we've heard of them. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6131.48s)]
*  She's saying it like we haven't heard of it. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6133.4s)]
*  Big drop off from a*****s to a*****s. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6135.0s)]

*  You know what's funny, though? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6141.16s)]
*  She's probably going to make the greatest ROI on the second one. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6142.2s)]
*  At what point did you look at your girl and be like, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6145.24s)]

*  But you got to, it's good that you were able to stop and just be like, hey, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6167.320000000001s)]
*  a few years ago, we were living together with three roommates on Airbnb to make ends meet. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6172.84s)]
*  And now we are guests. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6179.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, insane. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6181.0s)]
*  I mean, Justine, insane. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6182.6s)]

*  And not to say I'm done or whatever, but like, oh, I, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6189.0s)]
*  this is a thing that I'm going to remember forever. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6192.5199999999995s)]
*  Outside of actual, the craft and specials and all that, this is number one. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6194.84s)]
*  Like, what a fucking- [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6198.68s)]
*  The validation. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6199.72s)]
*  The validation. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6200.599999999999s)]
*  And as a kid who grows up outside of India, you're never really validated by India. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6201.48s)]
*  And it means so much because to Americans, we're Indian. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6206.2s)]
*  And then we go there thinking we're Indian and they're like, no, you're not. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6209.24s)]

*  You're American as fuck. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6212.84s)]
*  So that felt like, yo, and then seeing Bollywood stars, it's like, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6213.96s)]
*  imagine y'all grew up in China and the only connection you have to America is Hollywood [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6217.8s)]
*  movies. Imagine if you went to America and saw Tom Cruise. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6222.360000000001s)]
*  Like, that's the level of what, oh my God, my, this is unbelievable. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6225.96s)]
*  That's what I'm feeling. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6230.2s)]
*  And then, yeah, yeah, we touched on this earlier, but like, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6231.4800000000005s)]
*  I think this, it was also cool when we talked about Anant, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6235.400000000001s)]
*  when I saw him interacting with his wife, genuine love, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6238.6s)]
*  the pictures of them interacting, they're like giddy to be with each other. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6241.96s)]
*  And that was fucking cool because like, yeah, this wedding is about [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6245.24s)]
*  the Imbanis establishing themselves on a global scale. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6248.52s)]
*  It's about changing the perception of India. All these things are happening. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6250.76s)]
*  But it's very cool that it's an actual love wedding. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6253.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6255.96s)]
*  Like, not a love marriage like they fell in love and they'll see if they can make it work, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6256.52s)]
*  but they're like, they've been together since like high school, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6259.56s)]

*  There's a crazy fucking echo on the microphone. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6330.92s)]
*  I'm like, oh boy, here we go. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6333.0s)]
*  Different convention center than the one you were at. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6334.12s)]

*  I get there and he's like, hey, by the way, you can't cuss. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6345.08s)]

*  Good. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6362.04s)]
*  I get, first of all, they're doing some charity auction. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6362.6s)]
*  The chairman of the whole convention keeps complaining about the echo. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6365.8s)]
*  He's like, what's going on? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6369.72s)]
*  He's talking to Mike. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6370.68s)]

*  So I'm like, I got to go to 40 minutes of comedy after this. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6372.6s)]
*  Mark's boy, Ross opened up, shouts to Ross. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6375.08s)]
*  He did his thing, brought me up. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6377.88s)]

*  I'm cussing. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6382.6s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what y'all got to tell me. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6383.16s)]
*  I see all families and there's a six-year-old girl, a seven-year-old girl, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6385.64s)]
*  an 11-year-old girl right in front of me. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6388.52s)]
*  The closest human beings to me. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6392.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6393.96s)]
*  So I'm like, I can't. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6394.52s)]
*  Now I have to perform clean. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6395.8s)]
*  Or you could just auction them. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6397.320000000001s)]
*  That would be a good idea. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6398.6s)]
*  Come on. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6402.04s)]
*  I don't work for Mr. Beast. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6402.360000000001s)]
*  I did like a little crowd work that was like, what do you want to be when you grow up? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6409.0s)]
*  And they were like a teacher. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6411.88s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, that's so sweet. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6412.6s)]
*  I want you to know your parents hate that answer. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6414.04s)]
*  Just little jokes that I could get away with that aren't remotely inappropriate. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6416.28s)]
*  But then I still got to 40 minutes of comedy, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6419.24s)]
*  cognizant of the fact that there's children here. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6421.16s)]
*  That is the worst. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6422.44s)]
*  So for your kids to comedy, sir. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6423.32s)]
*  So any cuss word that isn't a punchline, I have to edit it. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6424.52s)]
*  It's not hitting. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6427.08s)]
*  I got through it. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6428.12s)]
*  They were all very happy afterward. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6428.92s)]
*  But like, hey, yay, yay. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6430.44s)]
*  I should have known when I was doing an Indian gig that it was not going to be worth the money. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6432.68s)]
*  I should have known. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6437.64s)]
*  But it's still such an honor. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6439.08s)]
*  What percent was Indian versus Indian? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6440.36s)]
*  This was so funny. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6441.8s)]
*  If you were Indian, I knew you owned a 7-Eleven. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6443.08s)]
*  And if you were white, I knew you were a vendor trying to get your products into it. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6445.48s)]
*  Into 7-Eleven? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6448.92s)]
*  Oh, that's fucking great. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6449.96s)]
*  Celsius is there. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6451.24s)]
*  They want to slang these drinks. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6452.5199999999995s)]
*  God bless. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6454.28s)]
*  If you're Celsius or you're fucking core water or whatever, every white person is like, oh, no, no. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6455.32s)]
*  But that must have been a wet dream to see all these white people groveling for respect to the? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6460.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6466.04s)]
*  Oh, and even at the Ambani wedding, Europeans are serving me food. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6466.68s)]
*  Like, not even white people, Europeans. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6469.4s)]
*  I mean, what a feeling. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6470.84s)]
*  Just like the white people. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6473.64s)]

*  I'm talking fucking. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6477.8s)]
*  It's like Forrest Gump at the end. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6479.08s)]
*  When she gets the white mate. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6481.56s)]

*  No, I agree with you. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6979.56s)]
*  A mil seven. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6980.280000000001s)]
*  Don't take a mil four. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6981.08s)]
*  One point seven mil for a 4200 square foot loft. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6982.04s)]

*  On the beach. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6987.08s)]
*  Expensive. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6987.72s)]
*  That's I think that's expensive. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6988.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6990.44s)]

*  400,000 square. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=6999.64s)]

*  Yeah, it is an apartment, though. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7002.92s)]
*  It's not like we need a compound. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7005.08s)]
*  I think you need to own the land. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7007.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7009.0s)]
*  We'll get this going. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7011.5599999999995s)]
*  All right, we're going to figure this out. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7012.2s)]
*  That would be fire, though. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7014.76s)]
*  How about y'all? [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7016.52s)]
*  Y'all do anything interesting? [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7017.16s)]
*  Nothing like this. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7019.96s)]
*  Al had trouble with his flights or something. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7020.84s)]
*  Son, no. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7022.6s)]
*  Entire weekend, but it was just that whole outage situation. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7023.24s)]
*  What happened with the outage? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7027.320000000001s)]
*  Microsoft, dude. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7028.84s)]
*  A fucking automatic update, apparently. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7029.8s)]
*  It's a company called Strikeforce, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7032.04s)]
*  and they sent out an automatic update [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7033.64s)]
*  that bricked a lot of computers. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7035.8s)]
*  Blue screened a ton of computers. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7038.2s)]
*  Every computer. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7039.400000000001s)]
*  Basically all computers. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7040.28s)]
*  And the problem was that they can't fix it automatically. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7041.56s)]
*  It wasn't that they, oh, we fucked up. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7043.72s)]
*  We'll resend another update to revert all the computers. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7045.32s)]
*  All the computers had to be manually fixed. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7048.679999999999s)]
*  So like encrypted, you have to put in the 48-digit code [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7051.719999999999s)]
*  to get it back online. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7055.0s)]
*  So if you're like a college with 1,200 computers on it, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7056.599999999999s)]
*  that's a long weekend. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7060.28s)]
*  And then it shut down all the flights. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7062.04s)]
*  It was one of the times where it shut down the most amount [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7065.4s)]
*  of flights since 9-11. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7067.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7069.24s)]
*  It's a crazy amount of flights. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7069.719999999999s)]
*  Every airline except who was Al Askin Air? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7070.679999999999s)]
*  Spirit. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7073.639999999999s)]
*  Now Spirit don't give a fuck. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7074.28s)]
*  They barely run at it. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7075.24s)]
*  They don't update their shit. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7075.96s)]
*  They go by Sexton. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7077.8s)]
*  They're still going by the moon. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7078.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it knocked everything out so no one could fly. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7081.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were delayed as fuck coming from London. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7083.5599999999995s)]
*  But it got resolved fairly quickly. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7085.0s)]
*  It didn't affect my life at all. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7086.28s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7087.8s)]
*  The only way you feel is if you get a flight every day. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7089.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7091.4s)]
*  I was supposed to be back yesterday, [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7092.5199999999995s)]
*  and then I pushed my shit 24 hours. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7093.48s)]
*  So it's still affecting you. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7095.24s)]
*  It's still like a chain effect. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7096.5199999999995s)]
*  Because everything got backed up. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7098.12s)]
*  So now the problem is getting flight crews, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7099.48s)]
*  because they have a certain amount of time [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7101.8s)]
*  they're allowed to work. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7103.16s)]
*  And so when you try to pull people from different crews, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7104.36s)]
*  and then if they're about to go over their time, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7107.4s)]
*  they're like, oh, nah, you can't fly on this plane [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7109.48s)]
*  because it's going to go over the time. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7111.8s)]
*  So now we're missing the long cruise. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7113.24s)]
*  Clear it up by Friday, y'all. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7113.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7116.36s)]
*  It's going to be bad for a while. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7117.48s)]
*  Oh, you think it will be bad for a while? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7118.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's still. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7119.72s)]
*  Oh. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7120.44s)]
*  Yeah, just yesterday. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7121.32s)]
*  Like my flight got pushed 24 hours [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7122.2s)]
*  because they didn't have three crew hours. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7124.44s)]
*  Nah, that's crazy. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7125.32s)]
*  Miles got it the worst. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7126.36s)]
*  Miles bought NCAA football. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7128.36s)]
*  And I paid extra money to play it early. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7131.32s)]
*  You can play it on the Friday, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7133.16s)]
*  or you could pay extra and play it for three days. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7135.4s)]
*  How much extra? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7137.16s)]
*  Like $100. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7138.2s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7152.44s)]
*  Could you play like Sandusky Coach Penn State? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7153.08s)]
*  Ooh, probably. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7155.88s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7157.24s)]
*  Like a Paterno version. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7158.12s)]
*  A what version? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7161.639999999999s)]

*  spent $100 and then couldn't play until the day was available. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7168.84s)]
*  You gotta get that money back, Miles. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7172.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7178.599999999999s)]
*  Microsoft, what the fuck are y'all doing? [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7179.24s)]
*  One of the fun things about the post-truth era [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7180.76s)]
*  is that when these global cataclysms happen, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7184.44s)]
*  we're so desensitized [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7189.16s)]
*  because we're just hearing fucked up shit all the time. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7190.52s)]

*  dude, the president got fucking shot. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7202.6s)]
*  I'm like, oh my god, is paddle going to be open? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7204.200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, no, it's so easy to just be in your bubble. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7207.0s)]
*  And I guess maybe that's what happens to New York [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7210.4400000000005s)]
*  and maybe more so California. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7212.68s)]
*  New York, you actually have to be in the street. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7214.200000000001s)]
*  You have to walk places. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7215.8s)]
*  But imagine you're a rich person from California. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7217.240000000001s)]
*  And you're living most of your life in your house. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7221.24s)]
*  Some shit happens, it's really fucked up, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7226.679999999999s)]
*  but then you go walk on your yard [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7228.28s)]
*  and you look out to this beautiful view, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7229.5599999999995s)]
*  you take a swim in your pool. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7231.08s)]
*  It doesn't feel as annoying. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7232.44s)]
*  It doesn't feel as stressful. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7236.44s)]
*  In New York, you feel it. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7238.36s)]
*  When the Black Lives Matter marches were happening, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7240.12s)]
*  you couldn't avoid it. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7242.679999999999s)]
*  You see it, it's right there. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7244.04s)]
*  They're not feeling that shit in Santa Barbara. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7245.4s)]
*  They're not feeling that shit in San Diego [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7247.8s)]
*  when you're living in this beautiful two-acre house. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7249.8s)]
*  And out there, out East, man, nobody was a fan. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7252.360000000001s)]
*  People were joking around about it. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7255.96s)]
*  They said, yeah, there was assassination [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7259.16s)]
*  in San Juan Trump. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7260.52s)]
*  They shot him five times and missed. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7261.400000000001s)]
*  And then I can't say who, but someone was like, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7263.0s)]
*  yeah, bro, I thought it was Bonnie James that tried to shoot. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7264.76s)]
*  It was people just joking around like it was nothing. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7266.76s)]
*  What is that? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7272.4400000000005s)]
*  Why are we so desensitized with these things that are, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7274.76s)]
*  they should like... [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7277.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was wild how desensitized I was too. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7278.92s)]
*  My initial reaction was like, all right, here we go. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7282.6s)]
*  I just got DOP with yelling. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7285.64s)]
*  That's what I was annoyed by. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7286.92s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7287.88s)]
*  For me, it's the opposite. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7288.92s)]
*  I was just glued to every news station. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7290.36s)]
*  I wanted to get updates, find out all the tea. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7293.32s)]
*  I was interested in tea, don't get me wrong. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7298.36s)]
*  But like, so I had one of my boys hit me, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7299.8s)]
*  and I will protect his identity, but a friend of all of ours. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7303.72s)]
*  And he hit me, he said, you got to get security for your family. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7307.8s)]
*  He goes, get security for your family. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7311.8s)]
*  Shit is about to go down in America. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7313.8s)]
*  Anybody talking about these political issues could potentially be a target. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7315.72s)]
*  You got to be ready. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7319.48s)]
*  You got to lock down. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7321.24s)]
*  Be careful out there. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7322.44s)]
*  I love you, brother. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7323.4s)]
*  And I was like, is Patil going to be the only thing I could think about? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7324.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7328.92s)]
*  Well, I think urgency is a greater thing than importance. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7329.4s)]
*  Explain. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7333.48s)]
*  The president getting shot at is more important than your kids' football game. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7334.6s)]
*  Your kids' football game is more urgent. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7338.360000000001s)]
*  On a grand scale. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7340.76s)]
*  So you're like, yeah, I got to go to my thing today. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7341.64s)]
*  Or I have work or whatever the fuck. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7343.0s)]
*  Yeah, you just, what's in front of you? [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7345.56s)]
*  My whole family lives in the suburbs. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7347.64s)]
*  They were talking about it. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7349.0s)]
*  They're just like, yeah, we had a birthday party for my niece. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7349.8s)]
*  So they all went out and just drank. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7353.16s)]
*  I truly wonder, I remember being younger, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7357.0s)]
*  and I hate to chalk this thing up to having a little bit more financial freedom, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7360.6s)]
*  but I remember being younger, being so invested in everything that happened, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7365.16s)]
*  watching every fucking YouTube video that would come out about this issue and that issue. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7369.96s)]
*  Maybe I just have, I don't know if you guys feel this way, but maybe there's an exhaustion [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7376.12s)]
*  that happens with it. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7381.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7382.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7383.24s)]
*  And- [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7383.88s)]
*  You don't have more shit to tend to. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7384.52s)]
*  That's true. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7386.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have a wife, you have a baby. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7386.84s)]
*  Baby's engaging with me. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7388.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, dude, it's- [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7391.0s)]
*  That's urgent. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7392.2s)]
*  You get to make her laugh and you get you guys, that you connect. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7392.84s)]
*  She spilled some shit for the first time. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7396.2s)]
*  I was like, oh, it's a lit. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7397.8s)]
*  I went and got my wife this coffee that I knew she really wanted, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7400.04s)]
*  and the straw was sticking out of the coffee, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7402.759999999999s)]
*  and she hadn't even taken a sip, and she put her sugar in it, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7404.44s)]
*  and put her cinnamon on top. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7407.0s)]
*  She's ready to have the perfect coffee this shit. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7408.759999999999s)]
*  And I saw the baby reach for the straw, and I was like, get that shit. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7411.0s)]
*  Knocked that whole fucking coffee down. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7415.32s)]
*  I was like, oh, what's happening? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7417.0s)]
*  What is happening? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7419.16s)]
*  The coffee assassination is more interesting. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7420.44s)]
*  Way more. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7422.2s)]
*  It's more urgent. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7423.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7424.12s)]
*  This is kind of fucked up. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7425.08s)]
*  I don't know if we have to cut it, but- [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7426.2s)]
*  So I went to the gun range when I was out in San Diego, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7427.72s)]
*  and I'm like, I wonder how hard that shot was. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7431.56s)]
*  So I tried to put the target out the same distance, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7434.2s)]
*  but the Ranger was at it. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7436.84s)]
*  It only went 100 yards. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7438.36s)]
*  And how far was the shot? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7439.56s)]
*  300 or 400? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7441.16s)]
*  Oh, I thought it was 160 yards. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7442.12s)]
*  That's it? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7443.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7444.44s)]
*  This guy's a loser. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7445.24s)]
*  This guy's a fucking loser. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7447.16s)]
*  It's hard to impress out guys. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7448.92s)]
*  You gotta have a $600 million wedding for our guys to make. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7450.5199999999995s)]
*  Yo, executor don't, dude. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7453.0s)]
*  Execution is worshiped. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7455.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7456.36s)]
*  Literally. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7456.92s)]
*  Execute. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7457.4s)]
*  OK, so you win it. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7458.44s)]
*  So I put it all as far as I can go, 100 yards, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7459.32s)]
*  and I was using a rifle, hit it multiple times. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7462.28s)]
*  Now, not bullseyes, but it's like we had the person target, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7465.96s)]
*  and all shots hit. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7470.2s)]
*  You hit body though, because I saw what you posted on Instagram. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7471.24s)]
*  I was aiming for body. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7473.4s)]
*  But my man was aiming for head. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7474.36s)]
*  He's a hero. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7475.64s)]
*  Well, he's an idiot. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7476.280000000001s)]
*  You can't aim for body. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7477.240000000001s)]
*  Bigger target. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7478.200000000001s)]
*  No, but body, you assume that they got the vestie on. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7479.0s)]
*  You got one of those big ass bullets. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7481.96s)]
*  It goes right through? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7484.12s)]
*  That shit is, that's taking him out. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7484.68s)]
*  Really? [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7486.92s)]
*  Even the, it would go through a, what is it called? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7487.320000000001s)]
*  Kevlar. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7490.4400000000005s)]

*  No. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7504.280000000001s)]

*  So it doesn't happen. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7509.0s)]
*  Either no vest or whatever the best vest is. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7509.16s)]

*  Yeah, three have been shot, four have been assassinated. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7543.32s)]
*  So that's seven. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7545.48s)]
*  I thought we got up to 12 with. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7546.36s)]
*  So then there were other ones where it's like bullets got fired past them. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7548.36s)]
*  And then like someone threw a grenade at Bush one time. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7552.2s)]
*  And the shit just didn't go off because it had a handkerchief wrapped around it. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7555.16s)]
*  Like, there's so many of those. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7558.28s)]
*  So we're looking at, if we got, I think we got to 12 where there was like a bullet [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7560.36s)]
*  actually missed them or hit, but a bullet was shot at. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7564.84s)]
*  A job where 25% of the people are in killable situate, like literally, [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7570.28s)]
*  that's more than ice row truckers. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7577.400000000001s)]
*  That's more than the gas station attendant. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7578.92s)]
*  Like, yeah, this is a, I don't know. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7580.68s)]
*  Maybe I'm detached from how dangerous being president is. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7584.76s)]
*  Most of us are. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7588.68s)]
*  I don't think most of us know the numbers. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7589.16s)]
*  They all have assassinations. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7590.4400000000005s)]
*  Everyone. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7591.96s)]
*  How did Barry, how did Barry make it then? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7592.92s)]
*  Barack? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7595.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, he had a bunch. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7595.88s)]
*  There was a dude that shot bullets, like at the White House, thinking that he was outside. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7596.84s)]
*  And then there was a bunch of other ones that like just got hit. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7602.4400000000005s)]
*  Take the shot you get. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7604.84s)]
*  But there was the thing, I remember when Barack. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7607.64s)]
*  That's like what happened to you with the parking lot shots. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7609.8s)]
*  Like Barack rolling on the ground. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7611.8s)]
*  Everybody's like, fuck off man. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7613.4800000000005s)]
*  They probably got bulletproof glass at the White House. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7614.4400000000005s)]
*  But I remember when we were in DC, there is a restaurant we ate at. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7616.68s)]
*  Do you remember this restaurant we ate at? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7621.24s)]
*  You actually came to the hotel. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7623.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7624.679999999999s)]
*  Capitol? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7625.24s)]
*  I think it was the Capitol Hotel or something like that, or the American Hotel, whatever [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7626.04s)]
*  the fuck it is. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7629.48s)]
*  And it's literally across the street from the White House. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7630.04s)]
*  And at the restaurant that's on the roof, you can look down on the White House. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7632.5199999999995s)]
*  You look down on the lawn, and you look down on, there's the lawn in the front, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7639.639999999999s)]
*  and there's the lawn in the back. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7642.28s)]
*  And I saw that, and I was like, oh, the president just can't walk around. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7643.88s)]
*  Because nobody checked me for weapons or nothing. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7650.12s)]
*  I just walked into this, and I went upstairs to eat calamari. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7652.28s)]
*  If I had anything. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7654.44s)]
*  So when your president- [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7657.0s)]
*  Stop giving them ideas. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7658.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7659.88s)]
*  I feel bad even saying it, but low key, it made me feel like a little bit of empathy [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7660.12s)]
*  for them. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7664.36s)]
*  They are in a shoebox the entire presidency. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7664.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7667.0s)]
*  That's why they go to Camp David. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7667.32s)]
*  And that's why they gotta go to Camp David. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7668.44s)]
*  Camp David is walk around outside. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7670.36s)]
*  Yeah, they can drive on Camp David. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7672.44s)]
*  It's the only place where presidents are allowed to drive a car. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7674.12s)]
*  But then Trump's at his fucking golf shit. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7678.12s)]
*  Because they could block it off. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7680.28s)]
*  For people getting inside. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7682.5199999999995s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7683.48s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7683.88s)]
*  So I'm like, yeah, I need to get out. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7684.599999999999s)]

*  Bro, Gerald Ford almost got murdered by two women at separate times. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7691.08s)]
*  They pulled the gun on him, and one of them misfired, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7694.36s)]

*  That one also misfires, and then Andrew Jackson beats the shit out of him with a can. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7705.4s)]
*  Fire. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7708.84s)]

*  Like, I just want to let y'all know we were all away and we were in the group chat. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7772.68s)]
*  Like, yo, we have to. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7778.36s)]
*  We were in the group chat. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7781.16s)]
*  We're like, yo, we got to come in. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7782.04s)]
*  We got to do this episode. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7783.16s)]
*  Like, this is huge and people are going to need it. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7784.2s)]
*  And my mom texted me because I told her I just went out there and I was like, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7786.12s)]
*  yeah, I'm going to take some time off. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7792.68s)]

*  So I'm going to I'm actually going to go in. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7794.76s)]
*  And my mom texted me this. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7796.68s)]
*  Take the 10 days off. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7798.76s)]
*  Life is short and can end at any moment. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7800.76s)]
*  I'm only your mom. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7804.68s)]
*  So what do I know? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7805.8s)]
*  And my mom had just had surgery. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7807.64s)]
*  And she's just how I know. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7810.28s)]
*  Why are you talking like that? [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7812.44s)]
*  I think it's like she was like she's a tank, like nothing. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7814.599999999999s)]
*  And then she, you know, she has this gallbladder thing. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7819.08s)]
*  They got to take the gallbladder out and like obviously everything with my dad. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7821.08s)]
*  And I think she's starting to realize her mortality a little bit. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7823.8s)]
*  And I remember sitting there and I'm out with my family and my fucking wife and my daughter there. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7827.160000000001s)]

*  I think we've dedicated about 17 straight years to try to achieve everything that we wanted. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7842.360000000001s)]
*  And you've earned a fucking 10 day stretch even though that there was an assassination attempt. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXI7zP3Jn7A&t=7849.56s)]
