*  What's up, everyone? Welcome to Playgrin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=0.0s)]
*  And today that we have Alyssa Deak in the building. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1.92s)]
*  Goat storyteller, one of the best comedians out there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5.12s)]
*  You've seen him on Def Comedy Jam and his Domino Effect specials, four of them. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7.72s)]
*  This is unprecedented the amount of comedy he's actually put out for free for all of you on the internet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11.72s)]
*  He garnered over 35 million views, rave reviews on YouTube. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Aly turned his tough life into comedy gold. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=19.52s)]
*  He's raw, he's real, relentless, no gimmicks, just pure, hilarious storytelling. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=22.12s)]
*  I want to dive in because I feel like what you're experiencing was a lot of us have experienced when we put stuff on YouTube is like, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=27.08s)]
*  you're getting big views, you're selling out these huge fucking venues. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=34.76s)]
*  But there's also this thing where it's like, is it just in our little bubble? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=39.4s)]
*  Have you felt that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=43.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm in a little bubble. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=44.4s)]
*  I don't think it's popped the ceiling yet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=45.92s)]
*  But then you look at the views, if a hundred million people have watched this, what ceiling? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=47.84s)]
*  I'm waiting on India. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=52.4s)]
*  I think with Alys and Deke, you might get Pakistan first. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=53.76s)]
*  I think white people think I'm Indian. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=56.76s)]
*  No way. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=61.76s)]
*  I just recently did Boston. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=62.76s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  When I was a kid, white people couldn't understand that I was, they thought I was black. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  When they were racist toward me, it would be go back to Africa, they would call me the N word. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  And I would be like, I think I'm supposed to be offended. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  What happened in Boston? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=80.76s)]
*  So this is when I was, I hate to put them out there, but because she rectified it, but it was, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=81.76s)]
*  I was at Boston laughs, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=86.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=89.76s)]
*  And two white guys opened for me and I walk out and this white dude was like, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=90.76s)]
*  I thought he was Indian and he just turned his back to the stage. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=97.76s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=102.76s)]
*  How much is this white guy love Indians? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=105.76s)]
*  I think he was more offended that I was black. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=110.76s)]
*  I would have never came if I knew he was black. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=114.76s)]
*  Indian yes, but black no. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=117.76s)]
*  I like how Buzz is just getting a little less racist. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=120.76s)]
*  It's like they've accepted the color spectrum a little bit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=123.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=126.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=127.76s)]
*  And you thought they would get over it with black people? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=128.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=131.76s)]
*  You thought they would get over it with Bill Russell bringing so many championships? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=132.76s)]
*  You know, I'm just like, he's a racist. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=137.76s)]
*  I've thought about this too. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=139.76s)]
*  It's like there might have been a period during Bill Russell's reign because it's not like he didn't just win them as a player. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=141.76s)]
*  He won them as a coach. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=147.76s)]
*  Like I'm wondering what is happening to like the racist people in Boston at that time when he wins what? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=149.76s)]
*  Nine as a player. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=154.76s)]
*  And then they're going to bestow like the most important position for the franchise that they care about. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=156.76s)]
*  The coach. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=162.76s)]
*  So this is my thing against racist black men who argue about Jordan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=163.76s)]
*  Because I think you just this is my problem with it with the whole Bill Russell thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=169.76s)]
*  OK, so somebody said who's one of the greatest coaches of all time? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=174.76s)]
*  They're going to mention Red R.R. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=177.76s)]
*  They're not going to say, oh, it was the era. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=179.76s)]
*  He did it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=182.76s)]
*  No, they're just going to mention him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=183.76s)]
*  This is a great show. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=185.76s)]
*  But when it gets to Bill Russell, he didn't play against nobody. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=186.76s)]
*  He played against everybody in his era. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=189.76s)]
*  Wilton. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=191.76s)]
*  Wilton and everybody else. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=192.76s)]
*  But then when he left, when Red Aarbach left, he became the coach and he played and coached. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=194.76s)]
*  Jordan, there's no way Jordan could have played and coached. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=202.76s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=205.76s)]
*  Yeah, and played 36 holes of golf. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=206.76s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=208.76s)]
*  He had to cut 10 players on the team. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=210.76s)]
*  It's just me and Scottie. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=213.76s)]
*  Everybody else sit down. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=217.76s)]
*  It's amazing how they just try to diminish what he did in basketball. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=219.76s)]
*  He has 11 champions. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=224.76s)]
*  I wonder if part of it is like that was a time I think in the NBA. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=226.76s)]
*  My dad would tell me his story. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=231.76s)]
*  So Bill Russell, my dad saw he was the first person he ever saw dunk a basketball. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=232.76s)]
*  It was like during the layup lines. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=236.76s)]
*  And he was like, I just saw him jump up there dunk. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=238.76s)]
*  He goes to me, Bill Russell is the best player that he ever saw play because he completely changed the game even defensively. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=240.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=246.76s)]
*  But this was a time where my dad would tell me that like when the Knicks were playing at the same time, the what is it with clowns and stuff? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=247.76s)]
*  What is that called? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=255.76s)]
*  The circus. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=256.76s)]
*  The circus. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=257.76s)]
*  When the circus was in town. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=258.76s)]
*  What did they call it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=259.76s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=260.76s)]
*  I almost called it the carnival. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=261.76s)]
*  I forgot the name of that shit. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=263.76s)]
*  I'm about to call it the Barbershop. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=265.76s)]
*  I was about to say. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=267.76s)]
*  No, he told me the Knicks would be bumped out of the garden for the circus. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=268.76s)]
*  For the circus. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=277.76s)]
*  So this is at a time where like I guess basketball. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=278.76s)]
*  Finals are on tape delay apparently. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=281.76s)]
*  Ringling Brothers was huge. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=282.76s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=284.76s)]
*  You got to have your sandals. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=285.76s)]
*  Hey, we're having a circus here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=287.76s)]
*  A little game outside the Ruckers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=290.76s)]
*  Can you tame an elephant? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=292.76s)]
*  No. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=293.76s)]
*  We'll get it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=294.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=295.76s)]
*  I mean, anyway, that was kind of wild times. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=296.76s)]
*  Bill Russell dude that has a picture where he's just wearing all the rings. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=298.76s)]
*  Bro, that's insane. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=301.76s)]
*  Iconic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=302.76s)]
*  More rings and fingers. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=303.76s)]
*  Player and coach. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=304.76s)]
*  Yeah, unreal. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=305.76s)]
*  At a time where they weren't even letting him, I think in certain cities, stay in the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=306.76s)]
*  same hotel as the white players. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=310.76s)]
*  And he did all this in chucks. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=313.76s)]
*  He's playing in both. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=315.76s)]
*  I got a bunion for walking to work. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=318.76s)]
*  He's playing the low top joints. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=321.76s)]
*  That's why they had to dribble like this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=323.76s)]
*  Because I don't think that was only in the crossover. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=325.76s)]
*  You know the craziest Bill Russell stat? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=328.76s)]
*  If I think it's 14 and 0 in game sevens. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=330.76s)]
*  He never lost a game seven. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=333.76s)]
*  Yeah, he just lost. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=334.76s)]
*  Game seven, Bill Russell, you win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=335.76s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=337.76s)]
*  There's nobody else I can think of that ever had that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=338.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=340.76s)]
*  Just were you a big hoop fan growing up? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=341.76s)]
*  Always. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=343.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=344.76s)]
*  Basketball. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=345.76s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=346.76s)]
*  But what was your team? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=347.76s)]
*  Obviously Rockets. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=348.76s)]
*  But like. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=349.76s)]
*  Obviously Rome. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=350.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=351.76s)]
*  You were a Knicks fan? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=352.76s)]
*  Always. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=353.76s)]
*  Is your family originally from New York? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=354.76s)]
*  No. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=356.76s)]
*  You ever seen cowboy fans? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=357.76s)]
*  They all over the world, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=358.76s)]
*  I'm from Dallas. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=359.76s)]
*  I'm just full of my own money. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=360.76s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of it on the set. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=361.76s)]
*  They had to do this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=362.76s)]
*  Man, look who played for the Knicks. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=363.76s)]
*  That's who's on TV. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=364.76s)]
*  You root for the people that are on TV. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=365.76s)]
*  Like remember we were all Braves fans for no reason? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=366.76s)]
*  It was just because they were on TV. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=367.76s)]
*  He was a circus fan when he was growing up. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=368.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know that shit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=369.76s)]
*  It was the art, bro. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=370.76s)]
*  And Dan Patrick Ewing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=371.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=372.76s)]
*  He was a circus fan. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=373.76s)]
*  He was a circus fan. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=374.76s)]
*  He was a circus fan. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=375.76s)]
*  He was a circus fan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=376.76s)]
*  He was a circus fan when he was growing up. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=378.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know that shit. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=379.76s)]
*  It was the art, bro. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=380.76s)]
*  And Dan Patrick Ewing went to the Knicks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=381.76s)]
*  You watch Georgetown and then your player get drafted to the Knicks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=384.76s)]
*  It's like, oh for sure. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=388.76s)]
*  But as a Dallas guy, Houston people are so fucking annoyingly loyal. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=390.76s)]
*  You're a Dallas guy? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=394.76s)]
*  He's from Dallas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=395.76s)]
*  I already love the Cowboys. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=396.76s)]
*  Like what is it? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=397.76s)]
*  I fucking hate them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=398.76s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=399.76s)]
*  I've always hated the Cowboys. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=400.76s)]
*  I love them until about two years ago. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=401.76s)]
*  If they would have drafted Jerry Rice, I still wouldn't have been fucking with the Cowboys. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=403.76s)]
*  I was like, Jerry's good, but fuck the rest of the time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=408.76s)]
*  And that's my favorite football player, Jerry and Deon. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=411.76s)]
*  And I make a strong argument for Deon being one of the greatest, being damn near the greatest player over LT. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=414.76s)]
*  And I'm a Giants fan, but over LT. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=421.76s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=423.76s)]
*  I don't think that's crazy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=424.76s)]
*  Okay, so what is, I think we have to accept that LT at his prime, I think. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=425.76s)]
*  At high cocaine, for sure. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=430.76s)]
*  Why do we diminish the value of cocaine in the excitement of the sport? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=432.76s)]
*  Because remember in like the 80s when the basketball players were just fist fighting on the court? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=441.76s)]
*  Yeah, I thought all of them was high. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=445.76s)]
*  They were. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=447.76s)]
*  They were fighting their ass off. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=448.76s)]
*  And Olajuwon, I remember Olajuwon was still fighting in his era before. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=450.76s)]
*  Olajuwon, it's like nobody wanted to fight the dream. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=456.76s)]
*  You heard the Vernon-Maxwell story? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=459.76s)]
*  You heard Vernon talk about it? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=460.76s)]
*  I know Max. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=461.76s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=462.76s)]
*  And me and Max used to be in the club back in the day. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=463.76s)]
*  But when he said about Olajuwon slapping him, I was like, yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=466.76s)]
*  The dream was like, hey man, stop all that fat mouthing, bro. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=470.76s)]
*  In his broken Nigerian language, bro. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=477.76s)]
*  I've been at the mosque with him. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=481.76s)]
*  At the where? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=486.76s)]
*  At the mosque. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=487.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=488.76s)]
*  So his brothers are bigger than him. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=489.76s)]
*  It's crazy how big his brothers are. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=492.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=495.76s)]
*  But to be next to him in prayer. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=496.76s)]
*  It's a big carpet. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=499.76s)]
*  He's like, yo man, I'm going to go to the back. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=501.76s)]
*  This thing, this thing's like, I can't even concentrate. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=505.76s)]
*  Imagine being right behind those feet. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=509.76s)]
*  Oh man, prayer in the back, bro. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=512.76s)]
*  It's crazy how big he is. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=517.76s)]
*  So wait, were you in Houston going to the mosque while he was playing for the team? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=520.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=525.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=526.76s)]
*  So he was just going to like... [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=527.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he had drafted in 84. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=528.76s)]
*  But I was not there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=529.76s)]
*  I was locked up in 84. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=530.76s)]
*  That's the thing about, I always go back to like, I missed and I hated to. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=531.76s)]
*  Like, people would go to the mosque and pray for me. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=534.76s)]
*  And let me tell you, the terrible thing about this, they play in the Knicks. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=537.76s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=541.76s)]
*  Painful memory for all of you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=543.76s)]
*  I'm the only one in a Texas prison rooting for the Knicks. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=545.76s)]
*  Oh, you just want your life to be hard, bro. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=550.76s)]
*  So when the Knicks lose, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=555.76s)]
*  I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=560.76s)]
*  When the Knicks lose, it's like everybody in the cafeteria was waiting. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=565.76s)]
*  They weren't even eating. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=570.76s)]
*  They were just... [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=571.76s)]
*  As soon as I came in, I was like, I'm going to play shit. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=572.76s)]
*  And then I remember when San Antonio was playing the Knicks, I had on a Knick jersey. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=578.76s)]
*  I'm performing at this club downtown and I'm with Rodney Winfield. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=582.76s)]
*  He's a legend. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=586.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=587.76s)]
*  And this is how he talked. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=588.76s)]
*  Rodney was like, God damn, why don't you just take off the goddamn jersey? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=589.76s)]
*  Because I'm walking downtown and everybody fucking with me because the Knicks lost to San Antonio. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=594.76s)]
*  He said, man, just take off the jersey, bro, because I can't fight with you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=598.76s)]
*  I'm over it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=602.76s)]
*  He's looking out for himself. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=604.76s)]
*  He's not even worried about you. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=605.76s)]
*  Yo, okay. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=607.76s)]
*  I've seen so many videos. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=608.76s)]
*  You can obviously tell these great stories. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=610.76s)]
*  I think there's a little part of me as a comedian, like if ever, God forbid, I got locked up, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=612.76s)]
*  I'm like, oh, what if I could use my comedy abilities to lighten the mood in the jail or whatever? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=618.76s)]
*  And I'm watching. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=623.76s)]
*  I know it's so stupid, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=624.76s)]
*  But I'm very curious because a lot of your stories you're talking about kind of teasing people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=626.76s)]
*  At what point do you build up the courage to be like roasting guys who are locked up probably for some dangerous shit? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=631.76s)]
*  Is there ever a point where you're like, man, that's not the guy I'm going to tease? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=641.76s)]
*  Like, how do you build rapport to be yourself? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=645.76s)]
*  I knew coming in, you know, I was there for like six. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=649.76s)]
*  So the first two hours making my bones. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=653.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=656.76s)]
*  So people understood he's going to say whatever he's going to say, regardless. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=657.76s)]
*  Fighting him is not the way to go because you grew up boxing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=661.76s)]
*  Right. Okay. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=666.76s)]
*  So I can and I know mass majority of people can't fight. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=667.76s)]
*  I like I know it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=670.76s)]
*  So I'm like this. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=672.76s)]
*  I'm like, like, you really want to do this? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=673.76s)]
*  So you weren't scared at all? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=676.76s)]
*  I've never been scared. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=677.76s)]
*  Not even in the beginning. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=678.76s)]
*  You tell this great story is one of the first thing I saw on our show about the Mexicans are wearing boots. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=680.76s)]
*  I was I was unaware, but not scared. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=686.76s)]
*  I wanted to know what it means. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=688.76s)]
*  I'm like, have you have you guys seen that? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=690.76s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=692.76s)]
*  I just was unaware. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=694.76s)]
*  So in Domino Fake 3, that's why it's damn near my favorite one, because it's showing how unaware I was when I got locked up in the county. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=696.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm so unaware of how this the process when dudes at the balls like, you know, you slapped my sister. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=703.76s)]

*  Yeah. I'm a stop. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=833.76s)]
*  I'm whoop your ass when you come in and I'm I'm like, oh, am I the only one this hallway? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=834.76s)]
*  Oh, so they talking to me. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=839.76s)]
*  Oh, OK. So my first thing is like, yo, as soon as I get in there, we're going to we're going to see. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=841.76s)]
*  Because I do not like to be. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=848.76s)]
*  Then you have a friend who was like, Jack and tall. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=850.76s)]
*  That's Brian. Brian became my friend, too. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=853.76s)]
*  It's Poo Poo and Brian. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=855.76s)]
*  And this is this is the shit that they do to bother people when they get ready to come in. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=857.76s)]
*  So as soon as I get in, I put my stuff down and I'm like, yo, what's up? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=864.76s)]
*  And dudes like, what? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=869.76s)]
*  I said, you said I slapped your sister. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=871.76s)]
*  I'm fucking with you. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=873.76s)]
*  I'm like, yo, but I'm still want to fight because you you made up this narrative about me. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=875.76s)]
*  And I just want I just want to get it on. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=882.76s)]
*  I don't have it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=884.76s)]
*  But I used to hear about this tank when I was in the street. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=885.76s)]
*  Tim B3 is 1301 Franklin Street. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=888.76s)]
*  This is a notorious place. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=891.76s)]
*  OK, and you would hear about it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=894.76s)]
*  They'd be squabbling in 10. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=895.76s)]
*  You would hear about it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=896.76s)]
*  And people say you don't want to go to a corner tank. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=898.76s)]
*  And so when they're assigning people tanks and I'm just sitting there, I'm standing there, giving all these people these other floors. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=901.76s)]
*  He get right to me and say, Tim B3, I'm like, ain't that some bullshit? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=908.76s)]
*  So that's my that was my whole thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=913.76s)]
*  I still wanted to fight. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=916.76s)]
*  And did you guys end up? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=917.76s)]
*  No, because they was just bothering me. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=918.76s)]
*  So then maybe I'm in this tank for about what? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=920.76s)]
*  Fight my case about five, six months. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=923.76s)]
*  Now I'm doing the same shit. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=925.76s)]
*  Tell other people that's him. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=927.76s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=929.76s)]
*  OK, so you get convicted because you end up going to prison. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=932.76s)]
*  OK, upon conviction, you get convicted. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=939.76s)]
*  Upon conviction, you say you've never been afraid, but you have to be like processing outcomes, right? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=942.76s)]
*  Like, are you worried about, oh, I'm going to bump into this person who has beef with a friend of mine on the outside? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=947.76s)]
*  Like, I don't really have a lot of beef. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=953.76s)]
*  So now my crew was protected, but my whole crew was locked up. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=955.76s)]
*  They got all of us at one time. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=959.76s)]
*  So it was a homecoming. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=960.76s)]
*  So it was like, yo, all of y'all come on this way. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=961.76s)]
*  So I really wasn't concerned about that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=964.76s)]
*  Wasn't really the last drug deal you were like legitimately? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=967.76s)]
*  That was legitimate. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=970.76s)]
*  I was done. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=971.76s)]
*  And you got pulled into one last. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=972.76s)]
*  It was like a moment. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=974.76s)]
*  And I wasn't even supposed to be in this shit. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=975.76s)]
*  Like, I was literally out. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=977.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=979.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=980.76s)]
*  You were out. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=981.76s)]
*  You decided you're doing something else. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=982.76s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=984.76s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=985.76s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=986.76s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=987.76s)]
*  I'm cool. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=988.76s)]
*  And he's like, yo, man, just do this last round and watch my back. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=989.76s)]
*  And I'm like, OK. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=991.76s)]
*  And then I'm there. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=992.76s)]
*  And I kept saying it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=994.76s)]
*  Like, we never would have been locked up if Mo would have listened to me and wasn't on [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=996.76s)]
*  his. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1002.76s)]
*  See, when people have financial woes, they make bad decisions. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1003.76s)]
*  Yeah, desperation. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1006.76s)]
*  You know, you get attitude with your friends. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1007.76s)]
*  You got all this other shit. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1009.76s)]
*  So I get there. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1010.76s)]
*  And we in this hotel room and they won't let me go to the bathroom. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1012.76s)]
*  They say they told something wrong. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1017.76s)]
*  They told it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1018.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1020.76s)]
*  And this is just me processing all of it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1021.76s)]
*  So when we sit down and they bring out the money, the first thing I asked, wow, hundreds [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1024.76s)]
*  and fifties. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1032.76s)]
*  This is a drug deal. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1033.76s)]
*  Hundreds and fifty. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1035.76s)]
*  I'm like, oh, that's weird. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1036.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1038.76s)]
*  Because lower amounts would indicate when you sell drugs, it's going to be a lot of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1039.76s)]
*  tens and fives and twenties and sliced up. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1045.76s)]
*  That's what you're getting paid in. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1048.76s)]
*  You got clean bills is probably coming from the sting. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1050.76s)]
*  And it's it's clean bills. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1053.76s)]
*  And I asked, I say, hey, what's these numbers on the money? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1055.76s)]
*  And he said, oh, man, we just that's a bank numbers came from the Franklin Bank in New [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1059.76s)]
*  Orleans. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1065.76s)]
*  I just left New Orleans. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1066.76s)]
*  And I'm like, Franklin Bank, Franklin, Franklin. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1067.76s)]
*  I said, OK, so I thumbed through the money and then I did the sign. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1071.76s)]
*  I knocked on the table three times, which in this was a tell Moe. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1076.76s)]
*  This is the police. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1081.76s)]
*  We've done this. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1082.76s)]
*  Let's deal. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1083.76s)]

*  And let's get back to the show. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1250.76s)]
*  How you and Charles became friends is the funniest story. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1252.76s)]
*  This might be my favorite story in the whole special. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1255.76s)]
*  Tell it, tell it, tell it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1258.76s)]
*  Charles is running an apartment. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1260.76s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1262.76s)]
*  He's the supplier for most everybody in the apartment. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1265.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1268.76s)]
*  They're selling this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1269.76s)]
*  What we live at is maybe, one, two, three, like six sets of apartments. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1270.76s)]
*  Everybody got their own little section. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1275.76s)]
*  But the Greens is where nobody goes. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1277.76s)]
*  They swear the police is over there. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1281.76s)]
*  So I'm buying my dope from Ranelle, which is Charles' brother-in-law. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1283.76s)]
*  And they in the crew. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1291.76s)]
*  You don't generally meet Charles. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1293.76s)]
*  You don't really meet Charles. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1295.76s)]
*  You just meet Ranelle. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1296.76s)]
*  You probably don't want to. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1297.76s)]
*  So I'm buying my little stuff from Ranelle. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1298.76s)]
*  And I decided to go to the Greens. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1301.76s)]
*  And how I go to the Greens is because it's a homosexual guy named Tink. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1304.76s)]
*  That tells Ranelle it was very sassy. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1310.76s)]
*  He was selling, he was buying stuff from Ranelle. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1319.76s)]
*  And he was like, Ranelle, why I gotta buy my cracks over my wife? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1322.76s)]
*  He's fucking crazy. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1327.76s)]
*  The outfit is, Tink must have been like a fan of Simmons, Richard Simmons. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1333.76s)]
*  Because he had on these little bitty ass Carl Lewis shorts, right? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1343.76s)]
*  And these leg warmers. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1347.76s)]
*  And he had a curl that really didn't take. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1349.76s)]
*  So it was just wet hair. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1352.76s)]
*  He had on a half-shirt that said, Thriller. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1354.76s)]
*  He's terrible. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1360.76s)]
*  But when he bought, I run around and catch him in the parking lot. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1365.76s)]
*  And I was like, hey Tink, people over there tonight? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1369.76s)]
*  Yeah, we over there. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1372.76s)]
*  All you gotta do is come over there. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1373.76s)]
*  I bring you everybody. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1375.76s)]
*  So when I get to the pool, I get to the pool area. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1377.76s)]
*  He told me to wait at the pool. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1379.76s)]
*  And it's like, yo, he wasn't lying. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1381.76s)]
*  It was so many fiends over there. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1383.76s)]
*  They start coming out like Thriller. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1386.76s)]
*  Like Michael Jackson. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1388.76s)]
*  So I'm over there, son. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1390.76s)]
*  So now you're making money. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1392.76s)]
*  So you're servicing this area that nobody went to because they thought the cops were over there. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1394.76s)]
*  But it was really just gay people. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1398.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1400.76s)]
*  Tink is the only one that's gay. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1401.76s)]
*  You want to take one. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1403.76s)]
*  Everybody else is just regular people. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1405.76s)]
*  Tink is the only one over there with this bullshit. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1407.76s)]
*  You've seen Thriller. You buy one, you're gay. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1410.76s)]
*  So in Ronel, notices that I'm buying more from him. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1412.76s)]
*  You know, very rapidly. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1417.76s)]
*  So Charles wanted to meet me and we had everybody hang out the park. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1419.76s)]
*  I don't know why drug dealers take over a park. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1423.76s)]
*  It's very... [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1425.76s)]
*  They like the greenery. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1427.76s)]
*  It's not even a green park. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1429.76s)]
*  This is a park in an apartment where they put down some like rug. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1431.76s)]
*  That's a structure on top of it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1437.76s)]
*  This is great. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1440.76s)]
*  They're doing their best. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1442.76s)]
*  You can look and see the pool. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1444.76s)]
*  So I'm over there and Charles wanted to meet me. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1446.76s)]
*  And I came over there to buy something from Ronel. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1450.76s)]
*  And Charles keeps trying to talk to me. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1454.76s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I don't want to talk to him. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1456.76s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1458.76s)]
*  Because this is like Nino Brown. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1459.76s)]
*  Oh, that's the top guy. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1461.76s)]
*  I don't... [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1462.76s)]
*  And Charles said, hey, man, what's up, little man? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1463.76s)]
*  I'm like, hey, can I just get my stuff so I can go? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1465.76s)]
*  And then Charles like, hey, man, he told me that I was going to work for him. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1468.76s)]
*  Because I was selling so much. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1473.76s)]
*  He said, hey, man, you're going to work for me. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1475.76s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm pretty cool. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1477.76s)]
*  You said no to it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1480.76s)]
*  And then Charles, at the time, I didn't know what this gun was. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1481.76s)]
*  You know, I found out later. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1484.76s)]
*  But this was the biggest gun I had ever seen, which was a Desert Eagle. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1486.76s)]
*  It comes from a Desert Eagle. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1490.76s)]
*  And he pulls his gun out. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1492.76s)]
*  He's like, hey, man, what I say you going to do, you going to work for me. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1493.76s)]
*  And I had a 25 automatic that I had two weeks prior gotten to this dude and took his gun. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1498.76s)]
*  His gun fell out. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1508.76s)]
*  Not a crack head. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1509.76s)]
*  Not a fell out. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1510.76s)]
*  And he took the gun. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1511.76s)]
*  And I kept it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1512.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1513.76s)]
*  It's like a video game. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1514.76s)]
*  So when he pulled out his gun, I pulled mine out. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1515.76s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm not going to work for you. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1519.76s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1522.76s)]
*  A guy points a Desert Eagle at you. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1524.76s)]
*  And then in that time, you take out your gun and point it back at him. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1526.76s)]
*  Is there any concern that normal people without you have for some reason have like no fear. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1530.76s)]
*  You have high fear tolerance. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1536.76s)]
*  But normal people would be like, if I pull out my gun, this person is just going to shoot me and then I'll die. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1538.76s)]
*  Why were you not worried that that was going to happen? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1542.76s)]
*  Because he got to shoot. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1544.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1546.76s)]
*  You got to shoot. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1547.76s)]
*  You can't pull something on me. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1548.76s)]
*  You got to shoot. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1549.76s)]
*  I actually have heard this. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1550.76s)]
*  If you pull the gun out and don't shoot, some people say like they're not willing to shoot in the first place. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1551.76s)]
*  I've been. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1556.76s)]
*  I have had a gun put on me three times and I've never been shot by either person. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1557.76s)]
*  This is actually the worst thing to happen because now you're probably too confident. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1563.76s)]
*  You said either person, which lets me know someone pulled it on you twice. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1566.76s)]
*  But that's three different people. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1568.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1572.76s)]
*  And if my boy, Kid Styles, Kid Styles, he was like, yep, this is what happened. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1573.76s)]
*  I do pull the gun on me because I was ribbing on him in the parking lot. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1577.76s)]
*  This is what I'm getting at. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1581.76s)]
*  You're going to be the first to shoot. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1583.76s)]
*  He gets mad because I'm talking about him in the parking lot and he pulls his gun on me. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1585.76s)]
*  And I looked towards Kid, I said, Kid, he about to get his ass whooped. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1591.76s)]
*  And I turned and I said, hey, you better put that gun up before I fuck around and get mad out here. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1596.76s)]
*  And then I just turned back, talking to Kid. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1602.76s)]
*  And he put his gun and Kid was like, yo, you are a crazy man. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1604.76s)]
*  I said, man, if he was going to shoot, he would have shot. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1610.76s)]
*  Because if I pull out on you, I'm going to shoot your ass. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1614.76s)]
*  I'm for 100% going to shoot you. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1618.76s)]
*  It's not even a doubt in my mind that I'm going to shoot you. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1622.76s)]
*  I'm going to blow your fucking brains out. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1626.76s)]
*  Because in my mind, I can't pull a gun on you and not shoot you. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1628.76s)]
*  That's me. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1633.76s)]
*  But what happened in this situation where he pulled the gun out? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1634.76s)]
*  We're in the middle of Jamaica, Jamaica. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1636.76s)]
*  It's a club. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1638.76s)]
*  All these people out here, you're not fucking going to shoot me. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1639.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1642.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1643.76s)]
*  So you were telling Charles, you were basically like, listen. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1644.76s)]
*  Oh, with Charles, that was another person. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1646.76s)]
*  But going back to Charles, when he pulled, when I pulled my gun out, Charles is a big dude. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1648.76s)]
*  He's not a small dude. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1654.76s)]
*  Charles snatched my gun out of my hand and said, this motherfucker got hard. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1656.76s)]
*  And I'm still sitting there with my hand like this. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1662.76s)]
*  You just got your gun finger up and no gun. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1665.76s)]
*  And the way he says it in specials first, he's like, this motherfucker, this landward put a gun on me. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1669.76s)]
*  He's laughing about it, then snatches it. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1673.76s)]
*  This shit is like, it is mine. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1675.76s)]
*  I just got hard and I didn't pull the gun on him. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1679.76s)]
*  He don't give a shit. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1681.76s)]
*  So he respected it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1682.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1683.76s)]
*  And then gave me my gun back and told me, man, fuck what you made. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1684.76s)]
*  You let me know. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1687.76s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1688.76s)]
*  So do you think a guy like him is so feared that he's actually looking for people with heart? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1689.76s)]
*  He's looking for people with heart. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1694.76s)]
*  And especially you're like 16 at the time, right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1695.76s)]
*  14 I think. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1697.76s)]
*  Oh, 14. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1698.76s)]
*  So the young ones, you want to get them early. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1699.76s)]
*  And if you see a young guy with heart, you're like, I can school this guy up. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1701.76s)]
*  Is he going to be with you or against you? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1706.76s)]
*  I can teach him whatever he needs to know, too. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1708.76s)]
*  Like, I can teach him all that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1709.76s)]
*  Now, were you calculating that in the moment? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1711.76s)]
*  Were you like, I have to show him that I'm not scared? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1713.76s)]
*  It was just a knee jerk. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1716.76s)]
*  It was just a reaction of you pulled the gun on me and, okay, I got a gun, too. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1717.76s)]
*  And your shit got a flash, though. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1724.76s)]
*  Because if this shit get crazy, I'm going to shoot you. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1727.76s)]
*  Now, I may not hit you because it's a 25, which is the most inaccurate of a gun of all time. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1730.76s)]
*  But it's the fact. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1737.76s)]
*  Well, I've already acclimated myself to what's going on out here. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1740.76s)]
*  At first, I was very naive to it, but I've been through some little instances out here, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1744.76s)]
*  so I got to get my shit together. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1750.76s)]
*  Even at 14 years old? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1752.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1753.76s)]
*  Drug dealing is not an easy thing. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1754.76s)]
*  If I would go back to 14 in this whole situation, I would just hoop, play the violin. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1756.76s)]
*  Violin. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1763.76s)]
*  I would do so. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1764.76s)]
*  Give me a harp. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1765.76s)]
*  Let me train my mind for something else. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1767.76s)]
*  And the crazy thing is I never had to be out there. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1770.76s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking, both your parents and your mom successful. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1773.76s)]
*  Your dad, was it like a courier service? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1776.76s)]
*  Yeah, a carrier service. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1779.76s)]
*  My dad never sold crack. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1781.76s)]
*  He only sold powder. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1783.76s)]
*  That's who he was doing all this carrier stuff for with these attorneys. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1784.76s)]
*  And they, could you give me some powder? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1788.76s)]
*  And then he started selling powder. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1790.76s)]
*  Because he's selling it to the attorneys. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1793.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1794.76s)]

*  At this time, I'm 19. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1857.76s)]
*  So 19 years old, quarter million dollars in cash. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1859.76s)]
*  So I'm going to say 18 because I'm about to get out before, because my birthday is October 17th. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1862.76s)]
*  So I turned 19. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1868.76s)]
*  We get busted on the 21st. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1871.76s)]
*  So I was only like 19 on the street for like four days. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1873.76s)]
*  It's a terrible present. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1879.76s)]
*  That's the question I have when I'm watching though. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1881.76s)]
*  You got 230 cash. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1883.76s)]
*  Afterward, you're like, I'm out. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1884.76s)]
*  That's not quite enough that you could just invest it and be like set for life. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1886.76s)]
*  Where you got there from? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1890.76s)]
*  No, dude, at the time, like we're talking about 80s. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1891.76s)]
*  That's probably one million dollars now. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1894.76s)]
*  So you're going to spend the rest of your life with 230 cash? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1895.76s)]
*  No, you start a business. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1896.76s)]
*  You can make it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1897.76s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm about. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1898.76s)]
*  So what is your plan beyond this? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1899.76s)]
*  You have a plan like I'm going to do? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1901.76s)]
*  I had all type of shit going on. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1903.76s)]
*  Like I wasn't just making money from selling dough. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1905.76s)]
*  I had a condo my mama didn't even know about. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1908.76s)]
*  I could have released that out. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1910.76s)]
*  I had all type of shit going on. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1912.76s)]
*  Like I had invested in this rap group. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1914.76s)]
*  I had a lot of shit going on. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1916.76s)]
*  So that's what I was wondering. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1918.76s)]
*  Because I know you stopped at like 16. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1920.76s)]
*  You got to think of 230 in the 90s, the early 90s. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1922.76s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1926.76s)]
*  In Texas. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1927.76s)]
*  That's true, Texas too. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1928.76s)]
*  19, that's a lot. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1930.76s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1932.76s)]
*  I'm curious if he doesn't get locked up. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1933.76s)]
*  Is there a point when he's like 25 or 23 where he's like, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1935.76s)]
*  man, I was making so much money before I could go right back to that? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1939.76s)]
*  Because that is kind of what happened at 16, right? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1942.76s)]
*  We were dating that girl. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1944.76s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1945.76s)]
*  And the money gets low. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1946.76s)]
*  I was chilling. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1947.76s)]
*  I was get out. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1948.76s)]
*  I'm looking for you, baby. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1950.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1951.76s)]
*  So that's 16. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1954.76s)]
*  And I'm a kid. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1956.76s)]
*  I'm super kid at this point. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1959.76s)]
*  I'm just in high school. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1960.76s)]
*  Now just move up to night. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1962.76s)]
*  I'm out of school. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1963.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1964.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1965.76s)]
*  And I'm moving around and I'm good. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1966.76s)]
*  I got 230 cash. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1968.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1970.76s)]
*  You know how many investments I could have started anything at that point. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1971.76s)]
*  Did you have to manage street politics at that age? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1973.76s)]
*  Like, did you maintain business relationships with other like rivals? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1977.76s)]
*  Were you well liked? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1981.76s)]
*  I was mostly, I'm a kid, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1982.76s)]
*  so it's not a lot of people who know me. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1984.76s)]
*  I was a kid. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1987.76s)]
*  I was a kid. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1988.76s)]
*  I'm a kid. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1989.76s)]
*  So it's not a lot of people who know me. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1990.76s)]
*  Charles is the main front face. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1993.76s)]
*  But I think that sometimes people get the errors mixed up. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1996.76s)]
*  See, the early, this is early, late 80s, early 90s. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2000.76s)]
*  It's not like whatever this shit is now or in the middle of 2000s. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2004.76s)]
*  I didn't have to know anybody because you, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2010.76s)]
*  nobody's coming from their side of town to my side of town. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2013.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2017.76s)]
*  I'm not even going three streets over. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2018.76s)]
*  That's not my business. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2021.76s)]
*  Now it's so interconnected. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2022.76s)]
*  But before it was neighborhood by neighborhood. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2024.76s)]
*  It was like people was trying to take over. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2026.76s)]
*  You're trying to take over a city now. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2028.76s)]
*  But then it was, I just need my block, my apartments. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2030.76s)]
*  And the apartment complex, you know how many people in an apartment complex? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2035.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2038.76s)]
*  You got everybody that you need right in front of you. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2039.76s)]
*  And I wouldn't even find out what people were doing until Memorial Day. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2041.76s)]
*  Memorial Day is when all the drug dealers and successful ones go to the beach, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2045.76s)]
*  go to Galveston and kick everybody off. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2051.76s)]
*  And you just go in and this is when you show your car off. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2054.76s)]
*  What kind of car you got, who you with, all this, your whole crew. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2057.76s)]
*  So that's how you knew, hey, man, what's up, Sherman? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2062.76s)]
*  People that you know, or you go to the club and you see people who, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2065.76s)]
*  I was never supposed to be in anybody's club. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2069.76s)]
*  But I've been in the club since I was 15. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2073.76s)]
*  I never was supposed to be in the club. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2076.76s)]
*  Was there ever a moment where you're 15, 16 years old [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2078.76s)]
*  and there's grown women that you have access to? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2081.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2084.76s)]

*  So it was right there. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2088.76s)]
*  Basically. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2089.76s)]
*  Basically. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2090.76s)]

*  By 19, you got a quarter million. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2100.76s)]
*  But I had a, my girlfriend was a girl that I went to high school with. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2102.76s)]

*  She was the only person that ever used her ass straight. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2148.76s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2152.76s)]
*  I wasn't drinking. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2153.76s)]
*  I wasn't smoking weed. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2155.76s)]
*  I wasn't doing anything. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2156.76s)]
*  I was just a dude who just, I wasn't even in the streets like that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2157.76s)]
*  I was the person that picked up the money now. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2163.76s)]
*  So you had other guys working for you? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2165.76s)]
*  You got other, in this operation, you got you scaled up. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2167.76s)]
*  Who got you into the life? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2170.76s)]
*  Like, how did that happen? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2172.76s)]
*  Nobody got me into it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2173.76s)]
*  You outside. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2175.76s)]
*  His shoes got made fun of. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2176.76s)]
*  That's what, you outside. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2178.76s)]
*  I relate to that because it's like, I don't have a similar story, but not, nowhere to the level where you were at. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2179.76s)]
*  But just doing knucklehead shit. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2184.76s)]
*  And I didn't need to do it at all. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2185.76s)]
*  Like, I was good at home. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2187.76s)]
*  My mom had no idea of the stuff I was doing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2189.76s)]
*  That's why one of the funniest stories is when you actually get locked up and you have to call your mom and tell her. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2191.76s)]
*  Didn't want to call her at all. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2195.76s)]
*  My mom had no idea I was doing any of the shit that I was doing. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2196.76s)]
*  It's so great. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2200.76s)]
*  That's the worst thing when you got to call and reveal your fucked up life. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2201.76s)]
*  And I was there for really two weeks before I called my mom. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2206.76s)]
*  So you didn't go home for two weeks. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2211.76s)]
*  Your mom's probably weird. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2213.76s)]
*  I didn't live with my mom. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2214.76s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2215.76s)]
*  So she's used to you not at least. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2216.76s)]
*  She used to me not. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2217.76s)]
*  Were you still calling her like, hey, what's up, just checking in? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2218.76s)]
*  No. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2221.76s)]
*  I was in the jail. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2222.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2223.76s)]
*  I'll tell you where it's from. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2224.76s)]
*  I'm hoping. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2225.76s)]
*  The way you did that first call, didn't you do a three way? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2226.76s)]
*  So it did. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2228.76s)]
*  I'm talking about a buffer. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2229.76s)]
*  I'm talking about a buffer, man. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2231.76s)]
*  Because this is terrible, man. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2234.76s)]
*  Okay, so what happens when you tell it? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2236.76s)]
*  Oh, my mom is pissed. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2238.76s)]
*  She is like, yo. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2240.76s)]
*  How do you break it to her? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2243.76s)]
*  What is the first thing you say? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2245.76s)]
*  You told me I needed to be out when I was 18. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2247.76s)]
*  I said, man, they say I was selling drugs. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2249.76s)]
*  They say, what the fuck you mean they say? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2253.76s)]

*  It was just terrible, man. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2263.76s)]
*  Now, does she immediately, is she furious? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2265.76s)]
*  Does she step into mom mode where she's like, I need to protect you? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2269.76s)]
*  She cries first. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2272.76s)]
*  Oh, that's heartbreaking. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2273.76s)]
*  And you on the phone like this. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2274.76s)]

*  And she's like, what you at? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2296.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm in the county, man. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2298.76s)]
*  What's your bond? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2300.76s)]
*  She was like, and I'm like, hey, we can make this bond. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2302.76s)]
*  And she's like, what? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2305.76s)]
*  Man, you don't remember I used to come to your house and plant stuff in your garden. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2309.76s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're going to have to dig them begonias up. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2314.76s)]
*  My mom was pissed. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2319.76s)]
*  That line killed me in the spell. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2322.76s)]
*  You can't dig up them begonias. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2324.76s)]
*  I cackled. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2325.76s)]
*  She was pissed, bro. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2326.76s)]
*  My mom was. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2328.76s)]
*  Because she, it's like real time, I was not honoring everything that she had been through to make our life good. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2329.76s)]
*  And I think that's what people don't think about. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2340.76s)]
*  Just like even now, these kids that's in the streets, you don't want to honor your family. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2344.76s)]
*  Family sacrifice. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2350.76s)]
*  You'd rather do some dishonorable shit. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2351.76s)]
*  And to appease people that don't really have any type of, they have nothing to do with your life. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2353.76s)]
*  Akash had like, we were just talking about your specials. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2363.76s)]
*  And Akash had like, I thought a really great take on especially domino effects. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2367.76s)]
*  And I want you to say more about like this idea that like you take accountability for your actions. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2372.76s)]
*  A lot of times, you know, especially in comedy, a lot of us are talking about the things that have forced us into these situations. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2378.76s)]
*  We are the victims. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2384.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2385.76s)]
*  And it's like so sad for me. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2386.76s)]
*  It's like a cool, rare take where it's like, no, I made these decisions and I did this stuff. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2387.76s)]
*  And I think it's very easy to be like, society made me or these things made me. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2392.76s)]
*  But even now, as you talk about, you're like, no, no, I disrespected my mom's sacrifice. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2398.76s)]
*  She did everything that she could have done to make me not do these things. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2403.76s)]
*  I thought that that was, I thought that's a brave take. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2407.76s)]
*  I think that's a huge thing about honor. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2409.76s)]
*  And so when you hang out with other ethnic groups, other cultures, they have a big thing. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2414.76s)]
*  Like, I don't know not one Pakistani guy that I ask a person to know that's not what his parents told him to be. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2420.76s)]
*  I don't know not one Indian guy that doesn't do what his parents told him to do. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2428.76s)]
*  He fucked up. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2433.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2434.76s)]
*  You think my parents told me to do this? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2436.76s)]
*  I tried. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2438.76s)]
*  I tried. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2439.76s)]
*  You tried. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2440.76s)]
*  I tried as hard as I could. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2441.76s)]
*  You gave it a try. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2442.76s)]
*  His mom thinks he's in the circus. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2443.76s)]
*  You know, and that's the thing that we lose honor within this society. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2448.76s)]
*  I want you to go out and just be a good functioning human being. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2455.76s)]
*  No, fuck that. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2459.76s)]
*  I want a drill. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2460.76s)]
*  What? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2461.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2462.76s)]
*  And you start to take on America's theme of the bad guy. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2463.76s)]
*  Everybody want to be the bad guy. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2469.76s)]
*  Get money at any cost. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2471.76s)]
*  Good guys finish last. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2472.76s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2474.76s)]
*  No, they really don't. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2475.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2476.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2481.76s)]
*  And it's a, my favorite line of all of the specials is, it seems like I'm the only one locked up for what I did. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2482.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2492.76s)]
*  Because everybody else was, I was in this, they framed me. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2493.76s)]
*  I'm like, they framed you. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2497.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2499.76s)]
*  You just finished robbing somebody two sales over. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2500.76s)]
*  I think they got you pretty fucking big down. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2503.76s)]
*  You still here robbing? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2506.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2509.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2510.76s)]
*  You know, that was, it's embarrassing. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2511.76s)]
*  I had, we were doing a pod, but Charlene and I had a guy in the pod and it's just really great stories and hilarious. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2513.76s)]
*  But he ended up getting locked up for, I think it was like 10 years and for something he didn't do. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2519.76s)]
*  And I asked him and I was like, can I just ask you, did you do other shit that you should have got locked up for? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2523.76s)]
*  And he goes, I should be in here for 200 years. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2530.76s)]
*  So it's like, maybe they didn't get you for the one. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2532.76s)]
*  But they were so- [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2536.76s)]
*  Like Al Capone. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2537.76s)]
*  Exactly. Capone like evaded taxes or whatever. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2538.76s)]
*  But that motherfucker deserved to be locked up with robbery or whatever. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2540.76s)]
*  And then what he died, a syphilis. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2543.76s)]
*  Syphilis. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2545.76s)]
*  It's like, hey, it's like, hey, can't get you on this, but then of course you got to get it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2546.76s)]
*  It takes that syphilis to go off. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2555.76s)]
*  It's a thing even in comedy. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2557.76s)]
*  You have this thing where people feel like you owe me something in comedy. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2562.76s)]
*  I'm supposed to, or you have this entitlement. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2571.76s)]
*  And I'm like, nah, it really doesn't work like that. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2575.76s)]
*  So I'm, a lot of times comics, especially young comics used to be mad at me, especially when I was in the club. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2579.76s)]
*  I would come in, I'm headlining and I'm putting all of your stuff out of the green room. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2585.76s)]
*  Because this is an earned space. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2593.76s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2595.76s)]
*  I didn't come with you. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2596.76s)]
*  If you didn't come with me, then this is not your space. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2598.76s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2603.76s)]
*  You have to earn this space. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2604.76s)]
*  It's like I had to earn it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2605.76s)]
*  Damon Waynes was at my home club at the improv, Houston. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2608.76s)]
*  Great club, by the way. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2613.76s)]
*  And he asked for me to come. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2614.76s)]
*  Oh, they asked for me to come. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2619.76s)]
*  He didn't know who I was. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2620.76s)]
*  They asked for me to come. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2621.76s)]
*  And I get there Saturday, no, Friday. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2622.76s)]
*  I do Friday, Saturday, Sunday. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2627.76s)]
*  Somebody had, he had replaced his feature for Thursday. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2628.76s)]
*  He didn't like them. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2632.76s)]
*  And I had just came into town. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2633.76s)]
*  They asked me to come. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2635.76s)]
*  So I came up there. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2636.76s)]
*  I never went in the green room. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2638.76s)]
*  Out of respect for him. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2640.76s)]
*  Then Sunday, he had his son-in-law. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2641.76s)]
*  Hey, man, can you get out of here for me? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2645.76s)]
*  I came in the green room. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2647.76s)]
*  He said, I understand this is your home club. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2649.76s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2652.76s)]
*  Why didn't you come in this green room? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2653.76s)]
*  I said, I wasn't invited. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2656.76s)]
*  And he said, you old school. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2659.76s)]
*  I'm like, very much so. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2661.76s)]
*  Because now, say you got all your stuff in the green room. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2664.76s)]
*  Dick Gregory takes a nap between the shows. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2667.76s)]
*  So you going in and out of the door while he's in. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2671.76s)]
*  If you come with, if I came with you, then yes, I'm in there. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2674.76s)]
*  You know the expectation. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2678.76s)]
*  But if I did not come with you, I'm not going in the green room. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2679.76s)]
*  I don't know what you got going on in there. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2683.76s)]
*  It's not my space yet. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2684.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2686.76s)]
*  You have to earn the space. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2687.76s)]
*  And the feature wants to, the opener wants to, hey, man, no. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2690.76s)]
*  Because I didn't come up like that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2697.76s)]
*  I came up under, this is the space for the headline. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2699.76s)]
*  Get himself together. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2703.76s)]
*  Featured and host, y'all find somewhere in the club to be. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2704.76s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2708.76s)]
*  And they never understood it. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2711.76s)]
*  But then you get to the space where it's yours. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2713.76s)]
*  And then you understand. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2716.76s)]
*  Like, Hey man, I'm in here. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2718.76s)]
*  I'm in here trying to get my mind together. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2720.76s)]
*  You in here talking about some other shit. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2722.76s)]
*  God knows what. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2725.76s)]
*  You in here arguing with your wife while I'm fucking trying to get my mind together. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2726.76s)]
*  I'm like, get your ass out of here. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2730.76s)]
*  That's not, I don't want that type of energy. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2733.76s)]
*  And especially if I don't know you. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2736.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2738.76s)]
*  It's like going on the road. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2739.76s)]
*  Like this new thing that people do. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2740.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2742.76s)]
*  You probably get this. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2743.76s)]
*  You'll go in on Instagram or somebody that messaged you. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2745.76s)]
*  Hey, are you coming to Seattle? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2748.76s)]
*  I would like to be your opener. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2750.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2752.76s)]
*  I don't know you. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2753.76s)]
*  This is not about you being funny. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2755.76s)]
*  And I don't know you. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2757.76s)]
*  And being in this space is an intimate space. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2758.76s)]
*  You want your friends around you. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2763.76s)]
*  I'm not some strange person. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2766.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2769.76s)]
*  That you have no idea who they are. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2770.76s)]
*  So then you put them on the show and then you listening. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2773.76s)]
*  Yeah, I fucked the elephant last night. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2776.76s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2778.76s)]
*  My audience don't agree with this. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2780.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2782.76s)]
*  There's a version of it where it's also you're curating like a night for those people in the audience. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2783.76s)]
*  And you're putting in a variable that you really don't know what could happen. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2789.76s)]
*  And I think a lot of us come up where like, I just want the opportunity to open for somebody. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2794.76s)]
*  And you think that maybe by opening for them, maybe they'll take you on the road. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2798.76s)]
*  And that does happen. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2801.76s)]
*  It is awesome. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2802.76s)]
*  But the best way I think it's ever been done is like comics will ask to open and they'll just send a joke. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2803.76s)]
*  And if I watch a joke and I think the guy's like hilarious, I'll be like, oh, shit, this is awesome. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2810.76s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be great to have like a local guy on. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2814.76s)]
*  But the entitlement of just, yeah, let me do 15 minutes in front. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2816.76s)]
*  It's like, do you not think that I don't have like some friends I've been doing comedy with this whole time that I would love to give that opportunity? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2819.76s)]
*  But we have an hour and a half to do this show. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2826.76s)]
*  I think a lot of times maybe when you're young in comedy, and I'm sure I'm guilty of this, it's like you don't think about like what the headliner is creating as a night for the audience. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2829.76s)]
*  And it's important to not interrupt that. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2838.76s)]
*  The best way for me is to use someone who knows me. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2840.76s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2847.76s)]
*  That knows you. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2848.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2849.76s)]
*  I got on the first time I ever opened for DL Malik S called me. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2851.76s)]
*  And then DL like, yo, I want him to do the show like qualified. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2861.76s)]
*  If I send somebody to DL, hey, DL, you in Cincinnati. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2868.76s)]
*  If you can allow this person. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2872.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2876.76s)]
*  It's coming from me. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2877.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2878.76s)]
*  And then when this thing happens, it's on it's on me. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2879.76s)]
*  You don't have any type of buffer. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2882.76s)]
*  You know, it's it's funny. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2885.76s)]
*  The guy who sent me a clip asked me to wreck him for someone else who is in town. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2887.76s)]
*  And it does make it so much easier in that way when your friend who you believe in their comedy goes, you know, this kid is nice. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2892.76s)]
*  He's funny and he's familiar with their stuff. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2899.76s)]
*  He's not going to fucking elephant on the stage or whatever. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2901.76s)]
*  I don't think that like people realize I don't want to call it our anxiety. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2903.76s)]
*  But like when you when you create something and I like calling it art because I think it art when you create it with those expectations, you don't want to disrupt that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2907.76s)]
*  Don't want to disrupt it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2916.76s)]
*  It's like you have to get validation and you have to get passed. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2918.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2922.76s)]
*  You know, from somebody else to somebody else, everything in my career, I've got passed. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2923.76s)]
*  I got on our show because of Eric Abrams. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2928.76s)]
*  Oh, Abrams suggested you. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2930.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2932.76s)]
*  And that's the that's where it came from. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2933.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2935.76s)]
*  And Eric Abrams has directed every special I've done. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2936.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2942.76s)]
*  It's just Eric and Jordan. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2943.76s)]
*  Jordan is great. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2945.76s)]
*  Me, Eric, Jordan, Joe, Matt. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2946.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2949.76s)]
*  We just just the four. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2950.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2952.76s)]
*  Four wise men and me is like and we just rolling. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2953.76s)]
*  And if somebody else before they bring somebody else on, it's always a conversation. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2957.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2963.76s)]
*  You know, it's not, oh, this is this is such and such. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2964.76s)]
*  It's just a weird thing. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2967.76s)]
*  And I think that now younger comics have gotten entitled where we owe them something. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2968.76s)]
*  But what bones do you know that I that I made? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2974.76s)]
*  Like, how what do you know about my career? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2977.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2980.76s)]
*  Other than, oh, you see, especially know I've been doing stand up for 27 years. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2981.76s)]
*  I think what some might know is that you're going to have sold out shows that weekend [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2985.76s)]
*  and they can't wait to get in front of sold out crowds. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2990.76s)]
*  So you want to skip the club and come to the theater. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2993.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2997.76s)]
*  And the theater is a different monster. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2999.76s)]
*  This is something that I think is important. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3003.76s)]
*  I think a lot of comics learn is silences in theaters are very different than silences [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3005.76s)]
*  in a small club. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3012.76s)]
*  You've got to be very comfortable owning those moments. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3013.76s)]
*  And that's a skill you learn. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3016.76s)]
*  Like theaters expose jokes that aren't ready yet. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3018.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3022.76s)]
*  Jokes and people. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3023.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3025.76s)]
*  It's a thing. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3026.76s)]
*  And a hundred people being quiet. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3029.76s)]
*  It's different than two thousand. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3034.76s)]
*  It's a different monster. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3038.76s)]
*  You're right. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3040.76s)]
*  And then you have to even when you first when you first start doing theaters, did you [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3041.76s)]
*  realize how tired you were after the show versus when you were doing clubs? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3046.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a different I think it's because you put so much hours like I you know, my [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3050.76s)]
*  journey was I was doing clubs kind of pretty early and I did like three or four rounds [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3056.76s)]
*  before I ever even got a door deal. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3062.76s)]
*  Like I did maybe two rounds of clubs where I was selling them out and I got those bullshit [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3064.76s)]
*  bonuses they give you where you sell out the whole weekend. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3069.76s)]
*  They're like, well, here's five hundred dollars. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3072.76s)]
*  So far extra hundred dollars. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3073.76s)]
*  And I was like, I'm rich. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3075.76s)]
*  The club made a hundred grand on me that week. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3077.76s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3080.76s)]
*  But I think I did that a few times. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3083.76s)]
*  So, yeah, you start to understand the pacing of that of that size room. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3085.76s)]
*  And then when you first make that jump into the theater, I definitely remember it's like, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3089.76s)]
*  oh, that joke wasn't ready yet. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3094.76s)]
*  I could sell it in the club. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3096.76s)]
*  But the theater, the joke wasn't developed enough for the theater. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3098.76s)]
*  I couldn't hold the tension enough in that joke. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3102.76s)]
*  That punch line wasn't strong enough to make them erupt. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3104.76s)]
*  And it is it is like a luxury, a privilege to do those big rooms. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3107.76s)]
*  But I will say like it will sharpen your comedy in a very special way. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3112.76s)]
*  I'm not even talking about the material. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3116.76s)]
*  I'm talking about your body. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3118.76s)]
*  Because in a comedy club, there was you 20 steps this way, 20 steps that way. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3120.76s)]
*  You can engage them. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3125.76s)]
*  You're right. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3126.76s)]
*  You're not really putting you put maybe an extra hundred steps in your life. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3127.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3134.76s)]
*  A theater. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3135.76s)]
*  I can't sit right here. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3136.76s)]
*  I got to go over there. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3138.76s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3140.76s)]
*  So I done done three miles on this stage. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3141.76s)]
*  Bang for three miles. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3146.76s)]
*  You know, you know, something that like I think it helped me for theaters is like when I would do clubs in the city. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3148.76s)]
*  And I've noticed you've done this as well. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3155.76s)]
*  You do it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3157.76s)]
*  But like I would sit down and I would try to use like as little energy as possible. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3158.76s)]
*  And it was it was really like testing if the jokes were strong enough to carry it on its own. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3163.76s)]
*  I was like, I know I can perform these things. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3169.76s)]
*  But like, what if I just kind of clip my wings and see if the joke can carry it? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3171.76s)]
*  Probably. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3176.76s)]
*  Because you can we can all like dance up a joke in a small room. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3178.76s)]
*  But like if you can take almost everything away from it and just focus on that connection. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3182.76s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of your stuff and I know you talk about walking around, but you'll be seated and you'll let them come to you. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3187.76s)]
*  And I think it's like developing that ability to hold attention while not doing anything is crucial for going into these bigger venues. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3193.76s)]
*  Because even taking a few steps to somebody that's on the top, top balcony, that just looks like sitting down to them. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3203.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3209.76s)]
*  So I did the beacon. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3211.76s)]
*  And I knew that I didn't want a whole store feature. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3213.76s)]
*  I just wanted to do it myself. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3218.76s)]
*  It was a thing. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3220.76s)]
*  The old last year you came. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3222.76s)]
*  Somebody opened up the Iran Davis, you know, of course. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3224.76s)]
*  Yeah, I love my came out. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3227.76s)]
*  Came out. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3228.76s)]
*  But in my mind, this time it's just me and the people. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3229.76s)]
*  Peter Parker, great DJ. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3234.76s)]
*  He did his thing. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3236.76s)]
*  And then when the lights went out, I heard just eruptions like they knew I was. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3238.76s)]
*  And I felt like when I was at the DMX concert, I just started screaming for no reason. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3247.76s)]
*  I knew he was coming. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3251.76s)]
*  I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3253.76s)]
*  I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3259.76s)]
*  Oh, d-x. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3263.76s)]
*  So when I walked out, they didn't. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3265.76s)]
*  They realized didn't know that I was coming out first. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3271.76s)]
*  Oh, so it was a real surprise for them. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3274.76s)]
*  They're expecting an opener. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3275.76s)]
*  Yeah. And then I watched the whole place erupt. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3277.76s)]
*  Oh, no, that's him. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3281.76s)]
*  Yeah. And this lady DM me and said, it's crazy because I've never done this before. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3283.76s)]
*  You walked out and I was so excited. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3291.76s)]
*  I just start crying. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3295.76s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm a Michael Jackson. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3297.76s)]
*  And it was like a great compliment that she was so excited. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3303.76s)]
*  And I've been that excited to see probably one person. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3307.76s)]
*  Who? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3313.76s)]
*  X. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3314.76s)]
*  It was like, DM, man, DM, it was crazy. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3315.76s)]
*  And he had a movie premiere in Houston and he was sitting right in front of me. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3319.76s)]
*  And my boy was like, you losing it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3326.76s)]
*  I'm like, fucking right. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3328.76s)]
*  So he shot a video. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3330.76s)]
*  He shot his video in Galveston. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3335.76s)]
*  Which song? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3337.76s)]
*  I forget the song that he shot in Galveston, but they can probably find it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3338.76s)]
*  But his crew was at this club called Cloud Nine. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3343.76s)]
*  And this is back when I was drinking Hennessy like crazy. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3349.76s)]
*  I was a crazy person. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3354.76s)]
*  So I get thrown out the club because I was standing on their furniture. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3355.76s)]
*  And I wouldn't stop. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3360.76s)]
*  So I'm out of the club. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3361.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3362.76s)]
*  And this dude named Wham from Chicago, Wham come out and Wham was like a big time gangster. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3363.76s)]
*  He was the only person I ever seen being able to carry a shotgun in the club. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3373.76s)]
*  Like I don't even think he had no license or nothing. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3376.76s)]
*  So he comes out, who was standing on my goddamn furniture? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3380.76s)]
*  And I was like, I'm so drunk. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3383.76s)]
*  I'm like, I was standing on your furniture. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3385.76s)]
*  And he's like, Ali, you need to cut this shit out. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3386.76s)]
*  So some other dudes named Fats and they from Queens, they start laughing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3389.76s)]
*  I'm like, fuck y'all laughing about. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3395.76s)]
*  And when they threw me out, it's like the parking lot is gravel. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3397.76s)]
*  So I kind of slid and the rough riders was on this bus. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3402.76s)]
*  And I was like, yo, y'all can get it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3408.76s)]
*  And everybody on that fucking bus can get it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3411.76s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3414.76s)]
*  So they get on the bus and they walking towards me and Wham got a shotgun saying, now y'all ain't gonna fuck with him. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3415.76s)]
*  He was saying, Ali, go back in the club. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3421.76s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no Wham. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3423.76s)]
*  What they talking about? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3425.76s)]

*  I went back in the club and about, I'm gonna give you 10 minutes. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3430.76s)]
*  I'm right back on that goddamn furniture. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3438.76s)]
*  Menace girl named Sanobia was dancing on the furniture. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3441.76s)]
*  And he was like, yo, Ali is fucking terribly drunk right now. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3444.76s)]
*  Rough riders in the club at this point? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3451.76s)]
*  No, they still outside. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3453.76s)]
*  And Capone brings me here. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3455.76s)]
*  I'm doing BBQs and it's a little box. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3461.76s)]
*  And I'm like, Capone, I need a stool. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3465.76s)]
*  He said, nothing can fit up here. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3469.76s)]
*  I'm like, no, I need a chair. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3470.76s)]
*  And the microphone comes down and then I'm doing my thing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3472.76s)]
*  And the rough riders are upstairs. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3476.76s)]
*  Are in the back. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3478.76s)]
*  They like in the back. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3479.76s)]
*  And I turned. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3480.76s)]
*  I did not get into a child and you said, I don't even start that shit. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3481.76s)]
*  Shit. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3487.76s)]
*  Like Capone like, you're a fucking crazy man. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3492.76s)]
*  I said, I'm gonna do it. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3495.76s)]
*  And I remember saying this to them. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3496.76s)]
*  I said, you know something, y'all ain't gonna do nothing to me because I go out there and push them bikes over. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3499.76s)]
*  Y'all gonna cry. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3504.76s)]
*  Cry. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3505.76s)]
*  That's the real Domino thing. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3508.76s)]
*  And we had a good time. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3514.76s)]
*  They knew I was fucked up. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3515.76s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet X? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3517.76s)]
*  Just at the booth. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3520.76s)]
*  Just at that moment. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3521.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3522.76s)]
*  That was before all this happened though, right? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3523.76s)]
*  He didn't remember you from trying to find his entire crew. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3525.76s)]
*  He wasn't there. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3528.76s)]
*  He was out. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3529.76s)]
*  They was already setting up in Galveston. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3530.76s)]
*  They was headed to Galveston, but they stopped the party. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3532.76s)]
*  But I remember being that excited to see it because it's like I can relate to everything that he was saying. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3535.76s)]
*  That he was saying. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3542.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3543.76s)]
*  You know, it's not like a lot of new rappers. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3544.76s)]
*  I don't relate to none of this shit they be saying. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3545.76s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3547.76s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3548.76s)]
*  Like I'm like, that's what y'all doing? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3549.76s)]
*  This shit sounds stupid. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3550.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3551.76s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3552.76s)]
*  There's some copy here. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3553.76s)]
*  Let me just tell you what I want to say. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3554.76s)]
*  They turn supplements into gummy bears and it's absolutely fantastic. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3557.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3560.76s)]
*  I walk into the office. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3561.76s)]
*  I grab a pack of these gummy bears. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3562.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter what's in them. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3564.76s)]
*  Antioxidants, antides, antida. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3565.76s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3567.76s)]
*  It could be anti-semitism. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3568.76s)]
*  The point is the second I get these gummies, I pick them up, I tear it, and I eat it, and they're delicious. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3569.76s)]
*  And then afterwards I get to feel good about it. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3575.76s)]
*  I don't get to feel like I ate gummy bears. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3577.76s)]
*  I get to feel like I got my daily supplements. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3579.76s)]
*  This is genius. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3581.76s)]
*  Groons. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3582.76s)]
*  Am I pronouncing it right? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3584.76s)]
*  Groons. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3585.76s)]
*  Because I saw the little oom lot, so I assumed it was Groons. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3586.76s)]
*  Everyone in the studio is eating these every single day, probably too many packs a day. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3589.76s)]
*  I would like to show you what they look like. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3593.76s)]
*  We ate them all. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3595.76s)]
*  Because it is a fantastic snack and it's actually good for you. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3596.76s)]
*  It's low in sugar, gut healthy, and has immunity and cognition benefits. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3599.76s)]
*  You want a supplement that you can enjoy. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3604.76s)]
*  This isn't a chore. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3606.76s)]
*  It's not something disgusting that you're just eating so you can live forever. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3607.76s)]
*  This is the thing that you want to eat nonstop. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3611.76s)]
*  I would eat it for four meals a day if I could. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3614.76s)]
*  The point is you got to go to www.gruns.co and you're getting up to 52% off. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3616.76s)]
*  Use the code FLAGRAN. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3624.76s)]
*  Go do it right now. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3625.76s)]
*  They're absolutely delicious. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3626.76s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3627.76s)]
*  All right, guys. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3628.76s)]
*  Let's take a break real quick. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3629.76s)]
*  I'm literally going to eat this right now because we have to record for three more hours. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3630.76s)]
*  And I'm not going to have time for food. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3633.76s)]
*  And this is the healthiest, best protein bar on the market. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3634.76s)]
*  It's a protein bar with a simple concept. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3638.76s)]
*  It's the most protein with the fewest calories. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3640.76s)]
*  28 grams of protein, 150 calories. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3642.76s)]
*  You know how insane that is for a protein bar? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3645.76s)]
*  Most of the time if it's got 28 grams of protein, it's like 300, 400 calories. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3647.76s)]
*  They cut that shit in half. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3650.76s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3652.76s)]
*  Stop fucking around. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3653.76s)]
*  Buy these. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3654.76s)]
*  Adequate protein intake is critical for building and preserving muscle now and as we age. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3655.76s)]
*  It also plays a vital role in metabolic health, preventing excess body fat accumulation. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3660.76s)]
*  Listen, I'm trying to get less fat. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3666.76s)]
*  I'm eating one of these every day. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3668.76s)]
*  I think it's working so far. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3670.76s)]
*  So that's all you need to know. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3671.76s)]
*  Look at me. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3673.76s)]
*  Do I look good? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3674.76s)]
*  No. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3675.76s)]
*  Do I look less shitty? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3676.76s)]

*  We need to let you as calm as possible. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3744.76s)]
*  I was doing another podcast. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3748.76s)]
*  Whose podcast? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3751.76s)]

*  I was doing a podcast. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3754.76s)]
*  I was doing another podcast. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3756.76s)]
*  Whose podcast? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3758.76s)]
*  Waving a Red Flag. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3760.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3762.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3763.76s)]
*  And I almost didn't come over here. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3764.76s)]
*  No way. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3766.76s)]
*  What happened? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3767.76s)]
*  I was in the car with my manager. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3768.76s)]
*  I'm like, yo, he got something against black women. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3770.76s)]
*  I'm not fucking with you. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3773.76s)]
*  I'm not fucking with you. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3775.76s)]
*  Don't believe the internet. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3778.76s)]
*  Ali, come on. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3780.76s)]
*  So no, this is, this is what I did. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3781.76s)]
*  I went on Pivot and watched the whole interview. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3784.76s)]
*  Like I was doing interviews, watching it. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3788.76s)]
*  They were like, you got to come out. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3791.76s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want to miss it. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3793.76s)]
*  I can't pause and shit, right? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3795.76s)]
*  So as I constantly listened, it made sense. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3797.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3804.76s)]
*  You know, and I was like, my first, and then you said your knee jerk reaction was to go with, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3805.76s)]
*  and my knee jerk reaction, I'm not fucking with you. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3811.76s)]
*  And it made more sense because that's what happens with us a lot. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3814.76s)]
*  It's people that don't fuck with me, period. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3820.76s)]
*  And they probably don't even know you. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3822.76s)]
*  It's a headline or one line that you said. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3824.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is, and this is like, I think we're all guilty of this shit. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3826.76s)]
*  And that's why I kind of have empathy when people are saying these certain things. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3829.76s)]
*  It's like the version of me that you think I am, I probably would feel the same way as you. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3832.76s)]
*  That's just not who I am. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3838.76s)]
*  Yeah. It's like people got mad at me because I said something about Tupac. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3840.76s)]
*  Well, he was a fucking dancer when I met him. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3845.76s)]
*  You mad at me for the truth? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3849.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3851.76s)]
*  He was dancing. I'm like, this is public record. This is public knowledge. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3852.76s)]
*  What did you say about him being a dancer? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3857.76s)]
*  I just said when I met Tupac, I'm already in the streets. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3860.76s)]
*  So when I meet him, he's with Digital Underground. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3865.76s)]
*  I meet him with Digital Underground. Where'd he be? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3870.76s)]
*  I'm sitting there, he's in an elevator. He's there in Houston for a music conference. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3872.76s)]
*  I meet him then. It wasn't the Thug Life Tupac at the time. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3877.76s)]
*  But why would it be when I'm already in the streets? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3882.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have looked at him like that. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3886.76s)]
*  So then when I go to prison, then I hear all the rest of this shit. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3888.76s)]
*  And I was like, oh, okay. But I didn't see it. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3892.76s)]
*  I never saw him in concert. I never saw Biggie in concert. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3897.76s)]
*  My shit started at 14. They wasn't in the streets like that when I was coming up. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3901.76s)]
*  Why did this make people so mad? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3911.76s)]
*  Because they got some love affair with a person that they don't know. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3913.76s)]
*  It's people that was in my DM that probably wouldn't defend their mom like this. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3918.76s)]
*  You want to honor your family, but you want to honor the legacy of Tupac when you want to honor your family. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3926.76s)]
*  I don't think there's one person on this planet that I actually don't know that I would defend. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3936.76s)]
*  That vehemently. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3944.76s)]
*  That I'm going to take my time out to say a threatening message to you, incriminate myself on the Internet. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3946.76s)]
*  I was like, okay. And then in my mind, I'm like, people don't understand. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3958.76s)]
*  I would never say that I was the toughest dude. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3966.76s)]
*  I'm just willing to defend myself with everything that I have in my family. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3968.76s)]
*  You don't have to be tough for that. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3974.76s)]
*  I think some people call that toughness, for sure. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3976.76s)]
*  The level that I'm going to go through to defend myself is crazy down. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3980.76s)]
*  You can't even imagine the type of shit I do to defend myself. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3988.76s)]
*  But now you're at a level where... [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3995.76s)]
*  People say that shit all the time. I don't give a shit about it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3998.76s)]
*  Every year I can get... [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4005.76s)]
*  You got so much to lose. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4007.76s)]
*  No, no. Not that. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4008.76s)]
*  Because this is something I deal with specifically with the situation you just brought up, where it's just like... [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4010.76s)]
*  You get to a level where people know you so casually. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4016.76s)]
*  Earlier in your career, they probably know you intimately. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4020.76s)]
*  Your super fans have seen probably 10 hours of your comedy. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4023.76s)]
*  They know everything that you... [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4026.76s)]
*  They know if you say this about Tupac, they're like, yeah, because he met him when he was a dancer. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4028.76s)]
*  They know everything about you. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4031.76s)]
*  People that listen to the podcast religiously, they know everything about us. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4033.76s)]
*  So when they hear some stupid rumor on the internet, it was like, yeah, that's not Schultz at all. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4036.76s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4041.76s)]
*  But the people that know you casually, the bigger you get, the more people know you casually. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4042.76s)]
*  And will start having opinions about you based on that casual nature that will be wrong. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4048.76s)]
*  That's where I start to go. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4053.76s)]
*  If you fight every single wrong opinion about you as you reach superstardom, you'll never stop fighting. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4054.76s)]
*  Never stop fighting. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4060.76s)]
*  So there has to be a certain point where it's just like, I know you're willing to die for it, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4061.76s)]
*  but for the person that doesn't even know you, does that make sense? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4065.76s)]
*  Okay, I'll go with that. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4071.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4073.76s)]
*  I'm with you when you're ready. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4074.76s)]
*  I feel like a part of you is like, still, if they call me out my name, I'm still going to fight. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4078.76s)]
*  You don't need them wherever. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4084.76s)]
*  They got to know there's a cost. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4088.76s)]
*  But you can't be paying that debt every single time because that is the nature of success. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4091.76s)]
*  I mean, we have this conversation all the time where it's just like, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4096.76s)]
*  the cost of success is the lack of understanding of who you truly are. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4099.76s)]
*  There are people that think, who's the guy that plays Iron Man? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4105.76s)]
*  Robert Downey Jr. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4108.76s)]
*  There are people that think Robert Downey Jr. is actually Iron Man. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4109.76s)]
*  They don't think he's some guy. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4112.76s)]
*  I actually love Robert Downey Jr. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4114.76s)]
*  Yeah, because he's Iron Man to you. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4116.76s)]
*  And it took me a long time to get back to him. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4118.76s)]
*  And I've always liked his shit. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4124.76s)]
*  But then he did Less Than Zero. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4126.76s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4128.76s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4131.76s)]
*  What happened in Less Than Zero? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4132.76s)]
*  It's some scene where he had semen on his mouth. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4134.76s)]
*  I was like, I knew it was some gay shit. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4138.76s)]
*  I knew it was some gay shit. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4143.76s)]
*  I was like, yo, it took me a while to get back. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4145.76s)]
*  I watched all the Iron Man's. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4150.76s)]
*  It wasn't until he died in the desert that you were like, I forgive him. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4153.76s)]
*  I was like, oh, come on with this bullshit, man. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4159.76s)]
*  This is the funniest thing, too. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4162.76s)]
*  When he first gets locked up, he gets put on a block that is known as, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4166.76s)]
*  they call it the sissy block. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4170.76s)]

*  I should have just said, this is why you got to be direct. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4200.76s)]
*  Yes or no? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4204.76s)]
*  Me, my cavalier asked him, we'll see. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4206.76s)]

*  What's Cadillac? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4302.76s)]
*  That's what it's called. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4303.76s)]
*  It's laid back. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4304.76s)]
*  OK, no fighting, no nothing. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4305.76s)]
*  He could have done the easiest time ever. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4307.76s)]
*  I think listening to guys suck each other off is pretty difficult. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4310.76s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4314.76s)]
*  It's prison. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4316.76s)]
*  So I asked. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4319.76s)]
*  That's tough to hear you in the same place. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4322.76s)]
*  I would have been like, yo, shut up. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4324.76s)]
*  I'm like, hey, man, y'all think y'all can move me? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4326.76s)]
*  And the CO told me, no, Sissy. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4329.76s)]
*  I'm like, man, not me. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4331.76s)]
*  I'm just open-ended. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4335.76s)]
*  Hey, bro, I just need to be moved. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4336.76s)]
*  And old school, so there ain't nothing but a couple ways to get moved. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4338.76s)]
*  Either they move you. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4341.76s)]
*  Or you got to start beating people up. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4343.76s)]
*  And I asked them one more time to move me. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4346.76s)]
*  And they was like, no. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4351.76s)]
*  And then this shit went bad. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4353.76s)]
*  And old school was like, oh, come on, Yos, you're fucking the Cadillac up. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4355.76s)]
*  And I'm in there hitting people and they got shit to do with nothing. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4360.76s)]
*  So they take me out. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4365.76s)]
*  They put me in solitary for two days. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4367.76s)]
*  And the warden comes. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4369.76s)]
*  He said, I'm going to put your ass on the worst block over here. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4372.76s)]
*  And it was M Block. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4376.76s)]
*  I get to M Block. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4378.76s)]
*  And this is like home. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4380.76s)]
*  Like they in there gambling. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4382.76s)]
*  It's all type of foul prison shit going on over there. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4384.76s)]
*  And I'm sitting there like this. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4388.76s)]
*  Sleeping peacefully. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4389.76s)]
*  This shit is like I'm in the Cadillac. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4390.76s)]
*  I'm in the back of the Cadillac. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4396.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm good. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4398.76s)]
*  I just I didn't want to be associated. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4399.76s)]
*  That's a hard time to do. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4402.76s)]
*  Because then if because if you're there, people start thinking that you're there for a reason. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4403.76s)]
*  And then you could be a victim, right? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4407.76s)]
*  Like you probably could be that they would have found out. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4409.76s)]
*  Oh, no, they just misplaced him. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4412.76s)]
*  It was a bad situation. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4415.76s)]
*  So once I got to M Block, you were good. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4418.76s)]
*  It was it was straight. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4420.76s)]
*  And you knew enough people at M Block where I didn't know anybody on M Block. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4422.76s)]
*  Did anybody not try you on some gay shit? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4425.76s)]
*  But anybody like test your like they heard why I got moved over. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4427.76s)]
*  So they were like, are we respected? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4431.76s)]
*  Oh, that motherfucker was not staying on that block. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4432.76s)]
*  And apparently other people had gone through that when you were beating up the guys on the sissy block. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4436.76s)]
*  Did any of them enjoy it? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4442.76s)]
*  Were they like, I mean, so mad. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4443.76s)]
*  Stop doing what you start doing. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4453.76s)]
*  Don't enjoy it. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4455.76s)]
*  Harder. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4457.76s)]

*  Start punching yourself. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4462.76s)]
*  I never even thought I'd be so fucking mad. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4467.76s)]
*  That's all it takes. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4470.76s)]
*  I'm doing like, yes. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4471.76s)]
*  I'm going to keep that in mind if I ever go to prison. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4475.76s)]
*  If someone tries to fight me, I'm going to call him daddy immediately. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4477.76s)]
*  I'll be good. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4480.76s)]

*  So bad. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4505.76s)]
*  How crazy is it that the CEOs made you do some shit, made you do some fucked up shit just so you could get to a place where you wouldn't do fucked up shit? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4507.76s)]

*  Basically none until you got to kind of get known. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4523.76s)]
*  Does known mean like you curry favor with the CEOs or does known mean? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4529.76s)]

*  Let me tell you where it started. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4591.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4592.76s)]
*  Because the funniest thing. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4593.76s)]
*  When I got to Torres, they was in a crazy game situation. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4594.76s)]
*  It was a lot of riots. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4599.76s)]
*  I came from another unit with, I was considered an old head when I got to. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4601.76s)]
*  You're 20 years old. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4607.76s)]
*  I was 21 and I'm like, I'm considered an old kid. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4608.76s)]
*  Okay, OG. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4614.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4615.76s)]
*  I'm coming from a unit of old school cats. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4616.76s)]
*  Right, got it. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4620.76s)]
*  So when they send us there, they sent us there to get the unit under control. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4621.76s)]
*  Oh, there was too many young dudes who were causing problems. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4627.76s)]
*  They didn't know how to do time. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4630.76s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4632.76s)]
*  So they strategically will send some OGs there to get the young guys to kind of stay in line. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4633.76s)]
*  Hey, man, because let me tell you about old heads in prison. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4639.76s)]
*  That's kind of smart. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4643.76s)]
*  It's like understanding that the prisoners do run the prison to a certain extent. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4644.76s)]
*  So you can't just bully them into submission. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4650.76s)]
*  You have to kind of work with them. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4653.76s)]
*  You need a boss to go over. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4655.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4656.76s)]

*  Yeah, with the honest Haslem. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4659.76s)]
*  It's like he don't even have to play, but he's going to keep everybody in line. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4661.76s)]
*  Hey, man, you can't, you don't want to do your time like that. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4664.76s)]
*  You explain to people, man, you don't want to do your time like this. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4667.76s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4670.76s)]
*  The young guys are coming in, it's their first bid and they just like, I'm going to act crazy like this. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4671.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4674.76s)]
*  And the OGs need to come in and be like, dude, this is every day. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4675.76s)]
*  Calm the fuck down. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4679.76s)]
*  Let's pass this shit in the best way possible. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4681.76s)]
*  Talking to people. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4683.76s)]
*  So you get tapped. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4685.76s)]
*  How does he know that he can? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4686.76s)]
*  This is kind of the interesting thing. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4688.76s)]
*  Are you already friends with Mendoza? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4689.76s)]
*  Not friends, but do you already have like enough trust built up with him? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4691.76s)]
*  Mendoza noticed that everybody on my block started enrolling in school. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4694.76s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4701.76s)]
*  Okay, so. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4702.76s)]
*  And I would come, I was the person that would, with the young, because you had different age groups and old heads go to different, you can talk to them. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4703.76s)]
*  You can talk to these group people. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4716.76s)]
*  So you had people that was already in the field that started enrolling in school and enrolling in trades because now you have somebody who's saying, so this how you going to do your time? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4718.76s)]
*  What you going to go back outside with? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4728.76s)]
*  To nothing. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4730.76s)]
*  Yeah, go outside there with some sort of education, you're going to have a chance. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4731.76s)]
*  And I look like them. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4733.76s)]
*  I'm the same face. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4736.76s)]
*  It's just like now. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4738.76s)]
*  When I go to, when they ask me to come somewhere, I don't speak to children that's in trouble like I'm not a part of this trouble. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4740.76s)]
*  I don't go in with the, you got to do, I'm like, let me tell you what I was doing. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4752.76s)]

*  Let me show you how the road that you're going to end up. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4760.76s)]
*  If you continue to go down this road. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4768.76s)]
*  You know, let me show you the weakness in you by showing you how weak I was at this time. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4771.76s)]
*  That's why you never hear me glorifying selling drugs. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4778.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4782.76s)]
*  Because it was so crippling to my community. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4783.76s)]
*  I remember being Roy Woods Jr. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4785.76s)]
*  I tell this story, he still doesn't realize how him and Chris Cotton saved the rest of the piece of Chris Cotton. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4788.76s)]
*  Save me. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4796.76s)]
*  We're doing, Comedy Central does a festival in San Francisco. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4798.76s)]
*  And they're doing Ari's show, this is not happening. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4802.76s)]
*  And I'm there to do the show, tell another story, whatever. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4807.76s)]
*  And I'm so depressed because I can't find a road to the theater that wasn't riddled with homeless drug users. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4812.76s)]
*  And I'm so sad because my mind keeps saying, what was the role that you played in this? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4827.76s)]
*  In this. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4837.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4838.76s)]
*  This is probably the Fillmore that you were performing at. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4839.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is the offspring of your actions. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4841.76s)]
*  And it was, man, I would walk 10 blocks down to go down 10 blocks, come around and still with see. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4846.76s)]
*  And I was like, I was really depressed. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4856.76s)]
*  And when Roy asked me what story I was telling, and Chris Cotton was talking about what he was story he was telling. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4861.76s)]
*  And Roy told me the story he was telling about when he got booed at the Apollo. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4869.76s)]
*  And he was staying, he didn't really have no money to stay. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4876.76s)]
*  He was standing next to this prostitute who was doing her business. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4880.76s)]
*  And she had told him all these things she had to sleep with, and he had got booed. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4884.76s)]
*  And then he came, he was sitting on the steps, and she walked up saying, it didn't go well, huh, baby? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4890.76s)]
*  And he was like, nah. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4895.76s)]
*  He said, now you know when I told you about them dicks I was sucking? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4897.76s)]
*  Some of them dicks had bumps on them. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4901.76s)]
*  They were saying, but you got to keep doing what you're going to do. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4904.76s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4907.76s)]
*  Shit. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4908.76s)]
*  It could be worse. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4909.76s)]
*  They said it's going to be a bump in the road. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4911.76s)]
*  And I'm like, I am laughing hysterically. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4915.76s)]
*  And it kind of broke me up. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4922.76s)]
*  I'm like, Roy, that is fucking awesomely funny. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4927.76s)]
*  You always do that. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4931.76s)]
*  You know, I go through these times where I blame myself for this, even this culture, how these kids, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4933.76s)]
*  because I was out there a while. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4946.76s)]
*  And that's, that's, what was my initial thing? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4949.76s)]
*  People was like, well, when you think that you're going to get, you're going to blow up. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4956.76s)]
*  And I would always say, when I pay the universe back for the wrongs I've done. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4960.76s)]
*  And that's a big thing. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4966.76s)]
*  If you believe in energy, you believe in karma, the things that you did that was destructive, you have to, you know, rectify, rectify those things. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4969.76s)]
*  Before you get to another level and be destructive again. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4978.76s)]
*  Like, I don't want to be destructive in my speech. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4983.76s)]
*  I don't want to, I don't not want to be a beacon of light for people. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4987.76s)]
*  That's why I don't mind telling the stories about prison, because some people look at it like, oh shit, I was in that same condition. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4993.76s)]
*  How can I do this? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5001.76s)]
*  And I tell them now, this is not the goal. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5003.76s)]
*  The goal is to have a normal life, functioning life. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5007.76s)]
*  You don't have to be a, because I don't consider myself no superstar. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5012.76s)]
*  I don't consider myself even a celebrity. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5017.76s)]
*  I'm not invited to shit. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5019.76s)]
*  I saw you at the Tom Brady, you were on stage. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5026.76s)]

*  I saw you when you was on stage. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5036.76s)]
*  I was invited by my publicist. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5039.76s)]
*  Because the publicist that was running the thing, I was paying, I was like, damn, they should have gotten me a ticket, all that fucking money I was paying for a month. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5046.76s)]
*  It's crap, man, you'll pay a publicist. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5057.76s)]
*  Five grand, seven grand a month. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5060.76s)]
*  You do nothing. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5062.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5063.76s)]
*  Sometimes, sometimes they are effective. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5064.76s)]
*  I think early in my career, I was like, this is a fucking waste of money. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5066.76s)]
*  But I will say this like last run, I thought they did a really good job of like getting, especially for guys like us who do YouTube and like social media stuff, getting mainstream sources to pay attention to what we got going on. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5069.76s)]
*  It's almost like Hollywood and like mainstream outlets have no clue the views that we're getting. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5082.76s)]
*  Like they're completely uneducated about what's happening on the Internet, which is where all the people actually are. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5088.76s)]
*  There's a huge disconnect, man. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5094.76s)]
*  You talking about, I've been on the Emmy ballot three times. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5096.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5101.76s)]
*  And people with lesser material. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5103.76s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5107.76s)]
*  Don't seek justice in this business. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5108.76s)]
*  I stopped. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5110.76s)]
*  I stopped. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5112.76s)]
*  But the point, I keep plugging in this particular thing, the Emmys and the Grammys, because one of us had to win shows. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5113.76s)]
*  One of the independents have to eventually win. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5123.76s)]
*  And now the floodgates are open. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5127.76s)]
*  If one of us wins anything. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5130.76s)]
*  I went out there for this like Emmys thing, this like introduction thing that basically Netflix pitches the people that they're hoping might be nominated and win. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5134.76s)]
*  And it was one of those things where it's like, I'll be honest, like one of the execs came over like, listen, this isn't exactly like a meritocracy. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5143.76s)]
*  There are certain people that just kind of get nominated every year. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5149.76s)]
*  And I'm not trying to show them. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5152.76s)]
*  I just think that there's like a lack of understanding of like what we're doing. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5153.76s)]
*  And I'm very fortunate that it feels like, especially maybe even with the last special, the mainstream, for better, for worse, there's criticism, but then there's some time celebration. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5158.76s)]
*  At least it's becoming more aware. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5169.76s)]
*  And that's why I've been paying attention to what's happening with you, because at a certain point, the numbers can't be ignored. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5171.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like they just break through on their own. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5179.76s)]
*  And like I witnessed it happen for me, like even being invited to the Tom Brady thing. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5182.76s)]
*  Tom Brady thing was Sunday, just to put things in perspective. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5186.76s)]
*  Friday and Saturday, I did Madison Square Garden. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5189.76s)]
*  So it's like that's where I was in my career. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5192.76s)]
*  And that's kind of always kind of looked at things in order to get that Tom Brady opportunity. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5196.76s)]
*  I need to first sell out Madison Square Garden twice in order to get JFL like new faces. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5200.76s)]
*  Remember that thing? Yeah, I had to have five shows on MTV. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5207.76s)]
*  And I'm looking at other people on new faces like they are new because I don't even know your face. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5211.76s)]
*  So like I've just I've accepted that it might not be a meritocracy, but I'm going to have to work. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5215.76s)]
*  I don't care how many times harder I'm just going to have to work to get it. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5223.76s)]
*  And that's literally why I was very excited for you to come on, because I'm seeing what's happening with you. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5226.76s)]
*  And is it delayed? And is the awareness from like maybe typical industry delayed? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5233.76s)]
*  Yes. But is it imminent? Absolutely. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5239.76s)]
*  Because you cannot deny numbers and appreciation. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5244.76s)]
*  Skill you can deny. I think people deny skill all the time. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5249.76s)]
*  But they cannot deny a wave of interest. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5253.76s)]
*  A community, an audience that really fucks with it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5256.76s)]
*  You cannot deny it. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5258.76s)]
*  And whether you get an Emmy or not, I feel like your audience won't care either what. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5259.76s)]
*  Because they know the real, they see it, they consume it. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5262.76s)]
*  You know, I sometimes you just reminded me of something about mantra like with Montreal. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5266.76s)]
*  I get they call me and say, hey, man, you you you have Montreal. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5271.76s)]
*  They want you to come to Montreal and you're going to do like six theater dates. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5278.76s)]
*  But that theater is a small. You know, I wasn't invited to the gala. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5283.76s)]
*  So and I asked, I said, for what? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5287.76s)]
*  Like, what am I? Why am I going? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5291.76s)]
*  It's like, what? I said, I don't want to go to Montreal. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5294.76s)]
*  And I know this is the super bowl of comedy. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5298.76s)]
*  I said, yeah, what what do you go there for to get management to have a deal on it? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5301.76s)]
*  And at the time I had a deal with Comedy Central. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5310.76s)]
*  I had an agency and I had management. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5314.76s)]
*  I said, did you all quit or something? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5316.76s)]
*  Like, no, but you just go. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5321.76s)]
*  And they had to really convince me to go. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5322.76s)]
*  I'm glad I went. It's an education process, dude. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5325.76s)]
*  It sounds crazy. I know it sounds crazy because because I know the exact position you're in, by the way, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5329.76s)]
*  where it's just like you're doing bigger venues than these people that are getting like nominated for things. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5335.76s)]
*  You have bigger numbers and you're just looking at the raw data going, what the fuck am I missing here? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5341.76s)]
*  But Hollywood is really a bubble. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5346.76s)]
*  Like even any time I've done a movie, the only people that know me on the movie set are the guys that are like, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5349.76s)]
*  they're working the set, like the grips, the lighting, because they're the ones that are watching the real shit, right? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5355.76s)]
*  They're not watching like, what is this avant-garde new like movie that's in French? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5362.76s)]
*  Like, if you say you like it shows you have taste in cinema. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5367.76s)]
*  Like, now the real people will kind of know. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5370.76s)]
*  And eventually that becomes so deniable it trickles through. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5373.76s)]
*  Would you do the Addams Family, would you do Go Man's? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5376.76s)]
*  Because I look like them? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5381.76s)]
*  Yeah, you look like them. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5383.76s)]
*  They'd be a fucking great Go Man. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5385.76s)]
*  They speak Spanish fluently. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5387.76s)]
*  If they're rebooting, maybe I'll check it out. I gotta read the script for sure. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5388.76s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5393.76s)]
*  Listen, we're in the same stuff that we were last week. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5396.76s)]
*  Not like anybody's noticing that, but we would like to bring it up because we're authentic. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5398.76s)]
*  Dude, what a finals, right? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5401.76s)]
*  Listen, we are, we are, I mean, unreal. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5403.76s)]
*  You know what's funny though is like we're recording this right now. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5406.76s)]
*  We have no clue if World War III has begun. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5410.76s)]
*  You know, like, so it is, if it has begun, this is what life used to be like. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5413.76s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it's like a little time capsule. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5418.76s)]
*  It is a time capsule. Yeah, pretty nice. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5421.76s)]
*  Shit, we might be dead right now. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5423.76s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5424.76s)]
*  You don't think they're getting over here? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5426.76s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5428.76s)]
*  I'm just saying. You don't got an iron dome yet. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5430.76s)]
*  I'm on vacation, bro. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5432.76s)]
*  Right now I'm on vacation somewhere. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5434.76s)]
*  So you're closer to the fucking fight. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5436.76s)]
*  Who knows when I'm on vacation? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5438.76s)]
*  Yeah, what are you doing right now? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5439.76s)]
*  I can't tell you. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5441.76s)]
*  I'm not going to give up my location, God forbid. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5443.76s)]
*  God forbid they do some sort of like targeted attack. I'm not going to do it. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5446.76s)]
*  Point that I'm trying to make is that there's a big UFC fight that is this weekend if America still exists. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5450.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5456.76s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5457.76s)]
*  Vegas. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5458.76s)]
*  Las Vegas. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5459.76s)]
*  Even if it doesn't exist, I have a feeling Dana is going to be like, yo, we're doing it. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5460.76s)]
*  He's going to make that fight. He's going to make that fight. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5462.76s)]
*  It's happening. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5464.76s)]
*  100%. It will be in the desert no matter what. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5465.76s)]
*  So, yeah, Toporia versus Olivera. Listen, with all due respect to Olivera, I can't see how Toporia loses this fight. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5469.76s)]
*  Same. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5475.76s)]
*  This Toporia guy is, Olivera gets touched, he gets hit, and he has amazing resilience. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5476.76s)]
*  Like he'll go down and then get back up. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5482.76s)]
*  But I just, I can't see Toporia not connecting and I can't see him. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5484.76s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't have the jiu-jitsu that Olivera does, but he's a great wrestler. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5490.76s)]
*  So I just, I don't see. I think it's going one way. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5494.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know much of what I'm seeing of Toporia. He's nice. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5498.76s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing. The fight before it is Pantoja versus Karr France. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5502.76s)]
*  Kai Karr France. Kai's a stylebender's boy. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5508.76s)]
*  And Pantoja's just an absolute menace. That's going to be an interesting one right there. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5511.76s)]
*  That's going to be an absolute, what is it, a barn burner? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5515.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, a barn burner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5519.76s)]
*  Why is that a saying? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5520.76s)]
*  I don't know, but Charles Barkley always struggles saying, that's a barn burner. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5521.76s)]
*  Why, where does that, why is that, why would we describe that as like a good thing? I don't know. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5525.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I've never seen a barn burner. I imagine it's probably pretty awesome though. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5532.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5535.76s)]
*  Right, that shit's going up. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5536.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5537.76s)]

*  Let me ask you a question that I don't know if you can, you can shit on this if you want [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5579.76s)]
*  to. I do feel as a minority, there is within the industry a certain type that there's, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5582.52s)]
*  whatever it is, they're a little bit more comfortable with, and those guys get the shots [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5589.56s)]
*  first. And part of the reason I was so happy to see 85 South get the Netflix special is [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5593.32s)]
*  because I know how talented those guys are. And I remember being on Wild and Out. And [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5598.48s)]
*  I top to bottom, no disrespect to anybody on this couch, that's the most talented cast [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5602.5199999999995s)]
*  I've ever worked with. It's monsters everywhere. And I would go into agencies and be like, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5606.44s)]
*  I'm on Wild and Out. And they'd be like, we're looking for like a two broke girls kind of [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5610.84s)]
*  show. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5614.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5615.759999999999s)]
*  And I know as an Indian, they want a certain narrative. I feel like with black people, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5616.759999999999s)]
*  it's a little bit like we want black people that we're not quite so scared of. You're [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5620.04s)]
*  telling stories about some shit that's like. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5623.96s)]
*  They want the skin color to be diverse, but not necessarily the personality and experience. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5626.04s)]
*  And I don't know if that's like, I don't know if they're even aware of it. You know what [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5632.84s)]
*  I mean? Like, I wonder if it's like. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5637.2s)]
*  I remember there was a pilot and every pilot I've ever seen for an Indian is he's married [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5639.22s)]
*  to someone or in love with someone who's non Indian or can't get someone at all. And I [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5643.8s)]
*  just don't. I had a holding deal with ABC and I was like, I don't really want to audition [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5649.719999999999s)]
*  for this. I was in a position where I felt like I could say that. And she was like, why? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5653.04s)]
*  And I was like, well, I explained the reason. White exec in LA. And I don't think she wasn't [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5656.8s)]
*  racist at all. Poor girl truly didn't understand. She goes, but he's Indian. Like that was, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5660.48s)]
*  she couldn't understand it. That's not something I want. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5665.96s)]
*  You should be happy. You got something. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5668.08s)]
*  That is the perspective. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5670.08s)]
*  That is the perspective. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5671.08s)]
*  And there was a thing I, and I don't, that's why it's so beautiful that we have YouTube [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5672.08s)]
*  and you got double digit million views on one special and like you get to talk to your [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5675.92s)]
*  people and do it your way. And it's awesome. But I do think within the industry, there's [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5679.76s)]
*  a little bit of that and not to discredit anything you're saying. And you probably might [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5683.8s)]
*  be experiencing both, but I think there's a little bit of that. And I'd love to know [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5686.72s)]
*  your opinion on that. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5689.92s)]
*  I think we just isolated just to me because I can't speak for what they're looking for [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5692.2s)]
*  because some things that I have done, they have accepted from other people. I'm saying. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5697.76s)]
*  So I don't think that I think because they have not made me, they didn't have their hands [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5706.0s)]
*  and putting me together. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5713.2s)]
*  This is a massive thing that like, I think a lot of times people won't even like to admit [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5714.76s)]
*  it's taking ownership over someone's career is very important for people. Like they want [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5720.24s)]
*  to know even back in the MTV days, like MTV two and MTV were separate. And if you were [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5726.2s)]
*  popping on MTV to the MTV people, like, but that's not one of ours. We want to do it. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5731.4s)]
*  It's like it becomes part of their identity. And when you are quote unquote, made, I don't [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5736.48s)]
*  like self made, like made by the people, like the people decide community, they can't go. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5741.5199999999995s)]
*  We put him on. Exactly. And I do, I do agree with you. There is a little bit of a hesitation. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5746.639999999999s)]
*  They would, they've invested three specials or three things in this one person. Rather [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5753.4400000000005s)]
*  that person get this opportunity than this guy who did it on his own and forced his way [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5757.12s)]
*  in. But I'm telling you, it reaches a breaking point. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5761.28s)]
*  You know what it's title feels like early kids, like you feel like our guy, our secret [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5765.52s)]
*  that we consume and the rest of the world knows, even though clearly the rest of the [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5772.0s)]
*  world knows about you, but it's like, it just feels like, oh, that's our guy. And it's like, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5776.76s)]
*  we relate to everything. And I'm speaking from the black point of view. And Kev just [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5780.68s)]
*  got to a point where it's like, okay, undeniable Hollywood had to pay attention. And I feel [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5785.4800000000005s)]
*  like you're right there. I don't even compare it to Kev because I'm so out the box, like [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5790.16s)]
*  totally Indy. Yeah. And I love Kev, but Kev has Dave Becky, who's like the manager. Oh, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5802.76s)]
*  I don't know about all the behind the scenes type of stuff. But I just mean. Behind the [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5809.4s)]
*  scenes he had a machine, you know, three arts and David, he had a lot going on. It's no [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5812.16s)]
*  machine. I'm in Houston and I'm generating what I'm doing from Houston, from my hometown [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5820.92s)]
*  with my bread, with my own money. Like that's why I'm an executive producer. It probably [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5830.08s)]
*  just feels like that to me, just because I remember Kev like when passing around the [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5835.24s)]
*  DVDs, like being at the barbershop. And that's how I discovered Kevin Hart. I think you're [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5839.5199999999995s)]
*  right in terms of like public perception. Whereas like, I think the perception early [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5845.4s)]
*  on in Kev's career is like, he had some pilot, it didn't go. And then it's like, he's in [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5850.5599999999995s)]
*  the clubs. I think on the street, people aren't aware of like who your representation is. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5856.36s)]
*  It's more just like, oh, he's doing shows at Caroline's and he's grinding. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5861.22s)]
*  That's a normal thing for every comic. Every comic has a story where they were selling [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5864.820000000001s)]
*  their CDs and DVDs outside the club. Like that's a normal thing. That's not a, it's [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5869.780000000001s)]
*  not isolated to one person. I know I have people's DVDs that I use them as, remember [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5876.34s)]
*  this shit? I'm talking about before the DVDs. You know what I'm saying? So you had, well, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5885.42s)]
*  it was no DVDs. You had just people that had their stuff on CD where you would just listen. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5903.7s)]
*  It was, yeah, the audio. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5910.74s)]
*  Just the audio. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5912.9s)]
*  With a shitty printed cover. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5914.02s)]
*  Oh, the paper is paper that they just put in. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5917.14s)]
*  It's new and it's faded. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5923.14s)]
*  It wasn't even like, oh, this is just fade over time. No, this started off like that. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5927.02s)]
*  It is some weird ass picture of them with a microphone. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5931.22s)]
*  What you made is that Kinkos? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5935.820000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5937.62s)]
*  That's that's synonymous with the people who come up in that era. Errors are very important [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5939.62s)]
*  when you think about comedy, when you think about damn near anything. Like I was doing [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5946.740000000001s)]
*  an interview with Vlad and I was talking about Cain Goods. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5951.58s)]
*  If you didn't come on this pod and went on Vlad, I'd have been so pissed. I'd have been [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5957.7s)]
*  like, are you fucking kidding me? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5960.9400000000005s)]
*  They do. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5961.94s)]
*  It was pulling teeth. It was another. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5965.94s)]
*  I don't know Vlad. You're not going to get me to incriminate me with your old shit. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5972.339999999999s)]
*  I saw it, Parvin. You told a great story. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5979.0199999999995s)]
*  Willie D called me to do that. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5981.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5982.86s)]
*  It took a buffer. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5984.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5985.7s)]
*  Willie D called me and said, hey, man, listen, I know, I know. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5987.22s)]
*  He don't crack. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5991.099999999999s)]
*  He thought Willie saw it somewhere. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5992.099999999999s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5994.099999999999s)]
*  He didn't even say what it is yet. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5995.86s)]
*  I'm like, what's up? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5997.38s)]
*  Vlad's in town. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6000.58s)]
*  He want to interview. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6001.98s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6003.139999999999s)]
*  And he's like, leave, man, just do the shit. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6006.26s)]
*  And that's. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6010.7s)]
*  I thought it was good and I thought the views were crazy from it. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6012.22s)]
*  I got some other feedback about something else, but I ain't going to talk about that. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6015.9s)]
*  But Willie D is a buffer a lot of times when it comes to things. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6020.5s)]

*  I said, well, and I'd be like, what they say? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6051.54s)]

*  Because I'm not the crew dude. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6057.78s)]
*  And it's something about if you really if you got a crew of people and a person shows [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6060.22s)]
*  up by itself. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6066.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6071.82s)]
*  What? Why is he so comfortable? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6074.1s)]
*  We set a bunch of fire and he showed up by himself like he doesn't have a barb on it. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6078.7s)]
*  What is that? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6083.62s)]
*  And I'm like, yo, man, I I'll be on some John Wick shit. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6085.5s)]

*  I was mad, just these people and they thought because they had a bunch of people that I [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6099.7s)]
*  was not going to show up. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6104.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6106.94s)]
*  When I called my friend, I say, hey, do you have a stick of dynamite? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6107.94s)]

*  I'm so mad. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6128.179999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that's a crazy shit I've ever heard of. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6131.38s)]
*  Even if you didn't light it, if you just put it on the table for the energy and you're [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6132.38s)]
*  just playing with your lighter the whole day. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6137.46s)]
*  You're like, I got to look at this stick of dynamite. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6139.219999999999s)]
*  Because my my my friend tells me, you know, really, why we don't call you a lot of times [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6142.0199999999995s)]
*  when shit happens because you are fucking grenade with the pin out. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6149.14s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm not I'm not you have to you have to provoke you. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6154.26s)]
*  I have to be provoked. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6160.26s)]
*  Other than that, I'm just fucking happy go lucky. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6161.54s)]
*  I'm living my life. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6164.46s)]
*  That's what a grenade is. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6166.660000000001s)]
*  You are a grenade. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6173.3s)]
*  Yes, because with the pin in, it is no different than a baseball. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6174.34s)]
*  You throw it around your friends. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6177.14s)]
*  Everybody's playing catch. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6178.26s)]
*  It's like, all right, I'll leave. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6181.14s)]
*  Went off the fucking. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6182.02s)]
*  Everyone's dead now. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6183.700000000001s)]
*  But you know, what's weird is this. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6185.38s)]
*  Like you say, like Tom Segura. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6188.54s)]
*  Yeah, he loved Tom. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6190.46s)]
*  He wouldn't say that. Tom's like, he's fucking awesome. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6191.5s)]
*  Like when it when I'm around, it depends on the people that I'm around. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6195.02s)]
*  Yeah, because sometimes people be extra aggressive for no reason. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6199.1s)]
*  And I just be like towards you just in the room. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6202.860000000001s)]
*  Why do you think I could? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6206.5s)]
*  Because sometimes people really have. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6207.700000000001s)]
*  Is there an ego thing? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6210.42s)]
*  It's like sometimes an insecurity thing. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6211.3s)]
*  Yeah, this is why I always hated to go do certain shows. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6213.06s)]
*  Because I would do shows with Ari. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6219.06s)]
*  I know it's Ari. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6221.34s)]
*  And it's like everybody wants everybody to win. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6222.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. But then isn't there I'm going to go wreck this. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6225.3s)]
*  It's just all about them. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6228.22s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, man, this is a show for every fucking body. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6229.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6234.22s)]
*  And you can be around Bruce Bruce, Don DC Curry, some more. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6234.98s)]
*  And who else is on their show? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6242.099999999999s)]
*  Love, Lovell Crawford. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6246.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6247.66s)]
*  Happy as a clam on the show. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6248.94s)]
*  I'm the youngest one. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6252.379999999999s)]
*  I don't have no what they know. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6253.86s)]
*  They're like, yo, when they're going because he's going to go out. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6257.0599999999995s)]
*  But they know what it is. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6261.179999999999s)]
*  But you have me. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6262.9s)]
*  Then you get around some other people. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6263.78s)]
*  And there seems to be like a competitive. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6265.42s)]
*  Like, yeah, why are we competing? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6267.82s)]
*  I mean, you know this already. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6270.62s)]
*  It's like I think there is an insecurity with folks. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6272.299999999999s)]
*  And like sometimes people, the way that they present their insecurities is [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6274.86s)]
*  kind of debilitating to like building friendships and building any kind of community. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6281.54s)]
*  Like if somebody thinks that you're funnier than them, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6285.42s)]
*  there are people who are confident that are like, man, I'm a huge fan of yours, dude. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6288.7s)]
*  I fucking love that. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6292.38s)]
*  Like your your skill doesn't make them feel bad about themselves. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6293.38s)]
*  Exactly. But then there are some people who are like, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6298.26s)]
*  I got to find a way to cut him down because I think in my head he's better than me. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6301.18s)]
*  So I got to convince me he ain't shit. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6304.82s)]
*  And then you feel that animosity. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6307.62s)]
*  And I think that. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6309.86s)]
*  I think that is the worst version of at least our industry, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6311.82s)]
*  and I know it presents itself in other industries, too, but it's like [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6314.74s)]
*  that's the work, to be honest, like low key. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6318.54s)]
*  I think this is something that Rogan has helped in comedy because he's so supportive, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6321.26s)]
*  like he so wants to shine a light on people he thinks are talented that I think it got a lot of comics who are [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6326.660000000001s)]
*  generally kind of bitter and angry to be like, you know, maybe there's a different way that we could do this. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6332.660000000001s)]
*  There's enough. Yeah, there might be enough. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6338.46s)]
*  Like Rogan's mad at me. Why would that happen? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6340.34s)]
*  I don't know. I can't imagine. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6342.820000000001s)]
*  We talked. We talked all the time. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6345.26s)]
*  You guys had a great episode. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6346.9400000000005s)]
*  That had a lot of great episodes. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6348.34s)]
*  And then it's like, I can't even get back on the show no more. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6349.9800000000005s)]
*  He's not accepting my calls. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6352.58s)]
*  What did I do, Rogan? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6353.9400000000005s)]
*  He did tell me he was taking a break from black people. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6356.66s)]
*  You know, I reached out. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6369.06s)]
*  I'm like. I'm sure it's nothing. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6370.06s)]
*  It can't be. It's one of the things that people get busy. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6372.780000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6376.18s)]
*  But in our heads, we build it up. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6377.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, it's mad to me. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6378.5s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6380.58s)]
*  I'm like, I'm still around all your friends. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6382.26s)]
*  I can't. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6384.58s)]
*  Kill Tony. I'm coming to do it. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6385.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6387.26s)]
*  Oh, that's gonna be fun. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6388.58s)]
*  That would be fun. What are you going to do? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6389.780000000001s)]
*  Kill Tony? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6390.860000000001s)]
*  Probably in August, because he has so I'll still do it in June or something. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6392.06s)]
*  He has something going on. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6395.700000000001s)]
*  But Tony came to the club when I did the mothership. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6396.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6400.22s)]
*  And Tony's fucking crazy. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6401.38s)]
*  He's crazy. Tony's crazy. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6403.38s)]
*  Wild boy. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6404.860000000001s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6405.38s)]
*  And I like his crazy. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6407.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6409.06s)]
*  He walked in and said, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6411.5s)]
*  seems like your people showed up. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6415.74s)]
*  And I was like, but it's all white people out there, Tony. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6423.1s)]
*  He's like, oh, I didn't look. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6426.94s)]
*  I just know it was sold out. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6428.74s)]

*  No, Tony will give a fuck. I like it. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6436.22s)]
*  Tony's fucking mad. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6437.860000000001s)]

*  No, it's going to happen, man. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6443.26s)]
*  But the interesting thing is that, like, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6444.900000000001s)]
*  I'm curious once you see the industry support, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6447.42s)]
*  if you'll even care. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6451.02s)]
*  Because I think that you have the thing that matters the most, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6454.780000000001s)]
*  which is the people. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6457.7s)]
*  Like, this is something I learned early from Charlemagne, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6458.54s)]
*  and he's just the best at this. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6460.5s)]
*  He's like, you could either be a man of the industry [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6461.62s)]
*  or a man of the people. You can't be both. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6463.1s)]
*  And he always leaned into man of the people [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6464.700000000001s)]
*  because the people are what's going to, like... [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6467.620000000001s)]
*  Sustain you. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6469.46s)]
*  Sustain you. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6470.46s)]
*  If you're a man of the industry, like, you can look at all the Comedy Central comics. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6471.9800000000005s)]
*  They're like, they existed with Comedy Central. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6475.5s)]
*  And then as that started to dissolve... [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6477.58s)]
*  Comedy Central really... [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6481.54s)]
*  Oh, man, I just... [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6483.620000000001s)]
*  Big shout out to Ann Harris. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6486.26s)]

*  doing stuff with me. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6489.900000000001s)]
*  I was really confused when I did the hour special. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6491.98s)]
*  They showed it at 11.59. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6497.7s)]
*  It's like, who the hell is watching Comedy Central at midnight on a Friday or whatever? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6499.74s)]
*  And then they never showed it again. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6504.219999999999s)]
*  It's like... [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6507.219999999999s)]
*  And something told me this wasn't going to be the thing. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6510.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6514.219999999999s)]
*  So we just started putting eggs in a bunch of baskets. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6515.5s)]
*  You know, I went on Bring the Funny just to gain new fans. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6520.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6526.06s)]
*  And then people couldn't even see me because for some reason, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6527.06s)]
*  these damn senior citizens that watched Bring the Funny, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6530.74s)]
*  they was buying them tickets. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6534.06s)]
*  Like, my demographers went like, you know, everybody out here, 55 and up. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6535.860000000001s)]
*  You know, like... [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6541.18s)]
*  It was crazy. That's who watched the show. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6546.02s)]
*  I think that, like, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6548.9400000000005s)]
*  a lot of this stuff has taught me about how people view you as successful. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6551.820000000001s)]
*  So I got phone calls about Club Shay-Shay. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6557.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6562.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, we made it. It's over. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6563.9400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6565.860000000001s)]
*  OK, but you didn't call me when I was on Good Morning America. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6568.14s)]
*  Exactly. Dude, the game has changed. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6571.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6573.860000000001s)]
*  It's success is whatever they watch. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6574.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6577.38s)]
*  What is the... It's the term. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6578.299999999999s)]
*  It's like life is a Rorschach. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6579.299999999999s)]
*  Was it Rorschach? The ink block shit? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6581.099999999999s)]
*  It's like whatever you already feel, you see. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6582.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6586.78s)]
*  Like if you feel that Club Shay-Shay is the biggest platform, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6587.259999999999s)]
*  that to you is making it not being on this, like, traditional institution, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6592.459999999999s)]
*  which is Good Morning America. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6597.459999999999s)]
*  But how old are you? [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6598.98s)]
*  51. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6600.179999999999s)]
*  So you're 51. I'm 41. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6600.82s)]
*  Like, we grew up watching Good Morning America [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6602.58s)]
*  and seeing Tom Cruise on fucking Good Morning America. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6605.62s)]
*  So we're like, yo, that must be making it, being on Good Morning America. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6608.46s)]
*  To younger people, man, they're not watching Good Morning America. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6611.42s)]
*  It's like being on local news. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6614.18s)]
*  You ain't popped no balloon yet. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6616.66s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6624.82s)]
*  So it's one of those things that I felt [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6626.22s)]
*  that you have to be... [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6631.620000000001s)]
*  I feel that you have to be proud of your journey. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6633.620000000001s)]
*  Yes. You have to be proud of your journey, bro, no matter what happens. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6636.900000000001s)]
*  You know, and if... [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6640.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm still one of them guys who's still trying to kick over the table [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6642.9800000000005s)]
*  when it comes to you, the greatest comic of all times, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6646.26s)]
*  because you are in a movie or a sitcom. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6650.26s)]
*  Don't think that got nothing to do with the stand up comedy. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6653.06s)]
*  It has nothing to do with comedy. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6655.780000000001s)]
*  And so people are... [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6657.98s)]
*  And my thing with, like... [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6659.7s)]
*  When I say industry support, I mean the comedy community, right? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6664.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6668.66s)]
*  Don't call my phone and ask me a bunch of questions [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6669.86s)]
*  on how to do something and get a bunch of advice from me. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6673.099999999999s)]
*  Tell me how I'm the greatest and then I see you in the interview. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6676.46s)]
*  And you don't say much. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6679.339999999999s)]
*  And when you talk about the all these, your top five, these comments, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6680.339999999999s)]

*  And you're telling the joke that I fucking wrote for you. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6687.66s)]
*  But you're saying, but you're giving this credit to somebody. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6690.219999999999s)]
*  The amount of times I went through it, like I've seen this. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6694.58s)]
*  I'll walk people through their whole YouTube special rollout, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6697.98s)]

*  And I was like, oh, he and then I said, oh, he owns some Louis CK shit. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6822.1s)]

*  And you know, you won a Grammy a couple of years ago for an album. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6846.5s)]
*  They like they forgive you. Oh, yeah. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6849.339999999999s)]

*  So the thing is, when I saw, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6862.94s)]
*  I actually saw your thing, you had the guy with the smoke was coming out. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6868.0199999999995s)]
*  The oh, yeah. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6872.98s)]

*  I was like, and this is I told my friend, I don't say I'm on this. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6876.66s)]
*  You got all this fucking money. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6879.94s)]
*  I fired smoking. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6881.46s)]
*  But that was some broke shit. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6883.299999999999s)]
*  That was that was my that was my like fifth thing we put out. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6884.86s)]
*  So like the first one, matter of fact, the first one was super early. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6889.0199999999995s)]
*  The second one we did, we were in Europe. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6892.82s)]
*  And this is how this is how broke it was for one of the shoots. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6895.58s)]
*  We were in London. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6899.26s)]
*  We use a a gum to balance the camera. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6900.7s)]
*  Do you remember that? Like because we didn't have a tripod. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6905.58s)]
*  We ran out of tripods. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6908.54s)]
*  We know we could only travel with like two or three tripods. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6909.66s)]
*  So we got two sticks of gum and we put it under one part of the camera [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6912.139999999999s)]
*  and in the wide shot when people are laughing, you could see the camera. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6916.219999999999s)]
*  And it's not because of the tripods, because the gum wouldn't give us enough [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6920.42s)]
*  suspension or some shit. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6924.54s)]
*  So we went. I mean, it was just. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6926.0599999999995s)]
*  But whatever, I know the journey that you are on. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6928.82s)]
*  And I respect that majorly just because I've experienced it. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6931.82s)]
*  And when I started looking into yourself like, oh, he's [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6935.94s)]
*  getting it like he can, you know, yeah, not the mug. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6940.3s)]
*  Not the mug. And even with the Europe, Europe is fucking over me. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6943.46s)]
*  It's crazy. I've been to London countless times. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6948.78s)]
*  So now he passed his law. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6952.18s)]
*  If you've ever been convicted of a crime, you can't get in the country. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6953.58s)]
*  And I'm like, so we had a tour lined up [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6960.62s)]
*  to go to back to London. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6964.54s)]
*  And I get all this. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6967.9s)]
*  And when you come to the UK, I said, UK is kind of fucking over me. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6968.78s)]
*  I'm not made, you know, I should just 30 years ago. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6972.78s)]
*  Bro, this is actually crazy. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6977.14s)]
*  This is actually awesome because eventually they're just going to like lift that. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6978.9s)]
*  And then when you go, oh, yeah, it will be like this celebration. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6983.98s)]
*  I that's actually kind of cool. It sucks for now. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6987.98s)]
*  But let me let me call that uncle. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6990.7s)]
*  Eric Abrams, he always finds some good shit. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6994.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6998.099999999999s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about. This is what you mean right here. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6998.9s)]
*  You starve in them. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7001.0199999999995s)]
*  You starve in them. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7001.98s)]
*  And eventually when you're able to go, because they're not going to keep that shit forever. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7002.82s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, 30 fucking years ago, you're going to stop somebody from going over. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7006.099999999999s)]
*  Do you do something nearby? [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7010.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, can you do like Ireland or France or something? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7011.14s)]
*  Yeah. What about that? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7013.0599999999995s)]

*  I remember when they get the British people to come over. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7018.98s)]
*  They take a train to London and ask me to come. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7021.82s)]
*  Nobody in Ireland say nothing. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7024.0599999999995s)]
*  And I would even say that, like stylistically, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7027.26s)]
*  they would be way more used to what you're doing out there. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7031.18s)]
*  Like the long form storytelling is more similar to European [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7036.54s)]
*  and like British style stand up than American. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7041.38s)]
*  I've been over there. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7043.820000000001s)]

*  What do you call the crypto exchanges that have weathered the storm? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7070.98s)]
*  A lot of them folded. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7075.54s)]
*  Akash famously lost tons of money because why? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7076.86s)]
*  Because they weren't based on reality. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7080.62s)]
*  They did not have the support that they needed. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7082.98s)]
*  They were too frivolous, but not Kraken. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7085.379999999999s)]
*  Kraken has thugged it out and they are going to the moon. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7087.5s)]

*  See, you have a girl, a wife. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7518.26s)]
*  No, he got a wife and kid. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7521.66s)]
*  So you just call your girl good. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7523.46s)]
*  See, I can't call mine a lady who lives in my house. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7525.66s)]
*  She refuses to go by that. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7528.900000000001s)]
*  But when I said the shows, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7530.58s)]
*  that's when everybody comes up and says, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7533.22s)]
*  hey, this is the lady who lives in my house. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7535.54s)]
*  It's like, it's a fun thing. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7537.66s)]
*  The lady who lives in my house. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7538.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7540.9s)]
*  The roommate maybe. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7543.74s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7547.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's because you're on the road for so long, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7548.78s)]
*  you develop a very specific set of skills, right? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7553.5s)]
*  And they're, thank God, appreciated by a lot of people. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7556.7s)]
*  And we can provide and we can do these things. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7560.9s)]
*  But because of that, we never develop [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7562.62s)]
*  the most basic skills at home. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7565.22s)]
*  I love that. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7567.58s)]
*  So the special is really about you [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7568.9s)]
*  spending a little home time [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7571.38s)]
*  and just being completely unequipped. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7572.46s)]
*  And she is really- [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7574.139999999999s)]
*  You gotta bring up prison. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7574.98s)]
*  You're like, I was locked up [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7575.82s)]
*  when I should have learned this shit. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7576.9s)]
*  And it was crazy. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7579.099999999999s)]
*  I was very good at useless shit in prison. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7580.3s)]
*  Like I could start all types of shit. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7583.099999999999s)]
*  I could fix everything that I need to fix. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7585.46s)]
*  I fixed my ankle. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7587.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7588.26s)]
*  Like- [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7589.1s)]
*  I think this is myself. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7589.94s)]
*  But this is, man, and she's always talking shit. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7594.34s)]

*  So that's rugged. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7603.18s)]
*  And rugged is fun. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7606.02s)]
*  It's just fun. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7608.26s)]
*  How long you been married? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7609.1s)]
*  Shit. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7611.58s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7615.46s)]
*  22 years. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7617.54s)]

*  Wow. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7620.54s)]
*  I love the way you put out material. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7622.1s)]
*  It's always like chronological of your life. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7623.46s)]
*  And so this new special is where you're at now. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7625.54s)]
*  But there's one thing from the second one [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7628.42s)]
*  that I was bawling crying. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7632.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7634.86s)]
*  When you tell a story about your younger sister, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7635.7s)]
*  God bless her dead. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7637.66s)]
*  But like, boy, I've never been laughing hysterically, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7638.9s)]
*  then bawling crying, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7643.26s)]
*  and then immediately right back to laughs. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7644.74s)]
*  I've never seen a special that made me do that before. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7646.54s)]
*  How many times have you told that story on stage? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7648.34s)]
*  Because you're also- [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7649.98s)]
*  Never. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7650.82s)]
*  That was the first time you did it. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7651.66s)]
*  Because the way he's crying, dog, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7652.9s)]
*  that's what got me, aside from the story. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7654.82s)]
*  But I was like, there's no way you've run this 50 times. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7656.9s)]
*  I didn't run that special period. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7660.7s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7662.74s)]

*  This is my favorite part. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7666.94s)]
*  This is Domino Effect part two. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7667.78s)]
*  Part two. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7668.78s)]
*  So Joe, nobody knew what I was doing. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7669.86s)]
*  I just told them how I wanted it to look. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7674.3s)]
*  And they was like, well, you give us something. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7678.06s)]
*  I'm like, I got it. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7680.1s)]

*  And- [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7683.900000000001s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7684.74s)]
*  We did it, we recorded it. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7685.66s)]
*  It was no running of that. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7688.66s)]
*  It was no- [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7691.62s)]
*  Did you know you were gonna tell that story? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7692.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7694.02s)]
*  Okay, so you knew going into- [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7694.860000000001s)]
*  I knew the years. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7695.9400000000005s)]
*  So it was- [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7697.18s)]
*  And you mapped it out in your room. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7698.02s)]
*  It was no way to skip- [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7698.860000000001s)]
*  That part. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7701.46s)]
*  That part. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7702.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7703.14s)]
*  I knew- [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7704.86s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7706.0199999999995s)]
*  Because he had asked the question, [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7706.86s)]
*  did I know I was gonna put it out in that order? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7709.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7711.66s)]
*  So we did Domino Effect one, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7712.5s)]
*  and then people asked what was the rest of the story. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7714.419999999999s)]
*  So then I did two. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7718.9s)]
*  So we went from 10, you know what I'm saying, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7720.86s)]
*  to 16, then we went from 16. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7725.299999999999s)]
*  So we just, we went in order of the years. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7729.5s)]
*  No, see, I thought you had this whole thing mapped out, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7732.14s)]
*  part one to part- [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7734.38s)]
*  No. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7735.22s)]
*  So you did part one. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7736.06s)]
*  We didn't have it, we mapped it out after one, [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7736.900000000001s)]
*  after the success of one. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7740.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7741.5s)]
*  And people wanted to know the story, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7742.34s)]
*  so we figured we would just do, after two, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7743.18s)]
*  I knew I was gonna do three and four. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7747.34s)]
*  But it was no, like, if I tell you, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7749.34s)]
*  and it's like with me, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7757.900000000001s)]
*  I don't talk about other people's craft, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7759.38s)]
*  that's what they doing. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7761.3s)]
*  But when I watch somebody else try to create that moment, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7763.5s)]
*  it's like you're discrediting a very honest- [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7770.14s)]
*  Thing, yeah. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7773.9400000000005s)]
*  Moment. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7774.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7775.62s)]
*  Because I knew, without running it, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7776.46s)]
*  I knew as soon as I got to that part, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7781.78s)]
*  I started feeling it. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7786.7s)]
*  Feeling it, yeah. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7789.7s)]
*  And my older sister is in the audience. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7791.58s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7793.78s)]

*  my account of what happened, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7798.82s)]
*  because she had went back to the Navy. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7800.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7803.9s)]
*  And I don't think people understand, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7806.179999999999s)]
*  my little sister is like the heartbeat of me. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7808.219999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7814.78s)]
*  It's like, it's a different, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7815.62s)]
*  this is like the purest happiness before my kids. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7821.259999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7825.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7826.54s)]
*  So she's tattooed on me twice. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7827.379999999999s)]
*  It's a thing when it comes to her, you know? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7834.179999999999s)]
*  So it was no way that I could- [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7836.46s)]

*  Because it's so, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7888.5s)]
*  man, I think this is the most damaging thing [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7892.179999999999s)]
*  ever in my whole life. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7896.5s)]

*  But, and I'm, the reason why I'm there [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7901.62s)]
*  is because she's gone. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7906.38s)]
*  Because this turned me into something different. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7909.780000000001s)]
*  I was a different, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7912.820000000001s)]

*  I would stop doing whatever I was doing [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7918.9800000000005s)]
*  to make sure I went to pick her up from school. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7920.900000000001s)]

*  because it's still the connection- [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7928.9800000000005s)]
*  That you have with your little sister. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7930.98s)]

*  Wow. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7943.94s)]
*  When I'm in positions, and she was only eight. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7944.78s)]
*  And I was like, yo, man, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7948.82s)]

*  street dude, he is on one. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8000.58s)]

*  Like he was around. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8012.66s)]
*  And [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8015.34s)]
*  it pops into my head out of nowhere. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8018.74s)]
*  Cause I was asking him like, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8020.66s)]
*  yo, you're gonna have to help me through this, y'all. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8021.860000000001s)]
*  And then Pops came to my head. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8025.74s)]
*  This dude who used to sell dope for us. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8028.5s)]
*  During that time, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8030.9800000000005s)]
*  the only person that could make me laugh was Pops. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8032.9400000000005s)]
*  Cause I would come to the cook house [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8036.82s)]
*  and he would be in the Speedos cooking drugs. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8038.46s)]
*  And I was like, yo, man, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8042.1s)]

*  And he had on Speedos. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8054.62s)]
*  I'm like, yo, man, what you got going on? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8055.7s)]
*  Hey, man, don't worry about what the chef got on. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8057.1s)]
*  He should be like, Pops. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8059.26s)]
*  I'm like, yo, man, this is a crazy person. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8062.26s)]
*  So that helped me to remember that moment. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8064.62s)]
*  Why? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8070.38s)]
*  And I was digging in my head. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8071.22s)]
*  What made you laugh at this time? [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8073.54s)]
*  And it was only Pops. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8078.38s)]
*  And he thought of that during the taping. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8079.22s)]
*  During the taping. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8080.9s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8081.74s)]
*  Cause after the thing, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8082.58s)]
*  you're crying, it's like beautiful. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8084.54s)]
*  Then afterward you talk about the anger, [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8086.42s)]
*  which most people don't talk about. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8088.62s)]
*  Most people don't think about when they think about loss. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8090.78s)]
*  And I remember you said it with this fury. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8092.94s)]
*  I was like, there's no way he's ever said this before. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8095.3s)]
*  It turned me into a fucking monster. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8097.139999999999s)]
*  I will fucking kill you. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8099.5s)]

*  There's no way he's run this a hundred times. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8109.179999999999s)]
*  It's just not possible. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8110.74s)]
*  I only cry because I have regret of time [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8111.9s)]
*  that I didn't spend. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8117.3s)]
*  With her, yeah. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8118.34s)]
*  That I could have been doing, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8121.179999999999s)]
*  but I'm out doing other bullshit. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8122.42s)]
*  Okay, you going to pick up from school, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8124.42s)]
*  you spending time with her, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8125.86s)]
*  but you could have did more that probably wouldn't have. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8126.98s)]
*  And it's not even, it wasn't even my [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8131.74s)]
*  thought pattern at the time. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8137.66s)]

*  But how much you love this little girl [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8140.9s)]
*  and the moments that you did, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8145.9s)]
*  like I can't look at Ashley furniture truck [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8148.9s)]
*  and not think about her. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8152.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8153.98s)]
*  Because I'll never forget the time we walking home [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8154.82s)]
*  and she let my hand go and start running. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8157.46s)]
*  I'm like, what you doing? [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8161.38s)]
*  She said, you gotta come on. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8162.22s)]
*  I gotta catch this man. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8163.18s)]
*  He got my truck. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8164.1s)]
*  Cause it said her name on the side. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8165.94s)]
*  And when she dressed up like a Halloween, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8168.1s)]
*  she had on all black and she had her face painted [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8171.66s)]
*  like a cat. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8173.98s)]
*  And I was like, what you got going on? [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8175.38s)]
*  She's like, mew, mew. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8176.94s)]
*  And it's like all of these things. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8178.46s)]
*  And when she passed, I was sitting in her room [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8180.18s)]
*  and I would hear her in the closet playing. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8185.34s)]
*  Like she normally would be doing. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8189.62s)]
*  And I know how devastating this was for my family. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8191.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8195.06s)]
*  It's like crippled my mom. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8196.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8197.9s)]
*  Cause this was, and then I learned why crippled my mom. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8198.74s)]
*  This was the first time that my mom was in a comfortable [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8204.22s)]
*  position that she could actually raise. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8206.98s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8211.539999999999s)]
*  So she took care of us. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8214.5s)]
*  But she raised. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8217.3s)]
*  But she raised her. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8218.38s)]
*  And so this is me understanding why this was, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8221.339999999998s)]
*  my mom asked me all the time, hey, was I a good mom? [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8225.46s)]
*  You know, you know I love you, right? [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8230.539999999999s)]
*  And it's because this is the effects of her [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8232.939999999999s)]
*  not completing the job. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8236.38s)]
*  She's never got a chance to comfortably raise a child. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8239.58s)]
*  You know, it was, you know, me and my sister, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8245.06s)]
*  she had us early. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8247.539999999999s)]
*  You know, my mom had me, she 20 years old. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8249.22s)]
*  And my sister two years older than me. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8252.66s)]
*  So she just going through life, just taking care of us. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8255.18s)]
*  But now she's in our, she's established. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8259.7s)]
*  And she for eight years, she's raising. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8262.5s)]
*  She's leaning in. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8265.42s)]
*  She's all in. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8266.46s)]
*  She's getting everything that she, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8267.3s)]
*  she's gonna do everything that she never got a chance to do. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8269.14s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8272.539999999999s)]
*  That's an angle. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8273.38s)]
*  And then for family members never to have seen her living. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8276.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8282.939999999999s)]
*  Cause she lived out of town [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8284.58s)]
*  and they were always planning to come [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8286.14s)]
*  and never got a chance to. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8288.019999999999s)]
*  And the first time my grandmother [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8289.3s)]
*  is seeing her grandchild in a box. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8291.859999999999s)]
*  What is it you think about, [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8296.619999999999s)]
*  and I'm reacting to your concern about, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8300.62s)]
*  I'm sure there was some reactions that people were like, [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8305.34s)]
*  oh, is this put on for multiple shows or whatever? [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8308.06s)]
*  What is it about you think, [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8313.14s)]
*  maybe it's even comedians like our contemporaries, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8315.34s)]
*  that why do you think they felt the need [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8318.42s)]
*  to try to discredit that moment? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8321.82s)]
*  I really tried not to make sense out of nonsense. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8326.06s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8329.58s)]
*  Cause maybe it was a, [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8333.14s)]
*  this is not something I could have did [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8335.78s)]
*  or whatever the situation may have been. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8337.9s)]
*  I think you're onto something right now. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8340.02s)]
*  But I know the theory that I, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8342.18s)]
*  somebody said something to me on the internet [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8348.1s)]
*  in the rage that I responded with. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8353.42s)]
*  Speaking about my sister. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8358.94s)]
*  What'd they say? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8360.94s)]
*  It's some weird shit that I don't even really remember. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8364.98s)]
*  I was so mad, like it was a fake thing or some shit. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8368.94s)]
*  And I said, I remember, I just remember what I said. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8375.140000000001s)]
*  I promise you on everything that I'm gonna hunt you down. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8382.18s)]
*  And I'm gonna break your fucking neck backwards. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8388.54s)]
*  Cause you speaking, you're speaking on, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8394.7s)]
*  I remember a dude, I'm beating him in basketball in prison. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8403.140000000001s)]
*  And he said something about, [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8409.82s)]
*  I don't worry about it. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8414.06s)]
*  I'm finna do something, whatever he said, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8415.34s)]
*  like that bitch that's tattooed on your chest. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8417.9s)]
*  Does he know? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8420.34s)]
*  Is he aware at the time? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8421.34s)]
*  You got a pretty good idea. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8422.42s)]
*  But he doesn't know the story. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8424.939999999999s)]
*  He doesn't know his muscle, he don't know nothing. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8426.859999999999s)]
*  And I never forget this brother named Black Show. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8430.099999999999s)]
*  The look that he gave, that he knew. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8434.42s)]
*  When I threw the basketball and hit him in the face, [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8439.9s)]
*  and this was the first time [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8443.26s)]
*  they'd ever see me come loose ever. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8444.94s)]
*  And then I had to get talked to. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8451.06s)]
*  He said, bro, people not gonna know. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8457.26s)]
*  They just talking. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8460.58s)]
*  And that dude was severely injured. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8464.380000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, and every time I saw him, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8469.9s)]
*  I just, I only felt. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8475.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you couldn't detach it. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8477.98s)]
*  I couldn't detach from the situation. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8480.14s)]
*  And I know now it's people that are troll you [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8484.939999999999s)]
*  to try to get a response out of you to make you, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8488.74s)]
*  and I've probably gotten it under control now. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8492.98s)]
*  But to, with that particular special, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8497.34s)]
*  the criticism of people. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8511.02s)]
*  Think he was manufactured. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8513.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8515.900000000001s)]
*  I think it's people's, I think there's a distrust [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8516.740000000002s)]
*  a lot of times when it comes to entertainment. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8521.380000000001s)]
*  And it's this idea that it's like this thing [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8524.46s)]
*  that's workshopped and put on. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8526.539999999999s)]
*  And they're feeling these very real emotions. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8529.179999999998s)]
*  And they don't know how to handle those real emotions. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8535.259999999998s)]
*  They either have to accept that they themselves [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8537.98s)]
*  are also touched by this moment, enraged by this moment, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8541.099999999999s)]
*  broken by this moment, or they don't accept those feelings. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8544.66s)]
*  And they go, ah, this isn't real. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8549.539999999999s)]
*  This person is not putting it on. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8551.339999999998s)]
*  And I think it's an inability to accept [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8553.14s)]
*  that that moment is maybe punishing them as well. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8556.22s)]
*  And especially if you're a comic, a peer, a competitor. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8560.18s)]
*  You're cynical. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8563.18s)]
*  Or you're also watching. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8564.22s)]
*  You have to belittle everything [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8565.26s)]
*  that is beautiful or successful. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8566.82s)]
*  Because you're watching, I'm watching that moment. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8568.46s)]
*  And in my honest reaction, I didn't discredit it. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8570.099999999999s)]
*  Both of them hit me up and they're like, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8571.58s)]
*  dude, I'm bawling. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8574.14s)]
*  I'm bawling watching this thing. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8575.74s)]
*  Now, what I would say about us specifically, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8577.619999999999s)]
*  I think it's like a cultural thing on the pod, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8579.939999999999s)]
*  which is like, there is a celebration [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8582.22s)]
*  for things that are great. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8585.699999999999s)]
*  We try to reduce cynicism. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8586.779999999999s)]
*  And it's hard. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8588.22s)]
*  But like, if there is something that is beautiful, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8589.66s)]
*  the knee-jerk reaction shouldn't be to undercut it. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8593.06s)]
*  Because I was watching, like, [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8596.5s)]
*  I don't know if I could get this reaction out of an audience. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8599.019999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I have that level of, thank God, pain, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8601.019999999999s)]
*  or rage, or whatever. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8603.98s)]
*  And I don't know if I'd have the balls to do that. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8605.699999999999s)]
*  And I'm watching thinking, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8608.34s)]
*  this must be the first time he's done it. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8609.34s)]
*  So that is a reaction I had, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8610.94s)]
*  but you gotta try to fight against that party [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8612.380000000001s)]
*  that wants to discredit it and be like, [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8614.140000000001s)]
*  hey, I have a different purpose from God, whatever, [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8615.54s)]
*  when I'm on that stage. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8618.300000000001s)]
*  But that moment, I do remember being like, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8619.220000000001s)]
*  and that's why I was like, you guys need to fuck. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8621.5s)]
*  This is fuck. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8623.66s)]
*  I've never felt this watching anything. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8624.7s)]
*  I've never felt this. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8626.82s)]
*  And I don't know if I could elicit that reaction. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8627.82s)]
*  But a lot of people, instead of just accepting that [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8629.66s)]
*  and saying, I have a different purpose, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8631.62s)]
*  or I'll do it differently, or whatever, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8632.7s)]
*  will be like, yeah, but he X, Y, Z. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8633.980000000001s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8636.26s)]
*  That's where it comes from. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8637.460000000001s)]
*  And I think the people that was there, [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8638.580000000002s)]
*  if people listen to the audience, it's people crying. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8645.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8650.18s)]
*  What was the feeling like coming off stage? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8651.78s)]
*  Was it cathartic for you? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8653.980000000001s)]
*  When I came off, I was met by my sister. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8656.300000000001s)]
*  I just went into my sister's arms when it was over. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8660.900000000001s)]
*  I wish they hadn't. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8666.300000000001s)]
*  It was such a... [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8667.14s)]
*  The camera people, Eric was like, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8671.9s)]
*  yeah, I'm glad you didn't send. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8678.46s)]
*  I'm glad you didn't do anything with this. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8681.22s)]
*  It was no way that we could have known going into this. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8684.019999999999s)]
*  This would have been very hard. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8689.42s)]
*  And to... [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8691.98s)]
*  I think it was a bigger purpose for me to do it than not. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8696.82s)]
*  I needed some relief from it. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8704.98s)]
*  I know how many, and the fact that I'm going through losses. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8709.699999999999s)]
*  And people are going through losses. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8715.46s)]
*  And from the losing the girl, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8717.5s)]
*  how unprepared we are for losing anybody. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8721.259999999998s)]
*  And you say a thing early in the part two, [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8728.539999999999s)]
*  which is like, when people talk about this game, [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8730.14s)]
*  drug dealing or whatever, they never talk about the losses. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8732.38s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you about the losses. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8734.779999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you about what is going on [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8736.019999999999s)]
*  in a person's life that's going through this. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8739.14s)]
*  It's a lot of A's in this. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8744.46s)]
*  What I think is profound about these moments, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8747.18s)]
*  and you rarely see them as standup, [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8750.02s)]
*  but it's like, it's not just about your loss. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8751.34s)]
*  There are countless people who have had losses [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8755.66s)]
*  that don't always get to process their emotions [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8759.22s)]
*  in the same way. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8762.98s)]
*  And they're processing their losses [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8764.94s)]
*  while they're watching it. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8768.38s)]
*  The people that know you are thinking about your sister. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8769.3s)]
*  The people that don't know you, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8772.22s)]
*  thinking about the people. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8774.06s)]
*  And in my last special, I have a moment that is, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8776.419999999998s)]
*  my wife and I, it was really tough for us to get pregnant. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8782.259999999998s)]
*  It was very tough. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8784.259999999998s)]
*  And we were able to do it. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8786.099999999999s)]
*  And I didn't know at the moment when I'm writing the special [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8789.099999999999s)]
*  that people struggled with this shit. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8791.66s)]
*  I had no fucking clue. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8793.019999999999s)]
*  And when we were starting to go on the road, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8794.619999999999s)]
*  and there's this montage of my wife [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8796.939999999999s)]
*  getting to see our daughter for the first time. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8798.859999999999s)]
*  And you go to see these people in the crowd. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8801.179999999998s)]
*  And at first I was like, [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8803.86s)]
*  oh, that's beautiful that they're reacting to my story. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8805.02s)]
*  And then I started to realize, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8807.060000000001s)]
*  they're reacting to their story. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8808.02s)]
*  They're reacting to like their trials and tribulations, [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8810.300000000001s)]
*  the joy that they have with their kid, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8812.980000000001s)]
*  the struggles they've had trying to get it. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8815.300000000001s)]
*  And it's like, I wonder if that moment, [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8817.62s)]
*  despite some fucking cynical idiots criticism, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8820.78s)]
*  I wonder if that moment creates this deep connection [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8823.82s)]
*  with the people that are watching that special. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8828.82s)]
*  Like deep connection, [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8831.02s)]
*  where people start to process those feelings [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8833.46s)]
*  that they've probably kept bottled up for a long time. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8835.859999999999s)]
*  And also to see a dude, you might not call yourself tough, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8838.06s)]
*  but like a tougher dude break down like that. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8840.5s)]
*  Imagine what that gives you. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8843.98s)]
*  Imagine as a consumer, imagine what that gives you, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8846.699999999999s)]
*  the freedom to, all right, [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8848.859999999999s)]
*  maybe I'm allowed to process this shit [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8849.74s)]
*  and feel this shit a little bit. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8851.26s)]
*  You know, I didn't speak about like our funeral [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8852.58s)]
*  because my dad, right, my mom, my dad, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8856.9s)]
*  been separated for a long time. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8862.699999999999s)]
*  And inside the funeral, all these people in there, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8865.699999999999s)]
*  but when I walk out, [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8871.94s)]
*  my dad is like in the corner of the parking lot, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8875.66s)]
*  black leather coat, and he's standing there. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8880.82s)]
*  And he's just crying. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8885.94s)]
*  Had nothing to do with this, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8890.78s)]
*  but he, for some reason, he wanted to be there for, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8893.1s)]
*  we talking about somebody who's not there for most shit. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8899.980000000001s)]
*  And he just like, and I never forget looking at him. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8902.78s)]
*  Was it his daughter or was it him? [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8907.86s)]
*  No, he's totally out of the picture. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8908.7s)]
*  He was like, but he was standing there like, [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8912.82s)]
*  man, this shit tough, bro. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8917.5s)]
*  And he's always been the, my mom, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8919.7s)]
*  my mom is tough as rusty nails. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8924.38s)]
*  My dad has always been the- [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8927.1s)]
*  Unflappable. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8930.82s)]
*  I'm just here. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8933.619999999999s)]
*  I know what a moment is and if you need me, I'm here. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8935.5s)]
*  My mom is trying to keep it together, [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8941.02s)]
*  but she is, it's like my mom falls apart. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8944.82s)]
*  And I never, until I realized why it's like this. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8951.1s)]
*  And to this day, it pains her. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8957.34s)]
*  Like my pain is one thing, but you talk to my mom, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8963.06s)]

*  Never told her it happened. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8979.3s)]
*  This is the one thing that I never told her that I did. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8980.14s)]
*  And you don't think- [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8986.38s)]
*  My sister may have told her and I don't even think she did. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8987.5s)]
*  I don't even like leading her down the road. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8993.54s)]
*  So I never even mentioned Domino effect to her. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8995.42s)]
*  Wow. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8998.58s)]
*  Never even mentioned it. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8999.5s)]
*  I was wondering because you had people [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9001.18s)]
*  in your life, you have your older sister talking [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9002.42s)]

*  hey, I saw the special, but I'm not bringing it up. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9021.98s)]
*  Cause you don't want her to have to live through that pain? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9026.86s)]
*  I don't want her to have to live through nothing. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9028.58s)]
*  Don't you hate that? [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9031.539999999999s)]

*  I was like, damn, what size you are? [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9063.02s)]
*  You just like, this is fat, man. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9065.58s)]
*  I'm feeling sauces on his nails. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9067.539999999999s)]
*  I tried to hide it in my armpit. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9069.859999999999s)]
*  What a gift. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9075.02s)]
*  You were talking about some real painful shit [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9075.859999999999s)]
*  and then right into the funny [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9077.34s)]
*  and you're just living in the moment. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9078.699999999999s)]
*  I don't see you. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9080.22s)]
*  When he did it, I was like- [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9081.22s)]
*  He fell for me. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9083.699999999999s)]
*  I fell for you. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9084.74s)]
*  I was like- [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9085.58s)]
*  Talking about your dead sister [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9087.26s)]
*  and having empathy for his stain is crazy. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9088.38s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9090.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9091.62s)]
*  I'm like, fuck this sweater. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9092.460000000001s)]
*  I feel like the ketchup is there. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9095.34s)]
*  Again, it's not. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9096.86s)]
*  It was coffee too. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9098.06s)]
*  I was hoping it was just some of the moisture on the ice. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9099.22s)]
*  Ice. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9102.06s)]
*  I was like, it's just water. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9102.9s)]
*  It's not plain. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9105.06s)]
*  I was like, it's goddamn coffee. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9105.9s)]
*  But as a comic, [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9109.86s)]
*  I think that's your, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9112.94s)]
*  that's the craft. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9116.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9117.42s)]
*  Not the job. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9118.26s)]
*  That's the craft. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9119.1s)]
*  If you look at this as a job, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9120.18s)]
*  I wouldn't show up. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9122.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9125.060000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't show up to this shit as a job. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9125.9s)]
*  As soon as I start feeling like it's a job, I take off. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9128.9s)]
*  Like, I'm getting ready to go to Greece [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9132.460000000001s)]
*  just so I can wear some Speedos and think I'm sexy. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9135.66s)]
*  All them fat bastards over there just wearing Speedos. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9138.82s)]
*  And I'm going to do it too. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9142.619999999999s)]
*  It's just the experience, man. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9146.74s)]
*  As a standup, [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9149.42s)]
*  what I said, I said a standup one time, this old dude said, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9153.14s)]
*  no, you'll fucking sit down. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9157.06s)]
*  You don't do shit but sit down and talk. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9158.619999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you right. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9160.5s)]
*  But I think that's the part that you have to be brave. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9162.5s)]
*  Everything that we say, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9169.86s)]
*  when you actually in the craft is brave. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9173.02s)]
*  You know, you speaking about you and your wife [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9177.06s)]
*  trying to conceive. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9179.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9180.26s)]
*  When you said, when she first got a chance to see it, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9181.1s)]
*  she was in a NICU. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9184.06s)]
*  She, it was a C-section. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9185.46s)]
*  So she, there's this big curtain up. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9186.9s)]
*  So you don't actually get to see the baby pulled out of you [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9189.66s)]
*  and you're numb. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9191.66s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9192.5s)]
*  So the baby gets. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9193.34s)]
*  I'm just thinking, was it a. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9194.18s)]
*  No, it wasn't pre-me. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9196.58s)]
*  It was two terms, yeah. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9197.5s)]
*  As soon as you said it, it took me to the moment to where [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9200.5s)]
*  I didn't get a chance to really connect with Hanan [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9204.18s)]
*  because she was in a NICU for two weeks. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9209.619999999999s)]
*  And they just put her like in this incubator. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9212.82s)]
*  She just flapping around. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9215.02s)]
*  And you got to put on all this stuff to go see him. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9217.34s)]
*  And it's no real connection. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9222.02s)]
*  And I couldn't wait to be able to touch Hanan. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9223.3s)]
*  And Hanan is like the manager of all the kids. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9232.18s)]
*  Like, even though she's young, she's nine, [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9242.18s)]
*  but she's the manager. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9245.74s)]
*  Hanan is who I talk to about finances. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9247.62s)]
*  Hanan knows all my money is. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9252.18s)]
*  She don't have to be the one divvying them. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9255.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9256.58s)]
*  Dig up the begonias. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9257.5s)]
*  Yeah, Hanan, man, that's my girl. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9261.34s)]
*  And she reminds me of my sister so much. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9266.22s)]
*  This is who I talk to. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9272.86s)]
*  So now imagine this. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9275.460000000001s)]
*  Imagine having a fear of losing your kid. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9278.62s)]
*  Like I'm not really comfortable until they pass eight. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9288.58s)]
*  Dude. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9293.140000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9294.26s)]
*  I was going to ask. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9295.300000000001s)]
*  Until they pass eight, I have this whole thing. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9296.140000000001s)]
*  Like until they pass eight, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9299.660000000002s)]
*  it's like I'm on pins and needles. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9302.980000000001s)]
*  Hold your breath. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9305.060000000001s)]
*  Hold your breath. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9306.42s)]
*  Like, please don't let nothing happen to them. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9307.26s)]
*  Like any of them. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9313.38s)]
*  And I remember Jayden, Jayden is a chef. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9315.22s)]
*  She's a wonderful chef. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9318.74s)]
*  I was so scared. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9323.5s)]
*  Bro, I remember this whole tumultuous journey [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9326.1s)]
*  to get to this moment and everything [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9331.34s)]
*  that could have gone wrong, [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9332.86s)]
*  went wrong up to this moment. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9335.060000000001s)]
*  And we're in there and my wife's not dilating [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9336.34s)]
*  and she's all up on the pitocin and all these things [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9340.9s)]
*  that they get and she's still not dilating. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9343.74s)]
*  And there's a moment where the baby's heart rate [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9346.18s)]
*  dropped on the monitor. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9350.58s)]
*  And keep in mind, like I have not the same level of concern, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9351.94s)]
*  but you're still like, something's going to go wrong [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9354.98s)]
*  because everything has gone wrong on this process. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9357.02s)]
*  Every single thing has gone wrong. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9359.380000000001s)]
*  And I start to see this monitor drop [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9360.94s)]
*  and then comes back up and the monitor drop. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9362.7s)]
*  And then the monitor is dropping, it's beeping for a while. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9364.42s)]
*  And I'm like running in the hallway looking for a nurse [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9366.22s)]
*  because in my head, I'm like, it can't go right. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9368.02s)]
*  I haven't felt anything go right. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9371.14s)]
*  So why would anything go right? [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9372.66s)]
*  And you think like once you see the baby [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9374.7s)]
*  that everything's going to be okay, [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9379.82s)]
*  but the fear doesn't go away. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9381.14s)]
*  You're like, they're like, okay, we need a test [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9382.86s)]
*  to make sure that she can see and hear. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9384.62s)]
*  You know, they do that. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9387.74s)]
*  And you're like, okay, now is the moment. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9388.58s)]
*  And I literally felt maybe until she was like walking [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9389.98s)]
*  and running, that was the first time I felt [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9393.98s)]
*  like I could take a deep breath. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9397.06s)]
*  So I can't even imagine what that's like for eight years. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9399.98s)]
*  Just looking at each one of your kids and just going, [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9403.539999999999s)]
*  please, like, when can I relax? [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9406.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9410.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it's, if they may get grown [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9411.66s)]
*  and you hope you don't get a call or something. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9415.859999999999s)]
*  Like Jane is 26 and I'm concerned about her every day. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9420.54s)]
*  So it just doesn't go away. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9430.54s)]
*  We're just stressed until we got here. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9432.18s)]
*  I've heard the fear doesn't go away. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9433.220000000001s)]
*  The fears just change. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9434.5s)]

*  Shit [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10177.5s)]
*  Jay Prince is the mogul like that we watch him come up, you know [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10178.94s)]
*  He's one of the first independent rap labels. That's why our city is so independent [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10184.740000000002s)]
*  We've never been looking for deals due to the prototype of what? [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10190.54s)]
*  Jay and and other guys [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10196.4s)]
*  Cultivated so [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10199.679999999998s)]
*  when you I [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10201.76s)]
*  Don't even know if what he is just a Houston, but it's just to the whole hip-hop industry [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10203.48s)]
*  he was he was really different from puffy and sugar and and and [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10208.08s)]
*  Everybody else because he was the format. He was a formula when there was no formula [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10214.4s)]
*  It's like how else can we get on how else can we create music and be part of this industry which seems to have a [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10220.2s)]
*  Lot of gatekeeping and he was like, well, we'll just create our own version of it [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10226.960000000001s)]
*  Which is why Houston has this flourishing hip-hop scene. That's not reliance on any major record label [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10231.76s)]
*  There's all these independent hip-hop musicians in Houston and it's influenced [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10239.04s)]
*  music in general [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10244.480000000001s)]
*  Without this like label push I must say this with gusto our artists [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10246.64s)]
*  laugh [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10253.359999999999s)]

*  That's cool, we've been doing right and I think because you're doing it on your own it's like [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10304.36s)]
*  It doesn't permeate [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10311.800000000001s)]
*  Industry standard and I think it's because industry doesn't want people to know that it can be done on its own [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10313.84s)]
*  Why would they promote it? Just look at man? I don't know broke rapper [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10320.0s)]

*  Um, really we can walk there it it's like [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10362.08s)]

*  And paid for and I was back in Miami and like [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10400.04s)]
*  And is this an example of how like the record labels are extracting the majority of money from the artists [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10406.84s)]
*  Like when you go to Houston, you see the artists that are owning large percentages of their catalog. They're making [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10414.36s)]
*  Man fat pat [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10421.400000000001s)]
*  Hawk before he passed [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10423.76s)]

*  K Reno I can name multiple rappers who just good like they like man [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10429.6s)]
*  We good right like it is a profession there where it feels like outside of and it's not just Houston [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10435.2s)]
*  And I think that like there are other areas that has popped up as well [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10442.380000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like there's the most wealth that has been concentrated in that like area of independent artists at least but [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10445.460000000001s)]
*  Okay, so here's a question [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10453.58s)]
*  Drake has had this like perceived connectivity to Houston and I think it's because of that's cuz of jazz [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10456.06s)]
*  because the yeah jazz is a son, right a prince on yeah, and [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10462.58s)]
*  He seems to really like lean into Houston and have this it seems genuine again [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10467.42s)]
*  I'm an outsider. I don't know this appreciation of Houston. Is that a business deal or is that like a real connection and affinity to those artists like [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10472.1s)]
*  Does Houston really embrace and welcome Drake in that way and you don't have to give me like a fucking hot take or this [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10480.9s)]
*  I'm just trying to ask from outside [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10488.62s)]

*  They just send their own bubble a lot of times when it comes to outside industry. So when Drake thing I [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10629.78s)]
*  Know that he was getting embraced because of affiliation, right? [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10638.58s)]
*  Not earned [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10643.18s)]
*  Not earned, you know nothing really earned [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10645.34s)]
*  So but you can go to any other city and do that same thing by affiliation, right? [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10649.34s)]
*  But you got people like Luda [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10654.86s)]
*  That they actually have a real affection. Oh really even though looters from Atlanta [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10658.54s)]
*  Yeah, but he's just embracing love than Houston. Yeah, he's embraced cuz he put time in there [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10664.26s)]
*  You know with certain artists [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10672.5s)]
*  Everybody when you get embraced you gotta be like I'm gonna tell you embrace JJ. Fair. Oh, not um, Jazzy Fay [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10675.06s)]
*  That's for people who fucking love jazz. Hey [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10681.98s)]
*  It was and that's that's a real thing without what our R&B artists [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10684.46s)]
*  You know [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10690.18s)]
*  We have a lot of different genres for me. Most people don't even know Travis Scott from Houston [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10691.5s)]
*  I think that he's reached such superstardom that he's just known as like American musician [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10697.5s)]
*  But you guys are like, nah, this is Houston [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10703.98s)]
*  Hey, cuz we get this created for the artists that we do put out that's it for the second they leave it's like [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10706.58s)]
*  We know that Beyonce is from [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10713.539999999999s)]
*  Houston, but I don't know if she's thought of as Houston, but that's crazy cuz she's definitely yeah [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10716.74s)]
*  Represents Houston. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. She's so Houston you lose your identity as [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10723.16s)]
*  Being from Houston the more popular you get even if you don't want that [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10729.439999999999s)]
*  Like the rest of the world takes you on ask you a question is Jay-Z embraced [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10734.119999999999s)]
*  In New York like that, of course. Yeah, I mean, yeah, this is is it of course [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10739.88s)]
*  So it's just by industry people or they people no, no, no, I would even go so far as to [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10743.64s)]
*  Love I don't even know if I don't even know if Jay's embrace outside in New York [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10748.72s)]
*  I would say that that's kind of a hot take but like where we put him [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10754.119999999999s)]
*  Like I don't know if they tend he had no idea about Diddy. It's like really crazy [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10758.84s)]
*  Like in our minds he's a stadium act in all countries around the world [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10767.2s)]
*  I don't know if if he is that but in our minds he is is that fair saving the world? [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10771.68s)]
*  Away from the act. I'm talking about be loved. Oh, he's [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10778.28s)]
*  It's it's yeah good in any hood [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10782.84s)]
*  He can yeah, yeah, like for us like walker. No, I don't think y'all really understand what I'm talking about [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10785.68s)]
*  Oh, what do you come out Muhammad Ali embraced? [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10791.48s)]
*  With no fucking security with no none of that shit. You just what you just outside. Yeah, like I'm outside [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10794.44s)]
*  He doesn't do that, but he could but he can't I think he's got that much in New York. Yeah, absolutely [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10800.52s)]
*  Okay, as an outsider the way they love him is like, yeah, yeah, it's I think for us it's like I'm a Texas kid [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10806.6s)]
*  Jay-z is is [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10812.68s)]
*  Like so there's two different things. It's like [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10814.6s)]
*  Again, I you know, I'm curious your perspective too [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10817.84s)]
*  But it's like who do I want to hang out and kick it with as far as like New York goes rappers goes [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10820.16s)]
*  It's like 50. I want to just if I'm going to party if I'm gonna hang out for watching [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10824.8s)]
*  I just want you know 50 is just gonna make everything hilarious and he's gonna say wild jokes is gonna be [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10829.68s)]
*  He's the goat right and and then there's Jay-z who is like, oh [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10835.64s)]
*  this is the the [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10841.56s)]
*  businessman tycoon [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10843.64s)]
*  so I think that there's a lot of inspiration which is almost like unfair for 50 in terms of like what he's achieved in his [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10844.76s)]
*  career as well like but I think you look at these two people and [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10850.039999999999s)]
*  Despite obviously some you know [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10854.88s)]
*  Rough stuff that's going on in hip-hop or at least in like gang life [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10857.44s)]
*  50 said could go wherever the fuck he wants Jay-z could go wherever the fuck he wants and they're just [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10862.039999999999s)]
*  Mount Rushmore in New York City. There's two there's not four. There's two and which is which is crazy cuz [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10866.92s)]
*  Biggie rest in peace. I'm talking about alive. Y'all y'all have put these y'all put those two rappers on [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10874.039999999999s)]
*  Mount Rushmore and forget about all the rest of them. Nobody is above Rock Hill [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10881.08s)]
*  Not neither one you're talking about a generational thing right now and I think that like older heads will look at a rock him and they'll be [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10888.24s)]
*  like [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10894.359999999999s)]
*  This is you know, the greatest rapper we produce. I think the younger people don't they're not as familiar with a rock him [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10895.199999999999s)]
*  And also another thing with New York. Yeah something that's different from New York compared to Houston [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10902.84s)]
*  It sounds like we have the crabs in the barrel mentality like you know [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10909.119999999999s)]
*  It could only be one you choose your guy and now you gotta go hard for your guy instead of just embracing everybody and loving everybody [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10912.56s)]
*  And they even [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10918.68s)]
*  Did and I'll be like yo y'all losing your goddamn mind again [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10920.68s)]
*  This is like dumb generational shit where it's like dead I think that doesn't go Russell type shit this competitive nature [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10926.08s)]
*  Don't appreciate it [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10936.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10938.480000000001s)]
*  Just cuz you didn't see it doesn't mean that it didn't set the fourth the foundation for what you doing now truth [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10941.36s)]
*  Yes, but they don't know [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10948.62s)]
*  You're absolutely right. You know why they don't know because y'all are [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10950.800000000001s)]
*  Not teaching them [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10955.24s)]
*  No, Charlamagne says this exact same shit. He's like we're not celebrating the people who have laid the foundation [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10958.640000000001s)]
*  We're not celebrating the OGs enough. There's this like immediate reaction to like what is hot and new now instead of embracing the legends music in particular [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10964.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're driven. Whereas it does feel like in Houston. There's still an embracing of the legends, but I also think they keep putting out music [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10972.24s)]
*  It's like these guys [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10980.08s)]
*  Long time they go they go say screw in every song. Yeah [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10984.08s)]
*  Because it's in pimp and I am bond [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10987.92s)]
*  I didn't even mention bond bond on a whole other level. Yeah, but it's just man [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10990.82s)]
*  But it's a cultural mentality thing because over there you guys all get along like we our major [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10997.14s)]
*  Artist he used to beef with each other. So how you gonna root for the guy who's beefing with my guy? [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11003.5s)]
*  We've beef with each other before too. We just never let y'all in on the beat [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11008.38s)]
*  There's also another things and that's [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11016.02s)]
*  You got a flight but [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11020.86s)]
*  But like there's one little thing that I would also say is that there are so many people that move into New York and a lot [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11023.1s)]
*  Of New Yorkers that grow up here end up moving out [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11029.66s)]
*  So there is this kind of like refresh of New Yorkers every 20 years [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11032.14s)]
*  So a lot of these new people that moved in from all these other places [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11037.42s)]
*  They don't remember going to the tunnel and seeing these artists [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11040.92s)]
*  Yeah, right [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11044.66s)]
*  So they just have no connectivity to it the OGs that are like staying here tell the stories about it [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11045.38s)]
*  But then the young people like I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't lived that way [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11051.22s)]
*  Yeah, so because of that kind of like every friend I have from Houston move back. It's crazy. Yeah every friend move back [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11054.38s)]
*  I do think that plays a little bit. Would you come home? [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11061.38s)]
*  I'm never going back to Dallas to live [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11065.66s)]
*  Go check out rugby go check out I think you got to check out parts one through four [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11075.939999999999s)]
*  There's tons it's gonna be in your algorithm and you're gonna enjoy it we wish you much success my man [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11082.099999999999s)]
*  And I definitely see it in the future when we doing the tour together [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11087.14s)]
