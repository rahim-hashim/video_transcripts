*  Wow. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=118.72s)]
*  Three digits. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=119.72s)]
*  How's dick game? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=120.72s)]
*  Man, crazy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=121.72s)]
*  It's coming back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=122.72s)]
*  Now listen, me and my wife just had this conversation because I've struggled with my weight my whole [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=123.72s)]
*  life and she's seen me get really big and seen me lose weight before. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=130.16s)]
*  So I was like, yo, am I tripping or is it not? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=133.28s)]
*  It was a lot faster last time as far as even losing the weight and getting the dick back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=136.68s)]
*  So I was like, am I tripping? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=140.76s)]
*  And she's like, listen, my wife is the most honest human on earth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=142.16s)]
*  She goes, daddy, you're a little older now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=145.4s)]
*  We might have to just get that thing cut off because I'm like a kangaroo with a pouch above [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=148.84s)]
*  my pecker. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=152.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=153.76s)]
*  The pouch goes back, the pecker comes out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=154.76s)]
*  So I found myself in this juxtaposition where I'm losing the weight here, but the pouch [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=157.6s)]
*  is still pouching. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=162.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=163.4s)]
*  Yeah, I got to look exactly. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=164.4s)]
*  Oh, that's fire. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=165.4s)]
*  No, it's not fire. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=166.4s)]
*  No, that's fire. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=167.4s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=168.4s)]
*  Because it didn't warm always. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=169.4s)]
*  You know what I love about y'all? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=170.4s)]
*  It's my big album. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=171.4s)]
*  That's how we started. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=172.4s)]
*  We're talking about the album. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=173.4s)]
*  We're talking about these podcasts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  It's like a dick pillow. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Good to see y'all again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  I like this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  I like this that you have that nice little area. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Because you got to make her work for it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm making you want it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  It's like a hand warmer for a quarterback. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  This is on you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  This is now on you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  No, I feel good though, man. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm losing weight. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  I was telling you, that's why we quit talking about it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm hitting that moment where you start to hit a stride in it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  In weight loss or just in life? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  In everything. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  Like just the clarity of the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm hitting that moment where you start to hit a stride in it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  In weight loss or just in life? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  In everything. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Just the clarity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=203.56s)]
*  The clarity is coming with the weight loss, the music, the writing, the tour, the production. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=204.56s)]
*  But even down to my discipline of like, I don't want to say I've overcome it, but dude, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=211.06s)]
*  I haven't ate anything. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=216.6s)]
*  It's been so long. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=218.2s)]
*  I don't even think about it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=219.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=220.2s)]
*  I just thought about this the other day, that I've been such an obese human and fought food [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=221.2s)]
*  addiction so long, Andrew, that I would walk into rooms and make assessments of what was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  in there that I could snack on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  Like Jason Bourne. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=231.28s)]
*  I'd be like on some super fat shit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=233.08s)]
*  I'd be like, yo, there's a can of Snickers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=235.08s)]
*  I got a little bowl here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=237.08s)]
*  There's a can of Snickers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=238.08s)]
*  There's a lot of Snickers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=239.08s)]
*  You know how to be having the cans with the little baby Snickers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=240.08s)]
*  Don't you guys like to see them? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=243.08s)]
*  Baby Snickers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=245.08s)]
*  I like that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=246.08s)]
*  I like that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=247.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=248.08s)]
*  You can take it outside the box. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=249.08s)]
*  Yeah, and now it's like, man, I'm in the dressing room the other day and there was a, I don't, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=250.08s)]
*  I didn't even notice the candy in the dressing room until somebody said, do you want one of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=254.08s)]
*  these? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=258.08s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not even thinking like that no more. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=259.08s)]
*  I remember when I caught that with drugs. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=262.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=266.08s)]
*  Like the first time that I found myself in an environment where people were doing cocaine [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=267.08s)]
*  and I wasn't like, gotta get out of the room. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=270.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=272.88s)]
*  I was just like, oh yeah, I used to do that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=273.88s)]
*  That was all right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=274.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=275.88s)]
*  We had a lot of fun. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=276.88s)]
*  You struggle with drugs, like you said. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=277.88s)]
*  My family, we have a lot of addiction, but like I noticed my dad. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=278.88s)]
*  No, that's pleasure. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=282.88s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=285.88s)]
*  Addiction's not fun. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=288.68s)]
*  It destroys families. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=289.68s)]
*  But no, I noticed like my brother stopped drinking, my dad stopped drinking and went [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=290.68s)]

*  even higher. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=570.48s)]
*  It goes down and go up. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=571.48s)]
*  It's how it works. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=572.48s)]

*  We've got to get Billy Crudup off the stage. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=575.48s)]
*  We've got to get Billy Crudup off the stage. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=576.48s)]
*  We've got to get Billy Crudup off the stage. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=577.48s)]
*  I keep looking at it like, I don't even remember what he was in. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=585.48s)]
*  No, but I came in and I was like, look, man, we do give away a lot of money. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=588.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=592.48s)]
*  And I was like, I do need somebody to help me. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=593.48s)]
*  I don't have, I can't, man, I feel so bougie saying this. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=595.48s)]
*  No, because it's- [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=598.48s)]
*  But y'all are late because this is just real life. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=599.48s)]
*  This is how I would talk if we went on a pod. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=600.48s)]
*  I just have too much incoming to give anything the proper time it deserves almost. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=602.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=607.48s)]
*  Like in any- [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=608.48s)]
*  Yeah, you've been through this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=609.48s)]
*  But when I know that I feel like it's been on my heart that I need to- [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=610.48s)]
*  Give back. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=612.48s)]
*  So he's so cool. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=613.48s)]
*  He's got such a big infrastructure for his other business. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=614.48s)]
*  He'll just put his people on it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=616.48s)]
*  Like, you know, we all go find, this is what he wants to do. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=617.48s)]
*  He wants to do this amount of soup kitchens, this amount of juvenile facilities. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=619.48s)]
*  And now it's caused a chain reaction where when I go to venues now, you know how venues [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=623.48s)]
*  give us our gifts when we play these arenas? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=627.48s)]
*  You've been doing them longer than me. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=628.48s)]
*  We get gifts. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=629.48s)]
*  They give you jerseys and a box and all kinds of stuff. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=630.48s)]
*  Everyone tries to give you something cooler in the last arena. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=632.48s)]
*  That's the coolest shit ever. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=634.48s)]
*  But now they'll always all donate a check to a charity in that city in like honor of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=635.48s)]
*  what they know I stand for. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=642.48s)]
*  But you still get the jersey, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=643.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'll still get the jersey. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=644.48s)]
*  Don't give it to them kids. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=645.48s)]
*  The boss himself, he told me hold the thing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=646.48s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=647.48s)]
*  I'm sick. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=648.48s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=649.48s)]
*  They got like 18 of them. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=650.48s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=651.48s)]
*  I stood over and took pictures for like three minutes before they were like, you can touch [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=652.48s)]
*  it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=659.48s)]
*  I was like, I wish I would have been finger fucking this thing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=660.48s)]
*  All that three minutes. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=661.48s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=662.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=663.48s)]
*  So now it's become a thing where, you know, so yeah, I have a guy that really is a great [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=664.48s)]
*  guy, man. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=669.48s)]
*  So what else with that? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=670.48s)]
*  I want to help many people. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=672.48s)]
*  I mean, you're a great guy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=673.48s)]
*  You're the great connector I've realized because you have this song. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=674.48s)]
*  Oh, that was it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=678.48s)]
*  You also did Fallon. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=679.48s)]
*  We were watching Fallon that night. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=680.48s)]
*  I can't believe I left out one of the things that was part of that weekend as well. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=681.48s)]
*  So you and MGK do Fallon. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=684.48s)]
*  MGK is hanging out with you. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=686.48s)]
*  Also, great guy. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=688.48s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=689.48s)]
*  That's why I'm bringing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=690.48s)]
*  That's why I'm taking this. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=691.48s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=692.48s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=693.48s)]
*  We had this moment where he was like, yeah, I don't understand. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=694.48s)]
*  Why don't people think that I'm like a nice guy sometimes? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=696.48s)]
*  And I'm like, well, let's look at the outfits a little. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=698.48s)]
*  And I remember he like looked at some of these. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=700.48s)]
*  Okay, I get that one. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=703.48s)]
*  He was wearing like a pink furry shirt. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=704.48s)]
*  He's like, yeah, that one I get. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=706.48s)]
*  He's like, I like wearing stupid shit, but that was a little far. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=707.48s)]
*  That was the best because he'd go, I stand on that one. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=709.48s)]
*  But yeah, that one was horrible. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=711.48s)]
*  It was so funny to watch you and you'll have that moment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=713.48s)]
*  No, he was a great dude. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=715.48s)]
*  And that is what often happens, I think, in this business is that you might have a perception [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=717.48s)]
*  of people and then you get to a point where you start meeting them and you're like, a [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=720.48s)]
*  lot of times surprised at them being like really nice people and like sweet people. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=724.48s)]
*  All right, Cucks, let's do some dates. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=729.48s)]
*  January 9th through 11th. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=731.48s)]
*  I don't know why they gave me those dates, to be honest with you, now that I think about it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=733.48s)]
*  ScySplitters in Tampa. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=736.48s)]
*  I feel a little way about that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=737.48s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=738.48s)]
*  January 23rd to 25th, Sacramento, those tickets will sell out. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=739.48s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=742.48s)]
*  They sold out two years ago and I wasn't even really selling tickets back then. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=743.48s)]
*  January 31st through February 1st, West Des Moines, Iowa. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=746.48s)]
*  Again, I cannot believe there's an East Des Moines. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=751.48s)]
*  But West Des Moines, Iowa, I'm going to be at the funny bone. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=753.48s)]
*  February 21st and 22nd, I'm going to be in Brayette, California. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=755.48s)]
*  You know you guys love me. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=758.48s)]
*  February 28th through March 1st, I'm going to be in Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=759.48s)]
*  We got more dates coming. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=763.48s)]
*  I think I'm going to be in San Diego one of those times as well. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=764.48s)]
*  Either way, guys, come through. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=767.48s)]
*  Love y'all. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=768.48s)]
*  AkashSingh.com for tickets. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=769.48s)]
*  Thank you so fucking much. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=770.48s)]
*  This year was awesome. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=771.48s)]
*  Sold out, I think, shows for six months straight. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=772.48s)]
*  This weekend, I had the first show I didn't sell out. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=775.48s)]
*  But still such a fucking awesome year. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=777.48s)]
*  Love you guys. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=779.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=780.48s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=781.48s)]
*  The interesting thing about that is you're with MGK. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=782.48s)]
*  You have a song with MGK. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=784.48s)]
*  You also have a song with Eminem. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=786.48s)]
*  These guys are mortal enemies. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=789.48s)]
*  And somehow you are so talented that you are positioned in between both of them. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=791.48s)]
*  And they're like, I still want to work with Jelly Roll. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=796.48s)]
*  How do you manage that? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=798.48s)]
*  Man, the first thing is honesty. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=800.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=802.48s)]
*  Right. You got to come into both parties honest. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=803.48s)]
*  How do you talk to Em? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=805.48s)]
*  Well, so Paul is, and I always bring up Paul in interviews because I feel like he never gets brought up enough. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=806.48s)]
*  Paul Rosenberg. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=812.48s)]
*  Paul Rosenberg has been Eminem's manager since Eminem's had a manager. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=813.48s)]
*  Lifelong Detroit homie kind of shit. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=816.48s)]
*  Like really cool inception story. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=819.48s)]
*  Cool story about Eminem is his, I believe his publicist, his assistant who kind of runs the record label. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=821.48s)]
*  I don't want to call her assistant because she's so much more. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=829.48s)]
*  But he's had like the same four people around him for his whole career. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=831.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=835.48s)]
*  Entire career. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=836.48s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=837.48s)]
*  So you don't really talk to, you know, he's the wizard, man. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=838.48s)]
*  He's the biggest artist of our generation. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=841.48s)]
*  He sold more records than Elvis. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=843.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=845.48s)]
*  I mean, it's insane when you think about how big, you know, you don't really get to see the wizard a lot. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=846.48s)]
*  But I've seen the wizard now and hung out with him and he's a fucking great guy. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=851.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=854.48s)]
*  He's really down to earth. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=855.48s)]
*  He's super honest and he's very intentional with his words. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=856.48s)]
*  I mean, we hung out on video set for 12 hours. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=859.48s)]
*  Just like dicking around to show you his personality. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=862.48s)]
*  He walks in my green room going, somebody shave me. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=865.48s)]
*  I need some gel. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=869.48s)]
*  He said, we can get you a deal there. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=870.48s)]
*  And just fucking fun. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=872.48s)]
*  So that's the first interaction you have. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=874.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=876.48s)]
*  The first one we have is when we're singing. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=877.48s)]
*  I'll tell you that story too. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=878.48s)]
*  But just let me praise Paul for two more minutes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=879.48s)]
*  He deserves it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=881.48s)]
*  Paul has always been trying to get me and him together. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=882.48s)]
*  Like every time I've seen Paul, he's like, if Marshall don't understand anybody else, he's going to be like, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=885.48s)]
*  If you don't understand anybody else, he's going to get you. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=891.48s)]
*  When he gets you, he's going to get you. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=893.48s)]
*  And he's telling me this for like since I met him when he was working with Yellow Wolf a decade ago. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=895.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=899.48s)]
*  So like Paul has been that champion for me the whole way. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=900.48s)]
*  So Paul calls and he's like, send me to save me record. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=903.48s)]
*  And I'm like, y'all mind if I tell this story first? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=908.48s)]
*  Because it's hard to get into the audience. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=910.48s)]
*  Because I don't think I've told this one like this. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=912.48s)]
*  So Paul calls and he's like, send the stems to the save me record. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=914.48s)]
*  He calls John Manili, my manager. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=917.48s)]
*  Now keep in mind, John Manili managed Jay for a while. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=918.48s)]
*  So they've already worked. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=920.48s)]
*  They have a real, they're friends for real for 30 years now. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=922.48s)]
*  They've been in the business together for 25 years. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=925.48s)]
*  So he hits, he hits John Manili. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=928.48s)]
*  He's like, yo, send over save me. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=930.48s)]
*  I think Marshall wants to fuck with it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=932.48s)]
*  And that's all he said. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=934.48s)]
*  So, you know, me, I'm like, you know how rap works. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=935.48s)]
*  I'm like, I'm fixing to get an Eminem remix. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=938.48s)]
*  Like he's just going to drop a verse in my lap one day. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=940.48s)]
*  Like I don't know when and I don't care. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=943.48s)]
*  Whenever it comes, just thank you God, you know? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=945.48s)]
*  And I had already told Kels that story back then. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=947.48s)]
*  And Kels is a real friend. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=951.48s)]
*  You know where Kels is just like, yo, that's huge. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=953.48s)]
*  Keep me posted. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=956.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=958.48s)]
*  Like he's cheering for me. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=959.48s)]
*  Like at heart, his heart is like, you know what I mean? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=960.48s)]
*  Like, yo man, that's, I can't, you don't have a problem. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=963.48s)]
*  Kels being MGK. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=965.48s)]
*  Sorry, Kels being MGK. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=966.48s)]
*  He's like, yo, you don't have a problem. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=967.48s)]
*  So this is like, I probably shouldn't town stamp it too much, but this is 18 months ago. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=969.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=973.48s)]
*  So I get to the point, I don't think it's coming. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=974.48s)]
*  I'm kind of just like, it didn't happen. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=976.48s)]
*  It's whatever, you know, it works. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=978.48s)]
*  And then I get the call. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=979.48s)]
*  It's like, yo, what's going on the record? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=980.48s)]
*  It's closing the record. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=981.48s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=982.48s)]
*  Second single, they want to shoot a video. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=983.48s)]
*  Now keep in mind, me and Kels are, we hung out at the Grammys. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=986.48s)]
*  We had both lost and we ended up on what we call the loser tour that night. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=990.48s)]
*  We went to all these like weird, crazy, like Illuminati parties. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=993.48s)]
*  It felt like it was so fucking weird, dude. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=998.48s)]
*  And we went to like three or four. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1000.48s)]
*  Baby oil basses. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1002.48s)]
*  No, no, no baby oil basses. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1003.48s)]
*  But I went in, we went to all these weird parties and he had played me the idea for [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1006.48s)]
*  Lonely Road that night. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1010.48s)]
*  So this is, you know, three, four months after me and Kels have already worked on two or [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1012.48s)]
*  three records together. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1015.48s)]
*  We're hanging out every day. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1016.48s)]
*  I'm in LA a bunch. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1017.48s)]
*  I don't have a friend out there. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1018.48s)]
*  I only know him. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1019.48s)]
*  It's like, still, you talk about when I pull up on you, Bubba, you're my only friend here. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1020.48s)]
*  What do you mean I'm going to pull up on you? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1024.48s)]
*  I don't know nobody. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1026.48s)]
*  You're my only friend. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1027.48s)]
*  Well, that makes me feel less special. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1030.48s)]
*  No, no. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1032.48s)]
*  I'm in like, I love you. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1033.48s)]
*  I'm looking for my Bubba. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1034.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1035.48s)]
*  So me and him are hanging every day and I'm like, yo, this Eminem thing's real. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1037.48s)]
*  I was like, it's fixing to come out and they want to do all this. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1042.48s)]
*  Now we're already in there. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1046.48s)]
*  Now on the other side, John's having to do straight business with Paul. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1047.48s)]
*  Like, hey, Paul, you know Kels and Jelly have known each other for 15 years on and off. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1050.48s)]
*  They were beefing, Jelly dissed him. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1054.48s)]
*  I was a hater back then. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1056.48s)]
*  It's a whole other fun story. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1057.48s)]
*  But they're buddies. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1059.48s)]
*  And here's where Paul's a good dude too. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1060.48s)]
*  Paul's like, yo, man, we love Jelly, man. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1062.48s)]
*  Appreciate you telling us. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1064.48s)]
*  Never got brought up. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1065.48s)]
*  My heart is always to bring them together one day because I see so much more of them in each other than they know. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1067.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1075.48s)]
*  I hadn't really brought it up to Marshall yet because I'm just still kind of glad that I'm still in that circumference to be able to have them conversations. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1076.48s)]
*  But I do see like there's so much more in them than not. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1083.48s)]
*  But like I also gave Kels some perspective too was like we all grew up watching Eminem take over the game early. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1086.48s)]
*  Like if you got mentioned in an Eminem song, it was like getting mentioned in a comedy special. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1092.48s)]
*  You were on fucking fire. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1097.48s)]
*  You couldn't be hotter if you got mentioned in an Eminem special or an HBO special. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1099.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1104.48s)]
*  An Eminem song or an HBO special is what you wanted your name to be brought up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1105.48s)]
*  I don't think that that beef between MGK and Eminem like that verse from MGK was I think the most underrated. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1108.48s)]
*  Actually, I thought it was rated. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1116.48s)]
*  Like I think most people looked at that and they were like, whoa, this was way better than I thought. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1118.48s)]
*  And then I think Eminem's verse, I don't think people thought that he absolutely knocked him out the park. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1122.48s)]
*  Like I thought that the reaction to it was this is more competitive than we thought it was going to be. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1128.48s)]
*  So I think that MGK's respect went up. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1134.48s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is over time, it's changed. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1136.48s)]
*  And the moment I remember that being the response and now people look back on it, they're like, oh, Eminem ended MGK's rap career because MGK transitioned and other stuff. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1138.48s)]
*  And so I think the narrative got written, rewritten that way. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1146.48s)]
*  Well, I remember in the moment people being like, yo, I don't think MGK necessarily got destroyed. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1149.48s)]
*  But the only thing I'll say to touch on this because I'm a slippery slope. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1154.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, just not. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1157.48s)]
*  Everything Andrew just said right now, I want the flagrant listeners to know he said to MGK, I watch y'all have the same conversation, which I think is super cool. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1161.48s)]
*  But here's how I feel. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1170.48s)]
*  Look, man, they're going to get together one day eventually. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1172.48s)]
*  It's inevitable. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1175.48s)]
*  The world's a circle. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1176.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1177.48s)]
*  And I think that they're going to find each other's heart more than they don't. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1178.48s)]
*  And if they never do connect that way, I think that it did more for both of them than it did to hurt either one of them. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1180.48s)]
*  I don't think my brother, either party ever fully acknowledged that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1186.48s)]
*  What MGK did after that, I don't think had anything to do with the beef as much as his heart and what his spirit was. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1189.48s)]
*  Because he technically dropped, I think Hotel Diablo was the project right after the end beef. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1196.48s)]
*  Don't quote me. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1201.48s)]
*  But it was the two. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1202.48s)]
*  It was the mainstream sellout and it was the tickets to my downfall that changed. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1203.48s)]
*  I'm talking about a couple of the biggest out. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1208.48s)]
*  They'll go down as the biggest albums of this generation and pop and pop punk and punk rock and maybe in rock and roll like new music from new recording artists in 10 years of rock music. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1210.48s)]
*  I think those albums will be the biggest selling. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1221.48s)]
*  So that's the thing that like that was it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1223.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, I told him this shit too. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1226.48s)]
*  What I saw is him as a rapper knew him as a rapper. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1228.48s)]
*  Then I saw him become an arena acts rock star. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1232.48s)]
*  And I knew that I was getting old because I was like, what is happening? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1237.48s)]
*  What happened? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1242.48s)]
*  Did you feel that way as well? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1243.48s)]
*  I didn't know when the switch happened. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1245.48s)]
*  But he went to arenas. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1247.48s)]
*  And so something must have been resonating with the rock music on a different level than rap. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1249.48s)]
*  I also think it's hard to be like an arena rap star. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1254.48s)]
*  Like how many arena rap acts are there? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1258.48s)]
*  You know, we were talking about this before. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1260.48s)]
*  It's like stadium. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1262.48s)]
*  Stadiums for sure. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1264.48s)]
*  M&M Stadiums. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1265.48s)]
*  But like arenas around like Drake. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1266.48s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1268.48s)]
*  Let's go step deeper. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1269.48s)]
*  M&M's a plus one at most stadiums. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1270.48s)]
*  So he can do two stadium shows. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1272.48s)]
*  He's a plus one at most stadiums in America. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1275.48s)]
*  That's great. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1277.48s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, that's that's like Taylor Swift shit. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1278.48s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1280.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1282.48s)]
*  And then there's Taylor of Rage. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1283.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1284.48s)]
*  Yeah, even now to this day. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1285.48s)]
*  Like crazy. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1286.48s)]
*  But it's like what are the arena acts? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1287.48s)]
*  It's like Kendrick. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1288.48s)]
*  Kendrick. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1289.48s)]
*  Nikki. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1290.48s)]
*  I think Nikki's built like this unbelievable following. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1291.48s)]
*  Nikki did arenas. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1292.48s)]
*  She came to Nashville and sold out on the winter. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1293.48s)]
*  Travis Scott. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1294.48s)]
*  Travis. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1295.48s)]
*  Travis. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1296.48s)]
*  Who is Megan and Glo? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1297.48s)]
*  Is it a Megan and Glo the package right now? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1298.48s)]
*  Because they're doing arenas right now. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1299.48s)]
*  Megan and Glo together are doing arenas right now. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1300.48s)]
*  But that's still packaged. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1301.48s)]
*  Like I'm curious. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1302.48s)]
*  And maybe Megan is big enough. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1303.48s)]
*  Glo really is red hot. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1304.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1305.48s)]
*  I fucking love everything. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1306.48s)]
*  She is great. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1307.48s)]
*  She is so good. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1308.48s)]
*  She's so good. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1309.48s)]
*  I fucking love everything. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1310.48s)]
*  She is great. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1311.48s)]
*  She is so Memphis. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1312.48s)]
*  She's the best human ever. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1313.48s)]
*  Like when I met her, she was, I was like, I grew up going back and forth to Memphis my [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1314.48s)]
*  whole life, like coming up under three, six mafia. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1319.48s)]
*  I was like, please let her be as Memphis as it looks. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1321.48s)]
*  Like off camera, let it be as Memphis as it looks. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1324.48s)]
*  Oh, she is so Memphis. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1326.48s)]
*  She is, it's like talking to Project Pat. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1328.48s)]
*  It is awesome, dude. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1331.48s)]
*  It is incredible how Memphis she is. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1333.48s)]
*  But they're doing, they're full blown arenas now. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1335.48s)]
*  Now that can't. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1337.48s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1338.48s)]
*  I love that rap space. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1339.48s)]
*  Say again? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1340.48s)]
*  I hate to use that phrase, but like who from that space? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1341.48s)]
*  Suicide boys are doing an arena tour right now. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1343.48s)]
*  Whether you acknowledge them as rappers or not, I think they're sick as shit. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1345.48s)]
*  I love the Suicide boys. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1348.48s)]
*  I know they're doing arenas because we're on their ass every night. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1349.48s)]
*  They're playing Tuesdays and Thursdays like us. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1353.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1355.48s)]
*  And they're selling almost clean everywhere they're going. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1356.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1358.48s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1359.48s)]
*  It's just a rare thing. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1360.48s)]
*  It's like, especially in a rap space, it's rarefied air. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1361.48s)]
*  It's listened to as rap music is. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1364.48s)]
*  When they did the West Coast package, I remember they did like the, whatever they labeled the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1367.48s)]
*  West Coast package, it had Cube. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1371.48s)]
*  Oh, I mean, when 50 went back out. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1373.48s)]
*  50 went out and did it. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1376.48s)]
*  He was doing it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1377.48s)]
*  But then again, you got one of the biggest rappers ever. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1378.48s)]
*  It's like Kanye. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1381.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1382.48s)]
*  It's just a hard thing for rappers to do. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1383.48s)]
*  For whatever reason, for as much as we listen to rap, as popular as rappers are, as like [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1386.48s)]
*  seen and noticed and recognized, it doesn't translate to ticket sales in the way that like [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1391.48s)]
*  country does definitely doesn't as rock. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1396.48s)]
*  EDM, you could argue, is like overindexed. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1398.48s)]
*  There are EDM DJs that I have no fucking clue their name. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1401.48s)]
*  There's an EDM DJ named Anima that is doing the Sphere in Las Vegas and they've added [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1404.48s)]
*  shows. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1412.48s)]
*  So now they're at like six or seven shows or something like that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1413.48s)]
*  Four New Year's Eve plus others. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1415.48s)]
*  Did you guys know who this guy was? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1417.48s)]
*  I mean, no disrespect to him. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1419.48s)]
*  I did. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1420.48s)]
*  You guys did it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1421.48s)]
*  You did. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1422.48s)]
*  Do you know Fred again? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1423.48s)]
*  That guy's fucking massive. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1424.48s)]
*  Fred again was on our new artist Grammy list this year. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1425.48s)]
*  That's how I kind of got hip to him. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1429.48s)]
*  And I was joking with Noah about it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1431.48s)]
*  We were joking about all the, you know, who all we were, me, Noah, and I think Gracie Abrams [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1433.48s)]
*  were all talking at the table. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1437.48s)]
*  And I said, the funny part of this is I don't even think Fred again came to the Grammys, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1438.48s)]
*  by the way. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1441.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1442.48s)]
*  I don't think he even showed up. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1443.48s)]
*  But if he did, I didn't get to meet him. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1444.48s)]
*  And he's going to make more money than all of us put together when it's all said. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1445.48s)]
*  He's doing crazy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1448.48s)]
*  He's doing a stadium show where he'll like have a B stage in like the nosebleeds. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1449.48s)]
*  They did a wild thing. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1454.48s)]
*  They did a. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1456.48s)]
*  OK, I'm going to fuck this up probably. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1457.48s)]
*  But with MSG, what they wanted to do is go on sale the day before the show. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1460.48s)]
*  So they wanted 24 hour notice. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1465.48s)]
*  And I think that they couldn't because of like a ticketmaster regulate some stuff like that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1467.48s)]
*  So then maybe it was like a few days. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1471.48s)]
*  They sell it out immediately and then they do the show. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1473.48s)]
*  And then for the show, I'm going to butcher this and somebody will fucking correct me. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1475.48s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1479.48s)]
*  They keep the lights on. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1480.48s)]
*  I think they start the show at like in the afternoon and they keep the lights on until it's eight or ten or whatever it is. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1481.48s)]
*  And that moment, the lights switch and just imagine the energy building, building, building and then no lights off. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1488.48s)]
*  He treated the MSG like it was a club because it wasn't even like the normal end stage. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1495.48s)]
*  This was like it makes in the room. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1500.48s)]
*  And then he did with Skrillex. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1502.48s)]
*  OK, OK, OK. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1504.48s)]
*  Because I think we spoke to his manager when we were in Vegas. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1505.48s)]
*  Anyway, what a creative idea. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1509.48s)]
*  Yeah, but he did one where he was at. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1512.48s)]
*  I think it was at the Hollywood Bowl and he got all the people that came to his very first show when he went to L.A. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1514.48s)]
*  And it was like 200, 300 people and put them in the Hollywood Bowl in one section and did a private show for those like 300 people. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1520.48s)]
*  That's fire. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1527.48s)]
*  The day before the actual arena show. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1528.48s)]
*  His L.A. Coliseum show, he created like this LED moat around the entire bowl of a stadium so that everyone had a seat. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1531.48s)]
*  And then did the B stage show. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1540.48s)]
*  He's sleeping outside the box. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1542.48s)]
*  I wonder who's doing all that production for him. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1544.48s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1546.48s)]
*  Back at you. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1547.48s)]
*  Like your show is. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1548.48s)]
*  The guys, and I want to hear your guys' reflection on your show, but everybody came to me and they're like, oh, this is amazing. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1550.48s)]
*  And there was this there was so much creativity added to it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1556.48s)]
*  But like the explosiveness was awesome. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1559.48s)]
*  And I was talking to a guy about. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1562.48s)]
*  EDM or whatever. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1565.48s)]
*  I don't know anything about EDM. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1567.48s)]
*  OK, but I was talking about EDM and he said something interesting because I asked him to play that on my guy or any mom from Pratt. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1568.48s)]
*  So right. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1575.48s)]
*  And it was like an hour long set. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1576.48s)]
*  And it started like real hard, kind of like pumping stuff. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1577.48s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know if it's mine. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1580.48s)]
*  He goes, yeah, but it's an hour long set. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1581.48s)]
*  And I go, so? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1583.48s)]
*  He goes, well, like the first 20, 30 minutes, he's just getting everybody's heart rate up to from 80 beats to like 110. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1584.48s)]
*  I go, well, so that they can do this big drop, he goes, it'd be different if he was just doing like five songs. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1593.48s)]
*  As a comedian, you think about these things, but not you're not as tied into like somebody's biochemistry is like you are with music. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1599.48s)]
*  So when you're setting up your set, are you if you have that hour and a half or two, how long is your set? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1607.48s)]
*  Ninety five minutes. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1613.48s)]
*  So 95 minutes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1614.48s)]
*  Are you considering that? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1615.48s)]
*  Are you like, OK, we're we're slowly bringing them on everybody's same page, everybody's same page, Bill, Bill. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1616.48s)]
*  Can you a little different? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1622.48s)]
*  But can you break down what you're thinking when you're creating the set? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1623.48s)]
*  Yeah, every of course, every show is different. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1626.48s)]
*  Every tour, just kind of like you with the life. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1628.48s)]
*  But for me, this particular tour, I was like, I wanted to make a real statement at the beginning of the show. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1630.48s)]
*  Like it was important to me not to like because like the trick is either you come out to like an uptempo hit that people know and then you kind of kind of play into the crowd and then you kind of bring them into the couple songs they don't know. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1638.48s)]
*  And the set slowly ramps up and slowly ramps up in the last four songs, the bangers, the biggest four songs. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1651.48s)]
*  This is like rock and roll one on one. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1656.48s)]
*  And I was like, so I've always tried to stay away from that model, like not to like give away too much of what I do. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1659.48s)]
*  But like immediately I'm like, fuck, that model sucks. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1664.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1666.48s)]
*  Like fucking even from my perspective, it's expected like and also, yeah, 100% gone. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1667.48s)]
*  So I was like, what have we come out? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1672.48s)]
*  And the first thing we do, I blow one of the biggest gags I have. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1675.48s)]
*  I mean, I walk straight into the arena and all eyes on this thing that happens. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1679.48s)]
*  Right. And I drop. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1685.48s)]
*  I'm not OK out the gate. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1686.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1688.48s)]
*  So it's the fucking first thing I'm doing. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1689.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm walking right in and like fucking balls on table. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1691.48s)]
*  And I'm doing an effect. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1695.48s)]
*  Right. I'm doing an extra thing that happens. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1698.48s)]
*  It's like even if I look right now and tell you, you know what song I'm going to do first and it's still going to have a moment in the song. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1700.48s)]
*  We're going to go get the fuck out of here. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1706.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1708.48s)]
*  And I also did that because I wanted people to go. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1709.48s)]
*  Where can you go from here? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1711.48s)]
*  That was intentional, too, because I knew once I put us in a box where whenever me and my team were talking, they're like, all right, this is the side. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1713.48s)]
*  And I was like, this is what I want to do with this. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1719.48s)]
*  I like, cool. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1721.48s)]
*  I was like, that's how I want to start the show. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1722.48s)]
*  And right then you can see them go, fuck, well, how do we finish? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1723.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1726.48s)]
*  I was like, that's how we challenge ourselves. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1727.48s)]
*  Now we got to work through it. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1729.48s)]
*  We know where we're starting. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1730.48s)]
*  And then I build the whole set like an emotional. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1731.48s)]
*  To me, it's about music. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1734.48s)]
*  The best concerts that meant the most to me were the ones I remember leaving, how they made me feel. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1738.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1742.48s)]
*  Like, I don't even remember the set list. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1743.48s)]
*  I don't fully remember what songs they sung. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1744.48s)]
*  I remember some highlights. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1746.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1747.48s)]
*  But I remember the overarching theme of how I left feeling. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1748.48s)]
*  Amen. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1752.48s)]
*  And I want people to leave this feeling free. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1753.48s)]
*  You know that feeling, I don't know if you've talked to a bunch of people from up here, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1757.48s)]
*  but don't take this wrong, but I always bring it up, that old church feeling. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1760.48s)]
*  There's something about leaving church on Sunday. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1764.48s)]
*  There's this misconception that you leave feeling like you're going to hell. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1767.48s)]
*  But if done right, you feel like that at some point in the day. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1770.48s)]
*  But you leave feeling like, I'm fucking a good guy. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1775.48s)]
*  I showed up. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1778.48s)]
*  I'm going to eat lunch with my mom now. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1779.48s)]
*  Like I'm on fire. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1782.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1784.48s)]
*  It's like, that's how I want people to leave that show feeling. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1785.48s)]
*  And I try to cater the entire set to go into that moment. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1788.48s)]
*  Because if I know that's my end game, then I just got to figure out how to get there. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1792.48s)]
*  I know how I'm starting. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1796.48s)]
*  I know how I want people to feel walking out the door. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1797.48s)]
*  How do I push them out the door? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1799.48s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1800.48s)]
*  I can attest. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1801.48s)]
*  Crisis King. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1802.48s)]
*  Finally! [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1803.48s)]
*  Get the funny camera on him! [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1805.48s)]
*  Say it again! [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1808.48s)]
*  It was spectacular. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1810.48s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1812.48s)]
*  Alright guys, Stylebender's back. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1814.48s)]
*  Yep, yep, yep, yep. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1817.48s)]
*  Big fight. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1818.48s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1819.48s)]
*  You know, this is his first non-title fight since a year after he entered the UFC. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1820.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1826.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1827.48s)]
*  How long is that? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1828.48s)]
*  I forget. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1829.48s)]
*  I saw the statistics somewhere, but this is the first non-title fight. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1830.48s)]
*  Because I think he won the UFC title, I guess, within like a year and change. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1834.48s)]
*  And then hasn't had a non-title fight. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1838.48s)]
*  Because it's either been he won or a rematch. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1841.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1844.48s)]
*  Insanity, right? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1845.48s)]
*  2019 and 2018 was the last one. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1847.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1849.48s)]
*  Imagine fighting the second best guy every single fight for years. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1850.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1855.48s)]
*  That's a long time to be the best. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1856.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1858.48s)]
*  People forget. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1859.48s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1860.48s)]
*  And I'm a prisoner at the moment or whatever, recency bias or whatever that shit is. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1861.48s)]
*  But you forget what that's like. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1865.48s)]
*  Imagine every fight you have is the Super Bowl. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1866.48s)]
*  That's what happens when you're the belt holder. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1868.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1870.48s)]
*  It's the best two. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1871.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1872.48s)]
*  Your name on the arena every time. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1873.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1874.48s)]
*  Like everyone tuning in to see you. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1875.48s)]
*  Not some like, you know, 12th game of the season where you're playing some bum ass squad [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1876.48s)]
*  where you don't have to go home every single time. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1880.48s)]
*  The titles on. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1882.48s)]
*  The titles and the guy who you're fighting has been thinking about that moment his entire [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1883.48s)]
*  adult life. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1889.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1890.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1891.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1892.48s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1893.48s)]
*  I'm actually excited to see him fight a non-title fight. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1894.48s)]
*  I'm curious to see like, is he loose? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1897.48s)]
*  Is he fucking around? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1899.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm seeing that. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1900.48s)]
*  You don't have to carry the weight of the promoter. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1901.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure he's still headlining the card, but it's not like you're not carrying [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1904.48s)]
*  this weight like you do. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1908.48s)]
*  And I just wonder what that's like. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1909.48s)]
*  I mean, I think he's like, what he said when he was here, he was like, oh yeah, I'm going [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1911.48s)]
*  to try some new stuff now. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1913.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1914.48s)]
*  Like I'm looking forward to that. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1915.48s)]
*  Like, is he going to try to tap him out? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1916.48s)]
*  Like, what's going on? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1917.48s)]
*  What are we going to see? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1918.48s)]
*  That's. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1919.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1920.48s)]
*  What do you know about Imavav? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1921.48s)]
*  I guess is again. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1922.48s)]
*  I saw Imavav fight some other dude. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1923.48s)]
*  I'm forgetting who it was, but I mean, the guy's nice if he's going to be fighting Izzy, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1926.48s)]
*  you know? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1930.48s)]
*  So, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just excited to see it. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1931.48s)]
*  Is it going to be like when you get back in the clubs after the tour? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1934.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1936.48s)]
*  You're done doing arenas and you're like, you still want to do good. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1937.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1939.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1940.48s)]
*  We can have some fun. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1941.48s)]
*  Let's have some fun. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1942.48s)]
*  Let's enjoy ourselves a little bit. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1943.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1944.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1945.48s)]
*  So yeah, that's a, that'll be, that'll be really cool. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1946.48s)]
*  And then also you got the, the, the, the Mahashev fight. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1948.48s)]
*  Makha, fuck his Mahashev. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1952.48s)]
*  Makha chef. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1954.48s)]
*  You see, you see. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1955.48s)]
*  Islam. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1956.48s)]
*  So Islam is fighting Sarukian and I don't know that much about, about, I think it's [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1957.48s)]
*  Armand Sarukian, but I noticed their second fight and apparently everybody's saying how [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1964.48s)]
*  amazing Sarukian has been and let's see what happens, but that's going to be January 18th. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1968.48s)]
*  Does Sarukian have a mustache? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1973.48s)]
*  No, but he's Christian. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1974.48s)]
*  He's from Georgia. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1977.48s)]
*  He lost. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1978.48s)]
*  Or he's Armenian, but still Christian. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1979.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1983.48s)]
*  He lost. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1984.48s)]
*  It was funny where Ariel Hawani was interviewing him and he kept saying things that were in [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1985.48s)]
*  Arabic. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1989.48s)]
*  He's like, As-salamu alaykum and all these other things. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1990.48s)]
*  And he's like, okay, I don't know. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1992.48s)]
*  I just completely lost it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=1995.48s)]
*  So, but yeah, let's see what's going on. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2000.48s)]
*  You know, we're like detached, I feel like from the rivalries in the Middle East. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2002.48s)]
*  So we don't realize the stakes, you know, when like a Georgian fighter fights a Russian [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2008.48s)]
*  fighter. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2013.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2014.2s)]
*  You know, or like an Armenian fighter fights a Turkish fight. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2015.2s)]
*  Like we just, it doesn't mean as much to us because we're not ingrained in it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2017.48s)]
*  But I imagine that's their version of like, what's a big boxing rivalry like Puerto Rico [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2021.48s)]
*  versus Mexico? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2026.48s)]
*  Floyd versus a white guy. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2027.48s)]
*  So yeah, I'm excited for these. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2029.48s)]
*  Obviously, get it popping over at stake, you know, leader in global betting and US social [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2032.48s)]
*  casinos, bet on top sports, political events, use the promo code flagrant for your welcome [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2037.48s)]
*  bonus. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2041.48s)]
*  And let's get back to the show. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2042.48s)]
*  Jelle, you've been blowing up. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2043.48s)]
*  I want to hear about all these stories. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2044.48s)]
*  I know some of the experiences you must have been having are crazy. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2046.48s)]
*  I will tell you a story about Saturday Night Live that I don't know. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2049.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2051.48s)]
*  I'm sure everybody else knew this, but me. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2052.48s)]
*  But I didn't realize that the dress work, Jelle, it's live, live, live. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2054.48s)]
*  It's not like live, live. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2057.48s)]
*  It's live, live, live. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2059.48s)]
*  It's live, live. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2060.48s)]
*  But I didn't realize that the dress rehearsal was for an audience. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2062.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2065.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2066.48s)]
*  I don't know why I would have missed that. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2067.48s)]
*  I guess just when you watch it, I'm not enough behind the curtains to know that side of the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2068.48s)]
*  business about how to solve it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2071.48s)]
*  So they can use that if they need. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2072.48s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that was an option either because they ended up running the skit that [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2074.48s)]
*  we did in rehearsal that didn't make the actual cuts. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2077.48s)]
*  They still ran it on YouTube. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2079.48s)]
*  They just didn't run it on TV because I was in the skit. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2080.48s)]
*  They just put it on YouTube. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2083.48s)]
*  But I didn't know that. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2084.48s)]
*  So I was like, oh, this is like crazy. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2086.48s)]
*  And that scared me because I nailed dress rehearsal. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2089.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2095.48s)]
*  You know how like you walk off and you're like, and I'm walking off and I nailed it so [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2097.48s)]
*  much that like they're clapping for me in the hallways. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2101.48s)]
*  And I'm like, don't jinx me right now. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2105.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2109.48s)]
*  I'm like almost feeling weird about it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2110.48s)]
*  Like don't praise me. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2111.48s)]
*  All this is fucking that didn't count. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2112.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2114.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2115.48s)]
*  Because we don't get to replace this one with that one. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2116.48s)]
*  It's not a next time. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2117.48s)]
*  That's not how live live TV works. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2118.48s)]
*  I don't get to come on and go, I like the first one better. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2119.48s)]
*  That is a choice on some live TV shows. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2122.48s)]
*  But it's like this isn't one of those. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2125.48s)]
*  This is like, all right, well, that was practice. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2128.48s)]
*  The next one's for real. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2130.48s)]
*  For seven million people tuned into the 50th season fucking opener. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2132.48s)]
*  You're like, I'm going to go out here and blow it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2135.48s)]
*  And then I spent two hours just thinking about how I was going to fuck it up. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2137.48s)]
*  I'm going to go out here and get this right. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2140.48s)]
*  That right. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2143.48s)]
*  In the green room. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2144.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2145.48s)]
*  I'm just in the green room in eight minute, by the way, just circling, just just I had [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2146.48s)]
*  to go out and sit with my wife and the audience. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2148.48s)]
*  So what are you thinking when you're on stage? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2150.48s)]
*  It's dark and then you hear ladies and gentlemen, Jelly Roll. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2152.48s)]
*  What's going through your mind in that moment? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2154.48s)]
*  I was like, why wasn't I this nervous the first time? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2155.48s)]
*  It was the same introduction. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2159.48s)]
*  Same people. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2161.48s)]
*  Now I know it's live. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2162.48s)]
*  So I'm sitting there thinking I should have pissed. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2163.48s)]
*  That's the first thing you're thinking. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2165.48s)]
*  You're like, I should have peed. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2166.48s)]
*  And you're like, I can hold this for three or four. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2167.48s)]
*  You ever do, do y'all have pre-show pisses? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2169.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2171.48s)]
*  I like one of those where like literally the host is going up to introduce you. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2172.48s)]
*  And you're like, I got to piss. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2175.48s)]
*  I already feel like, and if I'm nervous, one sip of water, I got to go to the bathroom. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2177.48s)]
*  It's not even crazy. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2181.48s)]
*  I'm not embarrassed or not ashamed to admit I had to piss on my first bucket on this tour. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2183.48s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2187.48s)]
*  What's up, yo? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2188.48s)]
*  Like on the side of the stage? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2189.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2190.48s)]
*  What did the rest of the arena do? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2191.48s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2193.48s)]
*  I have moments in the set built where I can kind of get away and figure things out if [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2194.48s)]
*  I have to. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2199.48s)]
*  Got it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2200.48s)]
*  I built three moments into the set for like just for me to breathe of nothing else. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2201.48s)]
*  But like, it's just something's going wrong with the ear pack. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2204.48s)]
*  You know, it's a big show. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2206.48s)]
*  I got to figure shit out sometimes. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2207.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2208.48s)]
*  So it was just one of them fucking figure it out moments. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2209.48s)]
*  And I told right before I walked out, I looked at my guy, Yanni, who's my guy in that particular [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2210.48s)]
*  situation. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2216.48s)]
*  I go, Bubba, I didn't pee. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2217.48s)]
*  He goes, he knew it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2218.48s)]
*  He knows I pee before every show. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2219.48s)]
*  He said, oh no, I said, I got an IV, Bubba. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2220.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to pee. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2221.48s)]
*  He's like, I have a bucket for you under the thing. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2222.48s)]
*  So I went under the stage and... [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2223.48s)]
*  Fucking 16,000 people peered. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2224.48s)]
*  Some guys doing an electric guitar solo. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2225.48s)]
*  And you're like, this feels weird. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2226.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2227.48s)]
*  You're like, but you've got to pee so bad, you don't have a choice. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2228.48s)]
*  You did that one time. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2229.48s)]
*  You did that one, wait. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2230.48s)]
*  Multiple times? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2231.48s)]
*  Multiple times. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2232.48s)]
*  Which was your version? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2233.48s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2234.48s)]
*  When I did Kill Tony at MSG, I was like, I'm going to have to pee. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2235.48s)]

*  Somebody's going to go up right now. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2267.48s)]
*  I'm like, OK, I go to the Ron White's dressing room to take a shit. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2268.48s)]
*  And as I'm like wiping, I hear them go, give it up from New York City. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2273.36s)]
*  So I'm like mid-wipe shit caked all over my ass. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2279.94s)]
*  Pull up my pants, go up there, sit down. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2282.84s)]
*  Didn't wash my hands at all. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2287.7s)]
*  Dap up everybody with the duty thing. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2289.12s)]
*  Went up there with the duty fingers. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2290.48s)]
*  No, I seen you look frantic when you got up there. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2291.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was a lot of energy. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  Because it was the last 12 minutes of the show. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2295.24s)]
*  We were sitting in front of the house smoking a joint. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2300.0s)]
*  I was like, he made it. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2301.56s)]
*  What about Amsterdam when they didn't have a bathroom in the whole backstage? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2302.56s)]
*  What was that one? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2308.3199999999997s)]
*  A little paper waste bin. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2309.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, peed behind the stage, right? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2311.3999999999996s)]
*  They had the fake green room that they built inside the arena thing. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2314.72s)]
*  But there's no bathrooms. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2318.52s)]
*  So you just had a rip in the trash can. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2319.52s)]
*  And then after the show you went up to some poor room and you're like, by the way, that [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2324.08s)]
*  trash can's gotta go. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2326.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean there was one time where I was wearing these pants. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2329.3999999999996s)]
*  You usually have a jean or something like that or a darker. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2332.2799999999997s)]
*  There was a pant I was wearing, I don't know why it was light. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2335.96s)]
*  And I peed and I was in a rush so I didn't let it dry. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2339.2799999999997s)]
*  You gotta shake. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2344.04s)]
*  I'm a shaker, I have to shake. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2345.04s)]
*  At my age I would say between 40% of my pee out when I pee and 60% when I pee. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2346.96s)]
*  And I didn't have time to shake. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2354.64s)]
*  And I remember running to stage and just feeling myself pee on myself. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2356.32s)]
*  Like a full pee. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2361.7999999999997s)]
*  Full pee. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  Like going down the leg as they're playing the intro video for me. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2363.7999999999997s)]
*  And I remember just taking the pants and rubbing it into one another. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2367.6s)]
*  I tried to dry it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2373.0800000000004s)]
*  Like pulling whatever shirt that I had down over it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2374.7200000000003s)]
*  You were wearing denim or something light too. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2377.32s)]
*  It was light. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2378.92s)]
*  It was light. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2379.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2380.92s)]
*  You and Alan, y'all brave with them light colored pants. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2381.92s)]
*  I got too much of a dribble too, man. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2385.92s)]
*  Oh, I'm straight dribbled. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2389.04s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2390.04s)]
*  The difference between me and you is when you shake it's just a shake. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2391.04s)]
*  I gotta do a little bit of hopscotching. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2394.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2397.44s)]
*  What was the game? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2398.44s)]
*  Twister. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2399.44s)]
*  I gotta do a little twister. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2400.44s)]
*  I gotta put one hand here, one hand here. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2401.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2404.56s)]
*  Give a little hip thrust. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2405.56s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2406.56s)]
*  He's like, I'll be very deliberate about peeing in the toilet when I'm peeing. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2407.56s)]
*  When I shake, it's a helicopter. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2412.08s)]
*  It's almost as if shake dribble, wherever that goes, doesn't count. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2414.8s)]
*  It's on the sink. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2422.0s)]
*  It's on the mirror. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2423.0s)]
*  Bathroom. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2424.0s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2425.0s)]
*  But I don't feel any need to clean that up. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2426.0s)]
*  For whatever reason. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2430.26s)]
*  It's the same pee. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2432.0800000000004s)]
*  It's like when you're in a pool and you pee, it's okay. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2433.0800000000004s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2436.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm interested. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2437.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm gonna go and see it even more. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2438.0800000000004s)]
*  But when you're in a pool and you pee, that's okay. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2440.0800000000004s)]
*  If you're outside of a pool and you pee into a pool, that's not okay. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2443.78s)]
*  Peeing in the pool versus peeing into the pool. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2447.26s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2449.26s)]
*  No. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2450.26s)]
*  Peeing into a pool is a little different. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2451.26s)]
*  You get out of a pool to pee? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2452.26s)]
*  I mean, I don't really swim like that to be honest. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2454.26s)]
*  I used to be honest. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2457.26s)]
*  But you would leave the pool to pee? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2459.26s)]
*  You would go do that? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2461.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2462.26s)]
*  You would do that? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2463.26s)]
*  You would do that? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2464.26s)]
*  You'd lie. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2465.26s)]
*  You'd not do that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2466.26s)]
*  I would. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2467.26s)]
*  I don't swim that much to pee. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2468.26s)]
*  You can stand on this. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2469.26s)]
*  As often as you pee, you're not doing that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2470.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2471.26s)]
*  So I'm gonna have to pull it every five seconds. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2472.26s)]
*  I don't swim very long, guys. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2473.26s)]
*  Now they got the stuff you put in the pool and it changes colors when you start urinating. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2476.26s)]
*  Is that real or is that just some... [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2480.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2481.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2482.26s)]
*  Now that's what you tell kids so they don't pee in the pool. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2483.26s)]
*  Maybe it's a fake video. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2485.26s)]
*  But what's up with the chlorine then? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2487.26s)]
*  What does the chlorine do? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2489.26s)]
*  I thought that's to clean out the pee. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2490.26s)]
*  That's why it smells like chlorine. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2491.26s)]
*  Funny. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2492.26s)]
*  I try not to piss in other people's pools. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2493.26s)]
*  Say again? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2494.26s)]
*  I try not to piss in other people's pools. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2495.26s)]
*  That's a policy I try to hold to. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2497.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2499.26s)]
*  My pool, if I got real piss... [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2500.26s)]
*  You were in his pool in Miami. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2501.26s)]
*  I hope you peed in it. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2502.26s)]
*  I don't think I peed in that pool. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2503.26s)]
*  He peed in that pool, obviously. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2504.26s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2505.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2506.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2507.26s)]
*  100%. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2508.26s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2509.26s)]
*  I didn't even know that you weren't supposed to. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2510.26s)]
*  You saying I don't pee in other people's pools, my brain just exploded. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2511.26s)]
*  I was like, oh, you're not supposed to do that? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2516.26s)]
*  Do you see it as taking your shoes off before you enter an Asian thing? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2519.26s)]
*  No, no, no, just like that. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2522.26s)]
*  Or in your home. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2524.26s)]
*  You don't take your shoes off the way? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2525.26s)]
*  No, I walk around the home. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2526.26s)]
*  I thought chlorine was to keep the water from getting stale, like pond water. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2527.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2532.26s)]
*  I thought it was to clean the pee out of the pool. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2534.26s)]
*  No, I think it's more for if water just sits stale like that and it don't get nothing, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2536.26s)]
*  no chemical in it, the water will start watering. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2541.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2544.26s)]
*  It will start growing. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2545.26s)]
*  I don't know what that means, but I get it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2546.26s)]
*  You get mosquitoes. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2548.26s)]
*  You get mosquitoes. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2549.26s)]
*  Listen, I grew up around a pond to tell you. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2550.26s)]
*  The water will start watering. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2552.26s)]
*  I was just telling you, man, I've been around a pond or two. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2554.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2560.26s)]
*  There's something for the pee. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2561.26s)]
*  The only thing that keeps the pool from being a pond is chlorine. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2562.26s)]
*  You know what the bummer about having a dribble is? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2566.26s)]
*  Is it like, I would never pee on my wife. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2569.26s)]
*  But let's say that we got to a point in our relationship where we were like, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2572.26s)]
*  let's try to spice it up, we're 60 years old or whatever. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2575.26s)]
*  Would you do it in the shower first? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2578.26s)]
*  No, but if I peed on her, and I wouldn't do this, but if I peed on her, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2580.26s)]
*  I would finish and then I have to be like, well, hold on, most of it's about to come out now. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2584.26s)]
*  It keeps us going. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2589.26s)]
*  We've got to be here for the little dribble. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2590.26s)]
*  I've got to spackle it up. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2592.26s)]
*  Here comes the helicopter. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2594.26s)]
*  Almost another ounce and a half out. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2598.26s)]
*  Yeah, so it would really just destroy the mood, as hot as it is, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2600.26s)]
*  just getting drenched in urine. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2604.26s)]
*  Then me being like, well, here comes the rest of it. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2607.26s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2611.26s)]
*  I'm fit to be 40. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2612.26s)]
*  I'm 40. My dick is 90. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2613.26s)]
*  I don't get the dribble. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2617.26s)]
*  My problem is my piss is in spurts. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2618.26s)]
*  I know when I think I'm done, I got another one coming. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2621.26s)]
*  I just got to be patient. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2623.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2624.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2625.26s)]
*  I've just got to stand there for another second and be like, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2626.26s)]
*  there's a whole other one of these on the way. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2627.26s)]
*  I've just got to sit here and relax. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2631.26s)]
*  I know that. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2633.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2634.26s)]
*  When you hold the hose closed. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2635.26s)]
*  Yeah, for exactly. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2636.26s)]
*  I know it's on the way. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2637.26s)]
*  You shit on the bus? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2638.26s)]
*  You shit on the tour bus? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2639.26s)]
*  No, no, I got to shit in a bag instead. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2640.26s)]
*  Have you ever had to shit during a show? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2642.26s)]
*  What? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2644.26s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2645.26s)]
*  There was one show where I went on stage knowing full well I had to shit. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2646.26s)]
*  And I remember I got off that stage and I beelined it to the bathroom and I filled that fucking thing up. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2654.26s)]
*  I created like a volcanic island. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2661.26s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2663.26s)]
*  The dude who filled the hole and then grew and then breached the surface of the water. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2664.26s)]
*  Those are great. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2668.26s)]
*  Those are satisfying. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2669.26s)]
*  I feel the class. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2670.26s)]
*  What's up? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2671.26s)]
*  Yeah, you killed it. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2672.26s)]
*  It's one of those where you look at your stomach in the mirror afterwards. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2673.26s)]
*  Check your abs. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2676.26s)]
*  It was one of those. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2677.26s)]
*  That was infamous. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2678.26s)]
*  Why? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2679.26s)]
*  Have you shit on stage? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2680.26s)]
*  Well, first of all, my wife's going to hate this podcast. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2681.26s)]
*  I have no shit shame and she shames me for it all the time. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2684.26s)]
*  Good. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2687.26s)]
*  I have zero shit shame. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2688.26s)]
*  We need that as well. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2689.26s)]
*  That's important. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2690.26s)]
*  I don't have it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2691.26s)]
*  But we were playing Pittsburgh at a bar that was connected to a bowling alley. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2692.26s)]
*  Nice. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2698.26s)]
*  So there was like this was the bar. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2699.26s)]
*  Back in the day, yeah. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2700.26s)]
*  Yeah, this is eight years ago, seven years ago. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2701.26s)]
*  Maybe it's like six years ago even. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2703.26s)]
*  And it's like a 500 capper, right? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2706.26s)]
*  There's no the backs. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2709.26s)]
*  Our green room is through the crowd. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2710.26s)]
*  It's one of those things. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2712.26s)]
*  And our green room didn't have a bathroom. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2714.26s)]
*  I hate that. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2716.26s)]
*  So you would have to go into the bowling alley. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2717.26s)]
*  What the fuck, dude? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2719.26s)]
*  But the way the backstage was set up behind the stage was like an outdoor fenced in area [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2721.26s)]
*  that you could sit at a picnic table. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2726.26s)]
*  You see where this story is going? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2728.26s)]
*  I'm on stage. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2731.26s)]
*  I like this. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2732.26s)]
*  Listen, man, I can't believe I've told this on this podcast. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2733.26s)]
*  And I feel it rumbling. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2737.26s)]
*  I'm like, it's going to happen. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2739.26s)]
*  I hit the drummer and I'm like, yo, I just need y'all to vamp. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2741.26s)]
*  Just like, you know, everybody gets a solo. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2745.26s)]
*  We don't even get ears. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2749.26s)]
*  So you don't have a microphone to talk back. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2750.26s)]
*  Like now we can go talk. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2751.26s)]
*  We have full conversations on that stage because we can hit one microphone that just us can hear. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2753.26s)]
*  Oh, smart. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2756.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy fire. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2758.26s)]
*  So it's like that wasn't an option. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2760.26s)]
*  So I'm having to like go to my guy like play. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2762.26s)]
*  I'm fixing this shit. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2765.26s)]
*  And I walk straight out the back door and where that little back patio was, drop my draws. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2767.26s)]
*  My wife standing right there going, what are you doing? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2772.26s)]
*  We've been married maybe a year. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2774.26s)]
*  And I had this is like prime drug, jelly roll, drinking, coating, cocaine. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2779.26s)]
*  Like my shit was it was just water almost just soft serve water. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2787.26s)]
*  And I'm just, I could not stop. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2794.26s)]
*  They played for me. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2795.26s)]
*  Was it coming down your thighs? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2797.26s)]
*  It's worse when fat people talk about it. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2799.26s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2801.26s)]
*  I'm imagining. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2803.26s)]
*  Was it coming down your thighs? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2805.26s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2806.26s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, I don't think you can avoid the thighs. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2807.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=2809.26s)]

*  But maybe that's what the foreskin or whatever [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3008.86s)]
*  was designed to do initially. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3011.3s)]

*  Yeah, that's a great idea. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3115.1s)]
*  Damn, it makes me wonder how they were [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3115.94s)]
*  shitting in festivals before that. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3117.46s)]
*  Oh, like Woodstock? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3119.5s)]
*  Woodstock was in the 60s though. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3120.66s)]
*  Yeah, but they, oh, that's a good point. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3122.18s)]
*  But yeah, though, they had a, that was a problem. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3123.82s)]
*  Man, you were like a fucking idiot. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3125.2200000000003s)]
*  They didn't have enough. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3126.06s)]
*  Well, I don't know if they had a porta potty or something. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3127.34s)]
*  No, but they didn't have enough. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3129.18s)]
*  The problem was, you know the story about Woodstock, right? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3130.02s)]
*  Y'all know this? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3132.9s)]
*  No. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3133.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna butcher it, and y'all correct me, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3134.56s)]
*  but at least in the spirit of me trying to get it right, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3135.86s)]
*  is they anticipated, based on like ticket sales, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3138.5s)]
*  this to be a flop. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3143.9s)]
*  They staffed it for like 4,000 people. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3146.06s)]
*  So what happened was, because it was so loose, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3149.8599999999997s)]
*  they didn't even put fences up or try to gate it or nothing. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3151.98s)]
*  They were just like, look, it's just kind of, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3154.46s)]
*  at this point, it's integrity. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3156.02s)]
*  We sold 4,000 tickets. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3157.22s)]
*  Anybody who wants to show up can come. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3158.3799999999997s)]
*  But back then, it wasn't like you could post out [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3160.18s)]
*  on fucking TikTok. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3161.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3163.9s)]
*  So they thought, you know, maybe our neighbors will come. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3164.74s)]
*  Maybe, you know, the community will come together. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3166.22s)]
*  They were expecting like five, 7,000 people at most. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3167.7s)]
*  When a half a million mother, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3171.04s)]
*  and the word started getting out. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3172.3799999999997s)]
*  Fucking Jimi Hendrix, all this crazy shit's happening, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3174.18s)]
*  and it's free. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3176.66s)]
*  They don't have a fence. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3177.7s)]
*  It's like, it's a third, you know, right? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3178.8199999999997s)]
*  So it immediately just like, the whole, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3181.8599999999997s)]
*  this part of America, right into it as well. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3185.54s)]
*  So yeah, no, there was shit everywhere. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3189.2999999999997s)]
*  I was a big part of it. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3190.62s)]
*  When you watch the documentary, it's super bad. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3191.46s)]
*  The other problem was they didn't know how to feed people. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3193.7799999999997s)]
*  And there were so many people backed up [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3195.7s)]
*  on the interstate highways. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3196.94s)]
*  That's why there was only one Woodstock. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3198.8799999999997s)]
*  It was a logistical nightmare. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3200.3799999999997s)]
*  They couldn't do this. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3202.0s)]
*  The other side of the beauty of what we see is [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3203.2000000000003s)]
*  they thought people were gonna die. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3205.46s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3207.76s)]
*  The locals came in and started cooking [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3209.12s)]
*  like big bowls of chicken and rice [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3210.8s)]
*  just to mass feed people. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3212.36s)]
*  They wasn't ready to feed that many. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3214.04s)]
*  They wasn't ready for, that area of New York [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3215.4s)]
*  wasn't ready for a half a million motherfucker. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3218.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3220.36s)]
*  Still probably beyond, still not ready at all. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3221.2000000000003s)]
*  You feel bad for the Fire Fest guy. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3223.52s)]
*  He's like, I went to prison for this. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3224.8s)]
*  And the Woodstock guy's got like [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3226.6400000000003s)]
*  the greatest documentary ever. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3228.28s)]
*  We're like, what the fuck? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3229.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3230.6s)]
*  Who's running it back though? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3232.2000000000003s)]
*  Fire Fest is running it back. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3233.04s)]
*  Is he gonna do it again? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3233.88s)]
*  Yeah, would you perform at Fire Fest too? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3234.7200000000003s)]
*  I think I'd probably pass. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3236.88s)]
*  I think I'd probably pass. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3238.68s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3239.52s)]
*  I'm all about second chances and redemption too though. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3240.34s)]
*  I would hear them out. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3242.32s)]
*  I would give them an audience. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3243.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3244.92s)]
*  Like, yo, what did you really learn? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3245.76s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3246.96s)]
*  Make sure he comes thirsty. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3247.8s)]
*  Did you not come out to like, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3248.62s)]
*  the problem is with prison is people either come out [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3249.58s)]
*  and really wanna change their life [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3253.16s)]
*  or they come out smarter criminals. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3254.44s)]
*  And that's the truth. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3256.96s)]
*  And you just, and I'm all about second chances. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3258.36s)]
*  So yeah, I'd hear them out. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3260.4s)]
*  But my gut reaction is fucking no. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3262.04s)]
*  Not in that long. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3263.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3264.52s)]
*  But I'm also just not into being on a plane that long [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3265.3599999999997s)]

*  And I can tell you one of the most pieces of parent advice [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3780.98s)]
*  I can give my two young fathers here, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3783.62s)]
*  especially for you and your wife, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3786.18s)]
*  which I've met both of your wives [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3787.42s)]
*  and I think they're both sweet people. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3788.66s)]
*  It's important for y'all to find time to not be parents. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3792.22s)]
*  And I know you're early in the process, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3795.46s)]
*  so that sounds unreal. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3796.94s)]
*  No, no, you're right. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3797.7799999999997s)]
*  This moment. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3798.62s)]
*  But it is important that y'all go to Burning Man [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3799.46s)]
*  and completely fucking lose your mind [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3801.42s)]
*  and forget the kids downstairs. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3803.14s)]
*  That is the only thing that will make [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3804.46s)]
*  that balancing act work. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3805.8999999999996s)]
*  Because a little night out with some wine [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3807.38s)]
*  or a weekend away at a hotel, a staycation, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3809.7400000000002s)]
*  or that's not enough. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3813.38s)]
*  You need every now and then to go out [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3814.94s)]
*  and be like, we're fucking college kids again. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3816.78s)]
*  We're fucking gonna get naked and swing from chandeliers. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3819.82s)]
*  We're gonna get kicked out of a fucking hotel. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3823.06s)]
*  Like it's important every now and then. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3825.46s)]
*  All parents out there listening, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3827.86s)]
*  trust the fat man with this one, y'all, I swear. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3829.2200000000003s)]
*  It is a backbone of something me and Bunny have stood by. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3831.78s)]
*  It's like it is important to every now and then, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3834.7s)]
*  because even you'll go out and do stuff, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3837.5s)]
*  we're parents 24 hours a day, seven days a week, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3838.7s)]
*  three or six, five days a year. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3840.94s)]
*  Every now and then, I just don't need to be one. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3842.82s)]
*  You know, it's funny, it's like you spend so much more time [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3845.86s)]
*  with your wife or your partner or whatever [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3849.7s)]
*  once you have a kid. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3851.82s)]
*  But it is fundamentally nothing like the time [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3854.06s)]
*  that you've spent in the past. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3857.14s)]
*  So before any time you get together, right, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3858.38s)]
*  as a dude, you obviously calculate, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3861.3s)]
*  you're like, okay, we got tons of time this week [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3862.82s)]
*  this is awesome, we didn't get time next week. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3864.5s)]
*  But when you're with the baby, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3868.78s)]
*  you think you're getting that same experience, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3870.02s)]
*  but you're not filling each other up in the same way. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3872.22s)]
*  You're getting filled up by that baby. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3874.18s)]
*  That baby is euphoria, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3875.42s)]
*  But there is another component, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3877.44s)]
*  which is filling each other up. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3879.58s)]
*  And whether, I don't know if it's, you know, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3881.66s)]
*  you gotta go crazy every single time, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3883.62s)]
*  but literally just making sure you go out to dinner. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3885.46s)]
*  Like that's something that my wife and I, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3887.42s)]
*  a half hour going to get coffee. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3888.94s)]
*  Like having 30 minutes where we can talk to one another, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3890.78s)]
*  maybe there's some shit we gotta work out. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3893.3s)]
*  Maybe there's a disagreement we got. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3894.94s)]
*  And there's just, well we don't wanna argue [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3896.5200000000004s)]
*  for the baby. We don't wanna argue [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3898.1400000000003s)]
*  around the baby. Exactly. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3898.98s)]
*  Like creating those times. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3899.82s)]
*  And at first you almost feel selfish. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3901.94s)]
*  You're like, why am I trying to create time [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3903.42s)]
*  with me and my wife when we have a baby? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3905.7400000000002s)]
*  Like we should be spending every single second with the baby. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3907.3s)]
*  But you realize that maybe that's the most important thing [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3909.6200000000003s)]
*  for that baby. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3913.5400000000004s)]
*  Like if things are great between us, everything's good. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3914.42s)]
*  And if they're not good between us, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3917.98s)]
*  they are in a really difficult situation. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3919.78s)]
*  If something nobody will prepare you for, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3923.5800000000004s)]
*  nobody talks about it. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3926.0200000000004s)]
*  Like nobody tells you right before you have a kid, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3927.78s)]
*  by the way, your relationship is gonna completely change [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3929.26s)]
*  the dynamic, the how you guys spend time. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3932.1800000000003s)]
*  And you need to be ready for that change [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3934.38s)]
*  and do everything that you need to make sure [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3936.42s)]
*  that you're both getting what you need from each other [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3938.4s)]
*  within that change. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3940.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a whole extra prioritization too. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3942.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3943.98s)]
*  Initially it's like I'm just, you know, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3945.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm already juggling work and these other ideas I have [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3946.2200000000003s)]
*  and ambitions and dreams and hobbies with my wife. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3948.8s)]
*  And then it's easy to lump them together. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3952.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh, it's my wife and kid. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3954.3399999999997s)]
*  And I had to learn fast, like it's not. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3955.8999999999996s)]
*  It ain't that. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3957.46s)]
*  That is one thing with me and my wife are a separate thing [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3958.2999999999997s)]
*  and this where it gets deeper when they get older. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3960.2599999999998s)]
*  And me and my kid are a separate thing too. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3962.18s)]
*  Cause then you'll fall guilty sometimes. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3964.14s)]
*  Be like, oh, I've got it great. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3965.7799999999997s)]
*  I got the wife and kids and then I got the wife. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3966.62s)]
*  It's like, well, no, you still gotta go sit down [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3968.14s)]
*  and be just a dad too. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3969.8599999999997s)]
*  She needs just you. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3970.7s)]
*  Yeah, like you still gotta go put in that. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3971.54s)]
*  And you need that just her time too. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3973.3799999999997s)]
*  You need that just her time. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3974.22s)]
*  It's important for growth. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3975.3399999999997s)]
*  And me, sneaking away, getting them dinners, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3976.54s)]
*  going on those things, they're important, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3978.82s)]
*  equally important, once a year go blow it out. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3980.6200000000003s)]
*  Be fucking irresponsible. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3983.3s)]
*  It's important. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3984.5400000000004s)]
*  I stand by it, dude. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3985.38s)]
*  It's been such an important thing for me and my wife. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3986.94s)]
*  There's that thing on Instagram that like everybody's been, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3989.42s)]
*  every male friend group has been forwarding to one another [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3991.82s)]
*  and none of us have been forwarding to our wives. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3994.5400000000004s)]
*  But it was like, study says that men need two nights out [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3996.02s)]
*  a week with the boys. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=3999.5800000000004s)]
*  Have you guys seen that pop up on your Instagram? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4000.5400000000004s)]
*  No, fuck my algorithm doing it. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4002.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4003.86s)]
*  Girls in control of it. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4005.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4006.38s)]
*  But like, it is, I don't know what the exact number is. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4007.62s)]
*  Like obviously we're very lucky we get to come here [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4011.06s)]
*  and like shoot the shit and just have a lot of fun. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4012.74s)]
*  But that is an important thing to communicate as well. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4014.7799999999997s)]
*  Like that's a really hard thing to say to the person [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4019.9s)]
*  you love more than anything in the world is, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4021.7799999999997s)]
*  hey, I need to not be with you tonight. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4023.18s)]
*  For sure. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4025.2599999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4026.1s)]
*  I think my wife was like, I just love spending time [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4026.94s)]
*  with you. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4029.02s)]
*  And I was like, I also love spending time with me. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4029.86s)]
*  So I need to do that right now. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4033.14s)]
*  I need about an hour with me. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4037.98s)]
*  What you're feeling is what I'm feeling. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4039.34s)]
*  I need that right now. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4040.86s)]
*  Bunny quit drinking many years ago [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4042.62s)]
*  and everything I gave up, I'll still go out [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4044.82s)]
*  and tie one on every now and then. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4046.62s)]
*  And I've cut it back immensely, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4049.5s)]
*  but that's what Bunny does understand is that [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4050.7400000000002s)]
*  when I do have that ranger in me, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4053.06s)]
*  Bunny is, I love her for this, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4055.66s)]
*  cause my wife stands, she'll call it early. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4057.02s)]
*  She'll be like, you might just need to find a night [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4059.86s)]

*  yo, Salsa said to sell her. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4171.42s)]

*  where you fucking aren't you. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4183.9s)]
*  That's a lot of confidence for her to say that too. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4185.5s)]
*  Like for her not to see that as a sense of rejection, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4187.3s)]
*  like you don't wanna be with her. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4189.9s)]
*  And that takes time also, like it's maturity. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4191.58s)]
*  It's very easy, I think, to get caught up, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4195.38s)]
*  many when we can get caught up in this feeling of like, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4197.219999999999s)]
*  oh, if my partner doesn't wanna be with me, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4199.259999999999s)]
*  does that mean they don't like me? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4200.98s)]
*  Am I not as fun as that other thing? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4203.3s)]
*  Do they wanna be with someone else? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4204.98s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4206.179999999999s)]
*  Do they wanna be with someone else cooking? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4207.06s)]
*  You're right. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4207.9800000000005s)]
*  And we both do it. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4208.820000000001s)]
*  And then instead of saying, hey, I'm hurt, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4209.660000000001s)]
*  we get upset at them or try to catch them in things [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4211.580000000001s)]
*  because it's way easier to be like, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4214.06s)]
*  you're wrong than say, I feel insecure. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4215.18s)]
*  So I like commend her for that. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4217.540000000001s)]
*  That's a very mature position. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4220.3s)]
*  I'm telling you, and I was gonna go hang out with her. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4221.660000000001s)]

*  She knows like, this dude's been fucking, you know, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4229.3s)]
*  like, cause when I get to get in those situations, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4232.580000000001s)]
*  I don't have to be the dude. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4234.46s)]

*  That's interesting. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4243.120000000001s)]
*  I didn't think about it like that. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4243.96s)]
*  Like everybody, when you're on tour [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4245.34s)]

*  There wasn't a lot of opportunity to show personality. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4316.06s)]
*  Like you're only seeing art and you're only seeing pictures. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4318.860000000001s)]

*  of like who somebody is. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4326.740000000001s)]

*  and would have projected myself into critical mass. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4791.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4794.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4795.76s)]
*  It would have not favored me for sure. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4796.58s)]
*  What I thought was cool though is like, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4797.42s)]
*  because if you ask me a question, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4799.12s)]
*  I'm gonna give you a real answer. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4800.12s)]

*  yeah, so what do you think this is? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4802.96s)]
*  And I was like, all right, well, these are my thoughts on it. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4804.4s)]
*  And that's heavy. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4806.92s)]
*  If you're asking me to describe your perception, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4808.88s)]
*  where your career is at, all these different things, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4812.48s)]
*  and I tell you honestly, and he was like, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4815.16s)]
*  he thought he was, he reflected on it. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4817.36s)]
*  He was like, oh wow, I can see that. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4819.0s)]
*  A lot of people would fight [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4820.5599999999995s)]
*  for their perceived identity in that moment [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4822.959999999999s)]
*  and be like, no, I disagree with you [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4825.879999999999s)]
*  about these types of things. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4827.04s)]
*  But he like analyzed it and said, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4828.08s)]
*  oh, okay, I could see why that might be that. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4829.2s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that was kind of cool. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4831.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4832.5199999999995s)]
*  Man, every conversation I've ever had with him, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4833.36s)]
*  he's so, even down to like this, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4836.679999999999s)]
*  I joked with you that night and I'm in it. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4838.08s)]
*  I'm like, I'm his publicist right now, it's high field. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4838.919999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4841.16s)]
*  I'm out here showing the world [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4842.0s)]
*  that this dude is so much, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4843.6s)]
*  even when we got back to circle back to the him and him thing, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4845.360000000001s)]
*  it's like, that's why I see so much of them in each other. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4848.240000000001s)]
*  I just think that he was so young during all of that too. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4850.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4854.52s)]
*  Like even what he did to initially make him mad [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4855.360000000001s)]
*  into the battle era of like, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4857.52s)]
*  man, that dude's got a, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4859.56s)]
*  we're watching this new video with him [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4861.56s)]
*  and I'm getting choked up watching his daughter [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4862.88s)]
*  get married and announce a child. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4864.88s)]
*  But equally, I'm just with MGK at MGK day in Cleveland [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4867.52s)]
*  and he's got a 16 year old [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4871.04s)]
*  that's like already taking college classes. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4873.0s)]
*  Like a genius kid. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4876.08s)]
*  He's like, this dude flies every weekend from LA [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4877.48s)]
*  to go be a volleyball dad. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4882.04s)]

*  if people knew that about you, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4886.6s)]
*  besides this picture of you wearing this fucking [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4888.76s)]
*  wild outfit, you know what I'm saying? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4890.68s)]
*  Like it would be such a, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4892.36s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4897.8s)]
*  Whenever I'm talking to you and I'm seeing the consistency, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4898.64s)]
*  I'm like, where you at? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4900.24s)]

*  I'm like, damn, is he volleyball again this week? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4901.9s)]
*  He's like every weekend dog for 28. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4903.08s)]
*  He quit, he took a year off of touring. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4905.12s)]
*  Tens of millions of dollars, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4907.88s)]
*  like, man, it's gonna be like one of the last years [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4909.16s)]
*  I can watch her play. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4910.679999999999s)]
*  Like that's the kind of duty is it, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4912.2s)]
*  like where his spirit's at right this particular moment. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4913.96s)]
*  And that's the type of thing that comes out [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4916.0s)]
*  when you share your personal life. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4916.84s)]
*  But it's scary to share your personal life too. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4918.72s)]
*  Super. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4920.44s)]
*  Especially when, I imagine like there's certain people [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4921.28s)]
*  in the industry that have, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4923.5599999999995s)]
*  their idea of like crafting a rock star [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4925.76s)]
*  is a very specific certain thing. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4928.44s)]
*  And they're like, no, we have to keep you as mysterious [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4931.08s)]
*  and weird and all this other stuff. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4934.48s)]
*  And he might be like, okay, well, yeah, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4935.919999999999s)]
*  I like doing rock and I like dressing weird, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4937.719999999999s)]
*  but I also like going to volleyball games with my daughter. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4940.24s)]
*  And that's often more relatable than the mystery. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4942.639999999999s)]
*  I think he like grew up in Egypt too or something. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4946.4s)]
*  Like doesn't he have like Christian missionary parents [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4948.32s)]
*  or something like that? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4950.2s)]
*  I know his mother's like a Viking or something like that. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4951.679999999999s)]
*  That's why he got all the blacks. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4953.919999999999s)]
*  I swear, man, like super, it's a crazy story. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4955.04s)]
*  That's why he got all that black out shit tattooed on him. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4957.16s)]
*  It was a great, he told me one night the full story [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4959.12s)]
*  but it was, I was really high. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4960.92s)]
*  I was really, really, so I don't want to butcher [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4962.36s)]

*  When was the last time you tied one on? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4967.16s)]
*  When was the last time you really went for it? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4968.0s)]
*  SNL. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4970.0s)]

*  Late night? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4972.5s)]
*  We came out of a burlesque bar at eight o'clock [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4973.639999999999s)]

*  I played on Saturday Night Live. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4989.04s)]
*  You know how fucking absurd that is? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4990.96s)]
*  Like when you really start rapping, like if you, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=4994.2s)]

*  But even the early, dude, we played bars for, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5042.1s)]
*  when you see my show and double the test for this, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5046.02s)]
*  it reeks of a man who's done a thousand. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5048.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5052.14s)]

*  I gotta get the fuck off here. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5065.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5067.14s)]
*  There's a difference between people who have had like years [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5067.9800000000005s)]
*  on the road, especially with comics, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5071.86s)]
*  and then comics who like kind of blow up quick. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5073.58s)]
*  And they can be funny, the comics that blow up quick, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5075.82s)]
*  but there's different chops on stage. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5077.78s)]
*  And I imagine the same thing is probably multiplied by 10 [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5079.82s)]
*  when it comes to bands or when it comes to music. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5082.62s)]
*  Like there's no replacement for a decade of shitty shows, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5084.58s)]
*  because that is gonna put you in every scenario possible. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5090.66s)]
*  Dude, it's, the TikTok era, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5093.82s)]
*  ooh man, this is good, Shultz, has done this so much [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5097.679999999999s)]
*  because these kids will blow up [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5101.86s)]
*  and be able to sell 2,000 tickets [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5103.58s)]
*  but have never done a single show in their life. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5105.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you saw it with- [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5107.54s)]
*  Or 3,000 or 5,000. With all due respect, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5108.62s)]
*  like you saw with Ice Spice in our earliest shows, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5110.22s)]
*  like here's this girl that goes from not doing anything [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5112.18s)]
*  to these like massive shows, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5114.38s)]
*  and she had to learn how to perform. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5115.54s)]
*  You gotta learn how to perform in front of the world. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5117.06s)]
*  Like she had to, and imagine how scary that is. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5118.74s)]
*  You go from rapping in some random studio [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5121.42s)]
*  to having 10,000 people in front of you. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5124.34s)]
*  And you're just like, fuck, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5126.82s)]
*  it's not just saying the words anymore. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5128.22s)]
*  I gotta dance, I gotta have charisma. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5129.62s)]
*  It's a different game. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5131.24s)]
*  It is a totally different game. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5132.24s)]
*  It's also about them getting honest booking agents. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5135.599999999999s)]
*  I'm watching this Aaron Hernandez thing [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5139.719999999999s)]
*  on the FX right now. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5141.24s)]
*  And it was so interesting when he's meeting with his agents. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5142.84s)]
*  Have y'all seen it yet? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5144.88s)]
*  I've heard it's pretty bad. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5145.84s)]
*  They say that about all the FX shows like it. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5147.679999999999s)]
*  But I'm so into the story, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5149.5599999999995s)]
*  I would watch the animation [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5151.36s)]
*  of whatever Aaron had happened to that story. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5154.32s)]
*  It's crazy to me. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5156.32s)]
*  I've watched everything you can about it. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5157.16s)]
*  But it was interesting. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5158.88s)]
*  I'd never seen the side of him meeting with the agents. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5159.84s)]
*  And whether it's true or not, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5162.12s)]
*  it reminded me of the TikTok era. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5163.7s)]
*  Because all these agents are coming in [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5166.04s)]
*  and they're like, you're a first round draft pick, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5167.6s)]
*  you're a superstar. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5169.82s)]
*  And then one agent comes in and goes, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5171.64s)]
*  you're gonna be lucky if we get you picked in the third. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5173.8s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5176.16s)]
*  And he's like, I've already picked my guy, get out of here. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5177.0s)]
*  He said, I will. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5179.4800000000005s)]
*  But have they told you what's happening at the combine? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5180.4400000000005s)]
*  And he just kind of starts leaning in like, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5182.68s)]
*  they didn't tell you you gotta answer questions [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5184.6s)]
*  for three hours, did they? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5186.54s)]
*  They didn't tell you that all 52 teams [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5187.88s)]
*  get to ask you questions for three hours a piece? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5189.64s)]
*  Did they tell you this? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5192.6s)]
*  And he's going, he said, yeah, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5193.4400000000005s)]
*  that's because the other agents are lying to you. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5194.68s)]
*  Call me when you realize what's really going on. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5196.16s)]
*  So he ends up picking that guy though. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5199.08s)]
*  But it's like, that's happening in the TikTok world. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5201.12s)]
*  Because some agents going in with their mom and dad, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5203.08s)]
*  sometimes he's TikTokers, right? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5205.12s)]
*  And this agent is going, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5206.88s)]
*  I can get y'all making $20,000 a show right now. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5208.2s)]
*  We're gonna go right into theaters. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5211.76s)]
*  We're gonna do, do, do, do, do. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5213.4400000000005s)]
*  And then they go meet another agent, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5214.4800000000005s)]
*  who's the right guy who goes, look, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5216.52s)]
*  I think we need to go play this like 300 cap room circuit. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5219.88s)]
*  Let's go do like 40 of these. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5223.240000000001s)]
*  Just get her familiar with standing on stages, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5224.88s)]
*  looking at people in the eye. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5227.0s)]
*  We'll put her in theaters in the spring, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5228.740000000001s)]
*  slowly next spring, we'll ramp her up, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5230.56s)]
*  and we'll put her on an amphitheater tour [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5233.360000000001s)]
*  in three years with somebody. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5234.8s)]
*  And they're like, fuck you. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5236.76s)]
*  And they go to the agent and puts them [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5237.6s)]
*  in front of 2000 people. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5238.56s)]
*  And they go out and fucking blow it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5239.96s)]
*  And it sucks. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5241.6s)]
*  And everybody reviews it, and the internet, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5242.5s)]
*  and all their TikTok fans review it, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5244.400000000001s)]
*  and start arguing with each other [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5246.68s)]
*  about how bad the show is. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5247.5199999999995s)]
*  I see it happen to my business all the time. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5248.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5250.28s)]
*  And the ones who do it right are the ones who go out, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5251.12s)]
*  Jesse Murph, the one I did Wild Ones with, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5252.96s)]
*  example of doing it right. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5255.36s)]
*  She could have came out the gate [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5256.96s)]
*  selling thousands of tickets. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5258.5599999999995s)]
*  Man, they sent that girl over to Australia. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5260.36s)]
*  They sent her to the UK to do clubs. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5263.04s)]
*  They sent, I think, I mean, they had her going [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5265.76s)]
*  to doing abroad shows before she was doing [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5267.96s)]
*  big domestic shows. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5270.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, they're gonna go figure it out. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5271.8s)]
*  Get your chops over there, figure out, get comfortable. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5273.5599999999995s)]
*  It also shows how smart she was. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5275.8s)]
*  She was in no rush. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5277.72s)]
*  She was just like, yeah, I know what I love about Jesse is, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5278.68s)]
*  she's like my little sister. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5281.8s)]
*  She's so confident in what she does. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5282.64s)]
*  She's like, I'm here. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5284.92s)]
*  I just needed somebody to see I can do this. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5286.24s)]
*  I'm gonna do this forever. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5287.72s)]
*  That's how she thinks. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5288.96s)]
*  So she wasn't in no rush. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5289.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5290.64s)]
*  She really cut her teeth. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5291.4800000000005s)]
*  And even then, just when she comes out with me at MSG, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5292.400000000001s)]
*  after that night, I tell my wife, I'm like, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5296.16s)]
*  is that not a different person from even just [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5298.2s)]
*  who came out with me at Jingle Ball MSG last year? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5300.72s)]
*  She was like a completely different person. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5303.6s)]
*  I was like just watching her. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5306.52s)]
*  She'll be in arenas probably next year if I had to guess. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5308.52s)]
*  Please stay empathetic. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5310.76s)]
*  Can I say just about his show without spoiling [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5312.16s)]
*  what the show entails? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5314.200000000001s)]
*  One thing I'll say, and I was involved at the show, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5315.84s)]
*  it's a stadium show in an arena, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5318.8s)]
*  which I think the last time I made that comment [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5320.8s)]
*  was when we saw Travis Scott. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5322.56s)]
*  But just in terms of using the whole room, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5324.52s)]
*  where I'm like, you'll be at MetLife doing this same thing, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5327.280000000001s)]
*  where there's multiple stages, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5329.8s)]
*  there's the runway that you're on, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5332.200000000001s)]
*  and I'm like, this guy is using it, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5334.04s)]
*  and it's not only that, we've seen enough shows at MSG [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5336.360000000001s)]
*  now that we can compare. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5337.72s)]
*  You could just play up against that end stage [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5340.0s)]
*  and you're just seeing a concert. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5341.96s)]
*  You're blocking, meaning the positioning [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5343.4800000000005s)]
*  that he's going between songs, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5346.200000000001s)]
*  and when he's moving around these runways to the audience, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5347.52s)]
*  the entire arena, his production is changing, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5350.8s)]
*  things are lowering, the skull, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5354.360000000001s)]
*  everything was just so perfectly planned. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5357.160000000001s)]
*  You're like, this guy's done this for years, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5360.200000000001s)]
*  and he wouldn't waste, to do that level of production, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5362.84s)]
*  you can't cheat that. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5365.88s)]
*  That's something where we can now keep on adding it. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5367.4400000000005s)]
*  You're probably part of the production. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5370.04s)]
*  You told us how many trucks you have coming into that, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5371.84s)]

*  you're all in store, we'll call it whatever, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5384.360000000001s)]
*  but I didn't give anything, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5386.96s)]
*  but you can tell who came out. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5388.0s)]

*  And he can perform his ass off, dude. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5397.56s)]
*  Listen, man, I have a rule that I don't watch a performer [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5399.64s)]
*  without stealing something. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5403.0s)]
*  It's my personal rule. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5404.52s)]
*  The good ones borrow, the great ones steal, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5406.0s)]
*  that's my rule. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5407.68s)]
*  If I come see you, stole something from you the other night, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5408.52s)]
*  it's what I do. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5410.6s)]
*  I'm coming, I'm watching, I'm stealing. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5411.4400000000005s)]
*  I love it. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5413.52s)]
*  And Bus was on my stage for four minutes, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5414.360000000001s)]
*  and I stole something. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5416.240000000001s)]
*  That's how good he is. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5417.240000000001s)]
*  What'd he do? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5418.08s)]
*  Four minutes. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5419.16s)]
*  Four minutes. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5420.0s)]
*  His opening was so old school hip hop. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5420.84s)]
*  It was like, so I set it up. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5423.4s)]
*  There's this really, my show is really, I'm telling a story, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5425.36s)]
*  but I'm telling two stories, right? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5429.68s)]
*  But they're the same story in the end, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5432.24s)]
*  the story of music, the story of the therapy of music [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5433.4400000000005s)]
*  and how we all grew up listening to different kind of music. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5435.72s)]
*  And I do this by like playing my music [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5438.4s)]
*  and then I'll throw covers in there to show the crowd like, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5440.32s)]
*  oh, you don't think you know country music, but. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5443.0s)]
*  And then I have a trick where I'm like, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5446.24s)]
*  you don't think you listen to hip hop, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5447.24s)]
*  but I do it in the form of a story, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5448.48s)]
*  which I'll tell you off camera [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5450.2s)]
*  because I want you to punch it up. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5451.2s)]
*  But I set it up and I set the story, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5454.32s)]
*  you heard me set the story up and I'm like, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5456.679999999999s)]
*  yeah, and I grew up listening to, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5458.759999999999s)]
*  I'm in New York so I'm playing to it. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5459.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I grew up listening to 50 Cent, which I did. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5461.24s)]
*  I grew up listening to Jay-Z. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5463.679999999999s)]
*  I grew up listening to Big L. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5465.759999999999s)]
*  I grew up listening to shit like, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5467.679999999999s)]
*  and then Bus comes out, right? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5469.44s)]
*  And it comes out and it's like one of them hip hop like, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5471.679999999999s)]
*  da, da, da, hold up, da, da, da, turn the music up, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5473.5599999999995s)]
*  da, da, da, da, jelly roll, ba, ba, ba, ba, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5477.4s)]
*  and every time the beat would break, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5481.04s)]
*  he would just scream something else, left side, oh, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5482.599999999999s)]
*  da, ba, ba, right side, oh, and him and spliff. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5485.36s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5488.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm watching them, dude, I'm standing behind them, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5489.5199999999995s)]
*  having a, I got them on my legs now, a goose bump moment. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5491.36s)]
*  And I'm like, that's why this dude [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5495.08s)]
*  is one of the greatest performers in hip hop history. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5497.16s)]
*  Man, what song did he come out to? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5499.5599999999995s)]
*  Fuck, I don't remember the first record. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5504.32s)]
*  It went in to break your neck. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5506.24s)]
*  Don't this hit make my people wanna, jump, jump. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5510.0s)]
*  He did like a three minute, it was so hard to keep, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5512.639999999999s)]
*  he did a three minute medley and did all the hits. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5514.28s)]
*  He did a medley of all the hits. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5515.12s)]
*  He did a four minute medley [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5516.44s)]
*  and I think I heard a piece of every one of his hits, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5517.5599999999995s)]
*  it was crazy. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5519.2s)]
*  He even put in the past the Cavasier, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5520.12s)]
*  but just the musical part as it interlude [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5522.5199999999995s)]
*  into another big one. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5524.8s)]
*  So it didn't even come in, it was just that, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5526.639999999999s)]
*  der, der, der, der, don't this hit make my people wanna. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5528.16s)]
*  And it was just so, and I was just like, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5532.599999999999s)]
*  man, what a way to do it. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5534.7s)]
*  We were broke when I first moved to LA, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5535.54s)]
*  so we would just go see rappers at the late night shows, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5536.94s)]
*  like Conan or Carson or whatever the fuck, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5539.26s)]
*  Conan film, like it's in New York, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5540.86s)]
*  but we saw him at like, Carson Daly or something. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5541.9s)]
*  The room is half full. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5544.38s)]
*  He comes out, fucking destroys in a way, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5545.62s)]
*  I've been to rap concerts, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5548.66s)]
*  I haven't seen anything like this outside of Travis Scott. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5549.82s)]
*  And I was, everybody, and then one girl walked out [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5552.34s)]
*  and she was like, man, I saw him at the House of Blues, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5554.54s)]
*  bottles were literally shaking on the bar, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5556.86s)]
*  just from how much everybody was jumping. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5558.72s)]
*  Like, he was, he's crazy performer. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5560.42s)]
*  You have no clue how good he was like. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5563.26s)]
*  Has anyone come to the shows that like, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5564.1s)]
*  it blew your mind, like your manager was like, [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5565.9400000000005s)]
*  by the way, Jelly, this person's gonna be [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5567.740000000001s)]
*  in attendance tonight. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5569.34s)]
*  They were like, what the fuck? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5570.18s)]
*  Ooh, that's a good one. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5571.42s)]
*  I don't think nobody that I didn't see coming, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5572.26s)]
*  like as far as like, you know, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5574.14s)]
*  everybody I'd already kind of built a relationship with, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5576.38s)]
*  so nobody kind of surprised me. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5578.9800000000005s)]
*  But I'm still surprised anytime anybody comes to my show. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5582.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5586.14s)]
*  Like, I'm still like, oh, y'all know I do this. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5586.9800000000005s)]
*  But I think anytime an athlete comes out, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5589.820000000001s)]
*  it's always a little different for us, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5591.620000000001s)]
*  because there's a lot of synergy with me and y'all, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5592.98s)]
*  a lot of synergy with like anything on this side of art, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5595.62s)]
*  but I don't have as much synergy on that side. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5598.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5601.98s)]
*  So like, I still get excited every time Jimmy Butler [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5602.82s)]
*  posts one of my songs. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5605.139999999999s)]
*  Like the kid in me is just like, that's fucking crazy. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5606.58s)]
*  He posts me like once a month. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5609.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5610.339999999999s)]
*  But it still doesn't get any less exciting. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5611.179999999999s)]
*  You know, that kind of stuff. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5613.74s)]
*  So like a couple of actors that are starting to kind of [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5614.74s)]
*  come around to what I do has been cool. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5617.379999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5619.0599999999995s)]
*  But it's been pretty cool. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5619.9s)]
*  I think even like Bus agreeing to come sing with me [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5621.14s)]
*  was really, really special. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5624.46s)]
*  Even post you gave like his own section of the show, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5626.660000000001s)]
*  like he had his songs and the ones he has with you, right? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5630.22s)]
*  Yeah, we did our song and then we did a, yeah, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5632.42s)]
*  no, we did a country song again, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5634.18s)]
*  then we did one of his. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5635.46s)]
*  I love Post, man. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5636.3s)]
*  Post is another one I'd love to have on this couch. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5637.14s)]
*  Dude, he'll do it. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5639.26s)]
*  I'll put you on the text tonight. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5640.62s)]
*  Let's do that. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5642.3s)]
*  I gotta talk him out of being a cowboy fan. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5643.14s)]
*  That's a done, that's the easiest connection I'll ever make. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5645.26s)]
*  That dude is the most, people in Nashville go, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5648.34s)]
*  Jelly Roll's one of the nicest guys ever [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5651.74s)]
*  until they meet Post Malone. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5653.219999999999s)]
*  They're like, Jelly Roll's kind of an asshole. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5655.0599999999995s)]
*  Post Malone is dead sweet of a dude. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5657.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he was really sweet. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5657.9s)]
*  When we did Crypto, he pulled up and he did a few songs. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5658.74s)]
*  It was pretty awesome. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5663.0199999999995s)]
*  That's just his fucking personality, dude. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5663.86s)]
*  That dude is fucking, he don't, he is like, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5665.5s)]
*  he don't care is what makes him special. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5669.419999999999s)]
*  Like we're backstage and I still play like it's a bar. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5672.419999999999s)]
*  I know it's an arena, but man, me and Post didn't talk about [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5675.339999999999s)]
*  what we were doing until 20 minutes before the show. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5678.58s)]
*  We didn't have one conversation about it. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5681.02s)]
*  And I'm like, yo, what about like, let's do this cover? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5682.66s)]
*  He's like, oh, I was like, first thing I said, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5684.98s)]
*  when I see him in the hallway, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5686.54s)]
*  I'm like, you cool with just fucking around? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5687.36s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I was like, I'll see you later then. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5688.78s)]
*  Right then I knew it wasn't nothing to worry about. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5690.14s)]
*  I was like, I'm just gonna talk to this dude later. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5691.86s)]
*  And I went, I was just like, yo, let's just go fuck around. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5693.74s)]
*  Let's do this cover and do this. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5696.18s)]
*  And I was like, if I end up wanting to keep you out [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5697.28s)]
*  for this record, will you stay? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5699.42s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I'll stay. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5700.54s)]
*  And sure enough, I was like, fuck, we gotta do this record. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5701.66s)]
*  It's the second biggest song in the world right now. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5703.82s)]
*  Him and, that I had some help with him and Morgan. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5706.42s)]
*  I was like, I can't have you at this show [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5709.5s)]
*  and have some help with the second biggest song [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5711.099999999999s)]
*  in the world right now. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5713.219999999999s)]
*  We don't do it. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5714.0599999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5714.9s)]
*  He's like, you'll do Morgan's part? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5715.74s)]
*  I was like, hell no. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5716.7s)]
*  I was like, I'll butcher it. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5718.0599999999995s)]
*  I'll do the hook and the bridge. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5720.34s)]
*  He's like, all right, cool. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5721.86s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5722.82s)]
*  Do you have like any insight or opinion [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5723.66s)]
*  on like the whole drama with Beyonce [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5725.34s)]
*  not getting nominated for any country awards? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5727.5s)]
*  Man, this is a slippery slope too. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5730.179999999999s)]
*  And I'll hang here with you [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5732.46s)]
*  because I'm willing to with my friends. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5733.62s)]
*  I think that the body of art was incredible. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5737.78s)]
*  There's no denying that like, I always take, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5741.9800000000005s)]
*  take all politics out of it before we even talk about those. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5745.38s)]
*  What did the art actually say? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5747.82s)]
*  Was it good? [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5750.14s)]
*  Right? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5751.3s)]
*  And the record was good. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5752.14s)]
*  I don't know if it was Beyonce's best record. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5755.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5758.42s)]
*  It didn't make me feel the way even Renaissance [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5759.24s)]
*  made me feel as a full body of work. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5760.94s)]
*  But there was two or three songs on there [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5763.379999999999s)]
*  that I thought could be country song of the year for sure. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5764.66s)]
*  What she did with Jolene alone to me [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5768.54s)]
*  could have been was just unbelievable. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5770.379999999999s)]
*  You know, and how much Dolly loved it. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5772.7s)]
*  To me, that's the real tale, right? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5774.58s)]
*  If Dolly loves it, it's a big deal. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5775.98s)]
*  So my argument starts with the art. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5778.54s)]
*  My argument is, yeah, I think she should be nominated [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5780.099999999999s)]
*  because the art was worthy of being nominated. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5781.86s)]
*  The flip side of the argument, this isn't my argument. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5784.86s)]
*  So I don't want to get crucified or nailed at this cross. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5786.82s)]
*  Is that Nashville is a small community [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5788.94s)]
*  that is trying to keep country music [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5792.66s)]
*  as a boundary list genre. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5794.5s)]
*  And I know boundary list seems like, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5796.9s)]
*  that's the opposite of not putting Beyonce in it. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5798.219999999999s)]
*  But meaning like, they never allowed country [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5801.379999999999s)]
*  to get put in sub genres like rock did. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5803.98s)]
*  So like, they've kind of like, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5806.339999999999s)]
*  country is one of the last genres left [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5807.54s)]
*  that you could just say [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5809.379999999999s)]
*  there's a country music concert happening [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5810.2s)]
*  and a certain group of people will still just show up. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5812.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5815.86s)]
*  Like, it don't really matter. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5816.679999999999s)]
*  It's like, you know what I mean? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5817.52s)]
*  Like, you can say there's a pop concert happening [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5818.52s)]
*  and somebody's going, who's gonna be there? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5821.240000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5822.88s)]
*  They can say, hey man, there's a country concert happening [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5823.72s)]
*  down the street and people will kind of just blindly go [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5826.360000000001s)]
*  based on the consistency of country music. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5828.52s)]
*  That's being ran by the town of Nashville, my city, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5831.76s)]
*  where I'm from. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5835.200000000001s)]
*  But this is being ran from the industry. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5836.120000000001s)]
*  It's like how, you know, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5837.76s)]
*  like all the record labels are in New York for hip hop. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5838.6s)]
*  All of them are for pop in LA or you know, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5840.8s)]
*  how it used to be, whatever. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5842.320000000001s)]
*  Now it's kind of everywhere. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5843.280000000001s)]
*  But these people looked at it, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5844.280000000001s)]
*  the people who are the 20,000 registered, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5847.04s)]
*  30,000 registered voters. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5849.8s)]
*  Like the Grammys only has that many voters [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5851.84s)]
*  or 60,000 or some 100,000, whatever it is, right? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5853.48s)]
*  These people that are in that, look, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5856.5199999999995s)]
*  they are only really hip to what's happening in Nashville. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5858.2s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5863.16s)]
*  So it's not as malicious as one thinks. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5864.0s)]
*  It's not like in my mind, from what I know of these people, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5865.5199999999995s)]
*  the few, I don't know all 16,000 voters neither, right? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5868.48s)]
*  Or I'd fucking win more. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5870.8s)]
*  But it's like, the ones I know are just more like, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5871.92s)]
*  they just missed it. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5876.8s)]
*  Because to them, it was more of like, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5877.64s)]
*  you know, it was a big TikTok moment. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5879.4400000000005s)]
*  The Texas Hold'em song. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5880.8s)]
*  You know, we're like in country music, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5882.320000000001s)]
*  there's, you know, we have, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5884.96s)]
*  there's three award shows, bare minimum, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5886.320000000001s)]
*  four really now, a year that really matter. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5889.88s)]
*  Like to us as a community, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5892.12s)]
*  like the ACMs, which is the Academy of Country Music, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5893.400000000001s)]
*  the CMAs, which is the biggest night of country music. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5897.0s)]
*  This is the one that's coming up. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5899.28s)]
*  It's the Country Music Association. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5900.24s)]
*  I won the best new artist last year. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5901.52s)]
*  That was the speech. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5903.12s)]
*  That was awesome. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5904.56s)]
*  That was that speech. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5905.400000000001s)]
*  That is the one though. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5906.24s)]
*  That's like, that's a really big deal. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5907.08s)]
*  I'm nominated for entertainer of the year this year. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5908.44s)]
*  This is a huge, huge honor. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5910.16s)]
*  Congrats, my guy. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5911.92s)]

*  I think they just didn't see the visibility of the album. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5914.8s)]
*  Not that the album wasn't huge [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5917.12s)]
*  and it wasn't impactful or a great piece of art. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5918.48s)]
*  They just didn't see the visibility of it. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5920.2s)]
*  She didn't tour it. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5922.4s)]
*  It wasn't like Morgan Wallen is like [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5923.719999999999s)]
*  out here selling out three stadiums a night [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5925.88s)]
*  like Beyonce did for Renaissance. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5927.8s)]
*  Now had the same campaign happened for Renaissance [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5929.639999999999s)]
*  that happened with this album, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5931.96s)]
*  I would have stood up and been like, this is wrong. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5933.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5936.96s)]
*  But like to them, it was more of like an, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5937.8s)]
*  I can't speak for all 16,000 [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5939.8s)]
*  and this isn't how I feel. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5941.8s)]
*  Just what I've heard is like to them, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5943.4800000000005s)]
*  it just felt like an eclectic art piece [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5945.0s)]
*  to try to broaden the horizons of the space. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5946.56s)]
*  And they felt like that a nod that's even bigger, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5949.320000000001s)]
*  some people in this town feel like [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5951.8s)]
*  what's even bigger than giving her a nod was [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5953.360000000001s)]
*  that Shaboozy broke by being on her album [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5955.84s)]
*  and he's up for best new artist of the year [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5958.160000000001s)]
*  and looking like a winner. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5960.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5961.6s)]
*  And he's having a huge year at Country Radio [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5962.48s)]
*  and a huge year at all the country award shows [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5964.28s)]
*  and like he's in Nashville in the community writing. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5966.32s)]
*  But he's a fan of the culture. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5969.44s)]
*  Yeah, he loves the culture of Nashville. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5971.08s)]
*  Whereas Beyonce is a little bit more [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5972.44s)]
*  of an outsider than a kind of. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5974.799999999999s)]
*  And I'm not saying, I don't think that makes it right [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5976.48s)]
*  that she wasn't nominated. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5978.2s)]
*  I want to be clear about that. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5979.5199999999995s)]
*  She's a colonizer, is what you're saying. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5980.36s)]
*  Yeah, thank you Shultz, thank you Shultz. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5981.48s)]
*  No, I get that, she's more of a colonizer. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5983.48s)]
*  Gentrifier if you will. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5985.48s)]
*  I only wanna be the guy who takes the wisdom. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5986.32s)]
*  Kind of using the art form and yeah, I got you. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5987.919999999999s)]
*  A Kardashian. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5990.04s)]
*  That you got it. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5990.879999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5991.98s)]
*  Got it, I got it. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5992.82s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5993.66s)]
*  I do, man. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5995.34s)]
*  I got it, I got it. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5996.179999999999s)]
*  I get the point you're trying to make. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=5997.98s)]
*  I wouldn't say any of those things. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6000.0599999999995s)]
*  I think she has a brilliant talent in art. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6001.5s)]
*  I love lemonade. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6003.42s)]
*  But it is, yeah, I get it. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6005.94s)]
*  These are the tough things that you gotta work on. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6007.46s)]
*  No, I get it because it's the same in the film world [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6009.179999999999s)]
*  and the academy. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6011.38s)]
*  Nobody asks. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6012.22s)]
*  I'm from there. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6013.0599999999995s)]
*  Just joking, go, go, go, go. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6013.9s)]
*  I'm saying it's the same thing that applies [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6014.9s)]
*  like why people see like the nominations. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6016.78s)]
*  There's 10,000 people in the academy [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6018.26s)]
*  and like I would guess what percentage of that's like [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6019.82s)]
*  over 60 that's just been focused on like [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6023.34s)]
*  what Hollywood gives you, what wins [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6025.78s)]
*  at some of the film festivals. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6027.62s)]
*  So you have to think who's coming from the outside. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6028.74s)]
*  I wasn't upset when I lost at the Grammys this year [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6031.0599999999995s)]
*  because I knew that to the Grammy audience, I was new. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6033.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6036.46s)]
*  A lot of these people didn't know I was a human [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6037.299999999999s)]
*  until they see me on the bill. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6038.58s)]
*  And then they see me at the best new artists, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6040.219999999999s)]
*  like performance, and then they see me in the building [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6042.0599999999995s)]
*  and they felt my spirit and now I feel like [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6044.5s)]
*  next year I might have a better, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6046.82s)]
*  I feel like every year I'm building. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6048.219999999999s)]
*  A better chance towards it. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6050.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6051.34s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6052.16s)]
*  There might have also been a perception where it's just like [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6053.0s)]
*  if you're the size and success story, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6054.42s)]
*  just the magnitude of Beyonce, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6058.98s)]
*  and you pick any other genre to create music in, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6060.74s)]
*  you're also like one of the most talented human beings ever, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6063.38s)]
*  you pick any other genre, it's gonna be popular. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6065.82s)]
*  Like if she decides to do techno, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6068.38s)]
*  it's gonna be a number one. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6070.0599999999995s)]
*  Like whatever genre she decides to do it. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6071.74s)]
*  So maybe there's that feeling where it's like [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6073.98s)]
*  anybody that big that decides to do country [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6077.0599999999995s)]
*  is gonna have the number one album, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6080.26s)]
*  they have to be embedded in the culture [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6081.1s)]
*  and really invest time in the culture [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6083.18s)]
*  to be considered like one of these artists. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6084.82s)]
*  And was it really impactful [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6086.66s)]
*  or was it just Beyonce dropping an album? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6087.5s)]
*  Because she's at the size where she can't be avoided. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6088.74s)]
*  Like if she decides to put out a rap album, number one. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6091.34s)]
*  Like anything she puts out is number one. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6093.62s)]
*  I've said this a minute then, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6094.7s)]
*  I was on record early about this, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6096.0s)]
*  I'm glad it stood the test of time. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6097.78s)]
*  Of course obviously, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6101.78s)]
*  and there's gonna be country music fans [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6102.62s)]
*  that are gonna be like, you wasn't welcome here. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6103.82s)]
*  But it's like I was so glad she was here. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6105.58s)]
*  I welcomed her with open arms. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6107.7s)]
*  Like I was like- [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6109.38s)]
*  I think it's great for country. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6110.22s)]
*  Same thing I felt about Post. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6111.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you're telling me? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6112.46s)]
*  Great for country. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6113.74s)]
*  Do you know how hard it was to get people to like, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6114.58s)]
*  especially in the world of music, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6117.74s)]
*  people would just fly right over Nashville to Memphis. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6119.62s)]
*  Just didn't even think about it. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6122.86s)]
*  Whether it was hip hop, blues, soul, anything, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6124.099999999999s)]
*  Memphis had all the culture. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6126.42s)]
*  I mean, Nashville just frog jumped over. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6127.96s)]
*  Anything that was like country music in itself, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6131.0199999999995s)]
*  country culture, like what Beyonce did [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6134.099999999999s)]
*  for fucking cowboy hat sales is unheard of. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6136.42s)]
*  No, no, listen man, this is a true story. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6140.82s)]
*  I went to the, there's a, right there on Sunset, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6142.5s)]
*  I wish I could remember his name, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6146.22s)]
*  my boy Miles was with me that night, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6147.18s)]
*  he's a cowboy for really rad horses, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6148.46s)]
*  my dude that you thought looked like the crud guy. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6150.06s)]
*  He went to this shop and it's like an old school, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6154.26s)]
*  famous spot on Sunset that sells leather belts, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6156.26s)]
*  leather hats, just like an old cowboy store [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6158.62s)]
*  right there on Sunset. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6160.38s)]
*  And he went in there and the guy said, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6161.9400000000005s)]
*  he's known the guy forever, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6163.4800000000005s)]
*  like I've been in the store 20, 30 years or something. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6164.42s)]
*  He goes, how's business? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6166.82s)]
*  He goes, better than ever. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6167.900000000001s)]
*  He goes, really, what's happening? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6169.62s)]
*  He said two things, Morgan Wallen and Beyonce. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6170.9800000000005s)]
*  Literally, that's exactly like, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6175.900000000001s)]
*  and this is an old man's perspective who probably, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6178.18s)]
*  you know what, doesn't know what's going on in the world, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWQnnOZHNE&t=6180.78s)]
