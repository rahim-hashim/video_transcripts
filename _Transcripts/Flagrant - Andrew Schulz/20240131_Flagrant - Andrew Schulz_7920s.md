**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc)
*  I was in the studio with Kanye. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=0.0s)]
*  Already I'm like, this is the best day of my life. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1.6600000000000001s)]
*  And then Drake walked in. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3.62s)]
*  So I know you're a huge fan of Kanye West. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=6.04s)]
*  You've heard about this whole anti-Semitism thing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=6.84s)]
*  you've been talking about? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=8.0s)]
*  What? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=8.8s)]
*  How much was the music video for Ha Ha Ha? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=9.6s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=11.84s)]
*  I spent like a million dollars. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=12.64s)]
*  Do we get more Dave or no? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=13.64s)]
*  Me and Benny act that way. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  This guy's my best friend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=17.64s)]
*  We're just talking, naked in the shower. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=19.04s)]
*  Who's bigger? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=21.12s)]
*  Him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=21.68s)]
*  My dick looks like a raisin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  There was that stuff with E.O. on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=24.32s)]
*  He was upset. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=25.96s)]
*  How do you deal with something like that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=26.68s)]
*  I'm happy that you brought that up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=27.62s)]
*  What I crave deep down is like the undeniable love [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=29.14s)]
*  and respect of everyone on Earth. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=32.12s)]
*  I crave deep down. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=33.68s)]
*  I literally thought it was going to be like just inner peace. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=35.88s)]
*  This is the best form of clothing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=40.62s)]
*  Especially in the winter time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=41.62s)]
*  The hockey jersey. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=42.82s)]
*  In the winter time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=43.46s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=44.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=44.62s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  There's something about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=45.8s)]
*  With the drawstrings, whatever these are, it's just like, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=47.4s)]
*  I'm so attracted to it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=50.34s)]
*  Not sexually, just like I just want to only wear that type of. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=51.54s)]
*  Is it versatility or you think it's just cool? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=56.06s)]
*  It's that cool. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  I think hockey jerseys are the coolest sports jersey to wear. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=59.58s)]
*  Like if I was just wearing a basketball jersey right now, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=62.86s)]
*  it looks like something else. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=64.86s)]
*  Can I be honest? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=65.66s)]
*  Underrated is the baseball jersey. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=66.06s)]
*  Yeah, baseball jersey's cool. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=67.56s)]
*  Baseball jersey's cool. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=68.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't have the edge. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=69.2s)]
*  The long sleeve and then just the breathe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=72.74s)]
*  And then now that they have these necks and the string, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=73.34s)]
*  it feels like a fashion piece. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=76.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=78.5s)]
*  You can accessorize almost. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=79.97999999999999s)]
*  I don't like when they do the hockey jersey over the hoodie, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  though. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=82.7s)]
*  To me, that feels like it's too juvenile. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=83.66s)]
*  It's kind of like college behavior. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=86.02s)]
*  There are some people that are wearing it ironically. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=88.14s)]
*  And by some people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=91.42s)]
*  You mean white people? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=93.82s)]
*  White people, yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=94.62s)]
*  No. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=95.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=95.92s)]
*  That's exactly what I meant. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=96.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=99.98s)]
*  I think I lost my train of thought. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=100.46s)]
*  It's something like that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=101.82s)]
*  And then I was drawn to him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=102.46s)]
*  He's a handsome guy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=103.5s)]
*  Never played hockey a day in his fucking life. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=104.46s)]
*  He's fresh. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=106.14s)]
*  That's where he's from. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=106.62s)]
*  It's identity. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=108.06s)]
*  That's how I know black people are climbing up the Association. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=109.74s)]
*  It looks good, by the way. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=111.74s)]
*  I just want to point this out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=112.62s)]
*  Like the twists are new or something. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=113.9s)]
*  No, I got it retwisted yesterday. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=116.7s)]
*  So it's new? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=117.42s)]
*  Yeah, retwisted. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=118.06s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=119.02s)]
*  It's not new. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=119.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  He's never taken a comment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=122.69999999999999s)]
*  This is new. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  I think we started the podcast. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=125.34s)]
*  Guys, we're here with Dave, everybody. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=128.14s)]
*  First desk in the building. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=128.62s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=131.1s)]
*  My boy, how are you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=131.98s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=132.94s)]
*  This is... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=133.66s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=134.46s)]
*  I'm in the Big Apple. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=134.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=136.22s)]
*  I know you guys are used to it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=136.54s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Every time I come here, I'm like, wow, what a new... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=138.22s)]
*  Philly's not far. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=139.82s)]
*  You probably came here a lot. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  I did, but it just was different. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=142.3s)]
*  Like, I actually didn't come that often as a kid. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=143.82s)]
*  I would come on school field trips, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=146.46s)]
*  and then we'd go to Times Square, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=147.9s)]
*  and I would get hustled out of my money. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  That was my experience of New York City. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=152.3s)]
*  But coming as an adult man with friends that live here [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=153.98s)]
*  in different areas and pockets, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=157.34s)]
*  it's just a totally different atmosphere now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=159.02s)]
*  OK, we won't be offended. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=160.78s)]
*  Honest take on New York City? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=162.46s)]
*  Well, I don't know that I could live in New York. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=166.3s)]
*  Yeah, I knew we were going to get some good. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=169.82s)]
*  I knew we were going to get some good. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=171.58s)]
*  I don't know that I can. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=172.38s)]
*  Why not? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=173.02s)]
*  Too many Jews? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=173.74s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=174.94s)]
*  A lot. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=175.42s)]
*  Number one. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=175.9s)]
*  I'm just the type of... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=178.7s)]
*  I just like space. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=179.98s)]
*  I think it really comes down to my desire to have space. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=181.34s)]
*  And even this is totally not New York City, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=184.14s)]
*  and I don't even know why my brain is going to this point, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=186.78s)]
*  but I just went to the Amalfi Coast this past few... [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=188.46s)]
*  Listen, let me tell you something. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  You're going to be playing Padelan Six, my friend. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=193.42000000000002s)]

*  He has. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=201.82s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=202.22s)]
*  I get there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=202.7s)]
*  I hated that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=204.22s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  Positano? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=205.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=206.62s)]
*  You can't go to Positano. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=207.42s)]
*  You can't even... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  The amount of... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  What's a rich combo? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=209.1s)]
*  I can't... [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=209.98s)]
*  Like, if I can't move more than this amount of wall space left to right... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=212.62s)]
*  It's awful, awful, awful. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=216.38s)]
*  I'm just like, I feel trapped. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=217.34s)]
*  I feel like there's nothing for me here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=218.54s)]
*  The water is cool, I guess, but I've never liked an ocean view. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=221.5s)]
*  I find it very one-dimensional. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=224.7s)]
*  I never have been the beach guy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=229.1s)]
*  I live in Venice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=230.62s)]
*  I live in Venice, LA. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  I go to the beach once every four years. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=234.06s)]
*  I'm kind of with you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=235.17999999999998s)]
*  What about that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=235.82s)]
*  One dimensional. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  One dimensional. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=237.5s)]
*  Trees on a farmstead. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm actually with you on that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=241.1s)]
*  I'd rather like to do it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=244.7s)]
*  Hold on, so you don't... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=245.26s)]
*  I've never been a beach view guy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  Is that what you said? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=249.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=250.38s)]
*  Like, most expensive real estate in the world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=250.54s)]
*  I go... [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=252.7s)]
*  I've been to plenty of beaches and I go there and I get so bored. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=252.94s)]
*  I just sit there and I look and everything is just flat. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  And like, there's just no texture. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=259.98s)]
*  I would rather be in a situation where every tree is different looking. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=262.06s)]
*  And I'm just like... [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=266.14s)]
*  You want to be in the Bob Ross painting? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=266.7s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=267.98s)]
*  With the mountains and all that, the trees. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=269.02s)]
*  There's little creatures. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=270.62s)]
*  There's woodland creatures you can look at. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=271.58s)]
*  There's things you can hike. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=272.86s)]
*  It's so one-dimensional. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=274.94s)]
*  Yeah, I get that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=276.3s)]
*  And beyond being hot and boring. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=277.18s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=280.62s)]
*  You sit there? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=281.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=281.58s)]
*  You just sit there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=282.14s)]
*  The beach life is unbelievably boring. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=283.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=286.46s)]
*  I've never liked it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=287.42s)]
*  Anyway, so I went to the Amalfi Coast and I just felt very constrained [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=288.54s)]
*  as far as being able to run. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=291.82s)]
*  Did you go anywhere else? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=293.9s)]
*  Did you leave Positano? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=294.94s)]
*  Positano is objectively awful. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=295.9s)]
*  I mean, no. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  It's just like tourist trap. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  So touristy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=299.26s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=299.9s)]
*  And three stores for trinkets. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=300.46s)]
*  There's no culture. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=301.58s)]
*  It's just trinkets and one road. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=302.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=304.06s)]
*  And an ocean view. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=304.62s)]
*  And the sand is black. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=305.9s)]
*  Anyway, so New York City is... [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=308.7s)]
*  Boo hoo, guys. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=309.9s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=310.7s)]
*  Listen, you know what I mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=311.58s)]
*  Black sand sounds fire. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=312.7s)]
*  Black sand is great. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=313.74s)]
*  Black sand sounds fire. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=314.94s)]
*  The whiter and pinker sand is... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=316.78s)]
*  They're in a hotel and they were like, bracy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=318.46s)]
*  No, the other one. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=321.66s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=322.38s)]
*  I can't remember the name of it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=323.26s)]
*  And it was really... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=324.7s)]
*  There was a lot of things I loved about the hotel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=325.34s)]
*  It was great service and I did feel like a little white lotusy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=327.42s)]
*  Wow, this is really the top of the line hotel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=330.78s)]
*  But they were like, it's the only private beach in Positano. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=333.5s)]
*  And I was like, well, great. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=336.7s)]
*  At least we have our own beach. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=337.98s)]
*  I go to the beach... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=339.26s)]
*  El Uo Te O San Pietro. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=340.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=341.5s)]
*  It's just a hunk of concrete. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=342.14s)]
*  It's like a prison yard. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=345.26s)]
*  They carve it out of the... [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=347.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=348.94s)]
*  I was like, you stamp me the private beach. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=349.82s)]
*  Like, it's literally a hunk of... [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=351.34s)]
*  I don't want to do this, but you calling Positano Beach a prison yard is the whitest thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=353.34s)]
*  I've never heard it in my life. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=359.18s)]
*  I feel bad doing that to the white guy, but it really left out at me. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=360.3s)]
*  Yeah, I understand. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=364.46s)]
*  It's the wrong thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=365.02s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=366.62s)]
*  It is, though, Dave. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=367.34s)]
*  It is a fucking prison yard. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=368.3s)]
*  And sometimes we have to submit ourselves. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=369.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=372.06s)]
*  And you would know because you've been to prison. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=372.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=373.9s)]
*  Like, you're from there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=374.38s)]
*  Isn't it? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=375.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=376.06s)]
*  But anyways, New York, there's a lot that I... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=376.56s)]
*  I think I would love... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=381.2s)]
*  I love being here like a week at a time, and I might even like being here like for a full season. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=382.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=386.72s)]
*  Like six to nine weeks of like... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=387.44s)]
*  I'd love to figure out something to shoot here that puts me here when the weather is right. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=390.4s)]
*  That is true. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=397.28s)]
*  Fall? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=398.4s)]
*  Fantastic in New York. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=399.04s)]
*  Fall in New York is the best. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=400.24s)]
*  Almost nice. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=401.36s)]
*  Fall is the best. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=402.08s)]
*  There's a lot of charm. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=402.4s)]
*  And just as far as aesthetic, I think a lot of the shows and movies that I see shot in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=403.36s)]
*  New York just jump out and look better to me than the shows that are shot in LA. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=407.36s)]
*  There's an energy to it, for sure. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=411.12s)]
*  So anyways, I'm happy to be here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=411.76s)]
*  Why are you here? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=417.44s)]
*  Actually, I just put... [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=419.92s)]
*  So I put out a soundtrack album called Penis to my TV shows. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=420.56s)]
*  And I figured I'd make the rounds a little bit. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=425.12s)]
*  How much was the music video for Ha Ha Ha? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=429.92s)]
*  I know I'm counting pockets, but you just said you were on a Mophie show. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=430.56s)]
*  Self-financed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=433.44s)]
*  I didn't ask that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  It all came out of my pocket. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=438.32s)]
*  That's what that means. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=440.64s)]
*  You know what self-financed means? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=442.88s)]
*  In case you didn't know, you paid for it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  That's how you know the money still matters. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  Honestly, it was kind of reckless. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  I spent like a million dollars. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=451.68s)]
*  What? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=453.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=453.6s)]
*  And it was a million in Lithuania. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  So a million all the way in Lithuania to be able to even afford this video. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=456.64s)]
*  If I tried to shoot this video in LA, it would have cost me like five million. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=464.96s)]
*  It looked incredibly expensive. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=465.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=467.44s)]
*  And it was like, oftentimes I'm down to invest in something that I know can be like a Freaky Friday, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=467.68s)]
*  huge smash hits. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=475.2s)]
*  I knew that this song would never... [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=476.72s)]
*  It couldn't ever be. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=478.16s)]
*  It's not designed. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=478.96s)]
*  It's not like a pop song. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=479.76s)]
*  It's like essentially a four-minute verse. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=480.72s)]
*  But I love it so much. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=484.4s)]
*  And I just really wanted... [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=485.92s)]
*  I've always wanted to make a video like this that didn't rely on being funny. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=487.84s)]
*  That was just epic filmmaking and really unique things. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=491.44s)]
*  So I went out to Lithuania. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=495.44s)]
*  By the way, great host country for the event. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  How long could you stay there if you had to? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=501.44s)]
*  I was very charmed by Lithuania. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=504.96s)]
*  Many weeks, maybe a month or two. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=505.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Many... [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=507.52s)]
*  It rains every day. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=507.84s)]
*  It rains every day. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's freezing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=513.12s)]
*  Immediately, by the way, once I finished that video, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=514.48s)]
*  immediately got bronchitis. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=516.32s)]
*  I couldn't even move. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=518.08s)]
*  Fever for two weeks. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=519.12s)]
*  That's the price you pay, though. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=520.48s)]
*  But I am really proud. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=521.5200000000001s)]
*  The price is a million. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=522.48s)]
*  A million plus bronchitis. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=525.7600000000001s)]
*  But I'm really happy. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=528.08s)]
*  At least I didn't pay a million and was like, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=529.2s)]
*  oh man, this missed the mark. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  I really think creatively I look at it and I'm very... [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=531.84s)]
*  The video's sick. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  It shot sick. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=535.12s)]
*  But it was one of those things where I was like, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=535.84s)]
*  this looks like one of the most expensive fucking videos. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=537.44s)]
*  To put that in perspective, a million, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you remember... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  You're 35, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=543.84s)]
*  Okay, do you remember when Diddy, old Diddy, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=544.24s)]
*  we can talk about it, put out a victory? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=547.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, I mean all those videos. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=550.8s)]
*  I grew up... [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=552.08s)]
*  That was one million. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=552.48s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were gonna say, hate me now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  Hate me now is also one million. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=555.36s)]
*  Oh, that was the... [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=556.72s)]
*  Him and Nas. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=558.08s)]
*  That was Nas. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=558.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=559.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to be a dickhead, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=559.52s)]
*  but a million back then is probably like three, four million. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=560.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=562.4s)]
*  I was gonna say that too. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=562.96s)]
*  What a fucking... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=563.84s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=564.64s)]
*  That was fantastic. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=565.12s)]
*  But yeah, it's not a back in the day million, buddy. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=566.4s)]
*  You had to go to Lithuania still, you know? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=569.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=571.52s)]
*  But still, a million fucking dollars. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=572.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=574.88s)]
*  And I just kind of also know I'll never... [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=576.24s)]
*  There are certain things where you know [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=578.4s)]
*  you will make your investment back. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  How much have you made back on the AdSense? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  Can we look at that? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=582.4s)]
*  No, the video has like 1.2 million views. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=583.2s)]
*  Even I think YouTube views are down. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=588.72s)]
*  The whole website. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=592.32s)]
*  YouTube.com is going through a recession. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=594.0s)]
*  I'm about to get the antibiotics for the bronchitis. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=597.36s)]
*  It made its money, buddy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=601.2s)]
*  It will live forever. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=602.48s)]
*  It will live forever. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=603.2s)]
*  I'm really... [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=603.84s)]
*  I just like it's a new thing that I've never done [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=605.36s)]
*  and I loved acting in that first scene, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=607.84s)]
*  like getting into character in a different way [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=610.4s)]
*  and I just thought it was just... [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=612.24s)]
*  I have no regrets. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  I have no regrets. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=614.8s)]
*  I love that you are always willing to flex [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=615.36s)]
*  your artistic muscles. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=617.76s)]
*  Even the concepts that you'll talk about shooting in, Dave, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=621.6s)]
*  I'm like, that's incredibly artistic, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=624.88s)]
*  even though he's never gonna do that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=628.0s)]
*  Like the end of season one, you had a video, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=629.2s)]
*  the episode you were thinking about shooting, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=630.96s)]
*  and then season two, the VMA performance. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=632.32s)]
*  I was like, these, even not getting done, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  really fucking artistic ideas. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=636.72s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, man. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=638.08s)]
*  I definitely put my best foot forward [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=640.08s)]
*  and try as hard as I can to be great. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=641.9200000000001s)]

*  It's under your total control. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=656.08s)]
*  Then you go to big bad Hollywood. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  How frustrating. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  They shackle me. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=663.52s)]
*  They made you put out an environmental video [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=664.24s)]
*  just so you could get the show. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=666.0s)]

*  Frustrating beyond belief or they kind of let you do your thing. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=677.12s)]
*  I'm pretty fortunate in like FX [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=681.84s)]

*  They kind of knew what they were signing up for, I think. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=687.6s)]
*  Once you prove yourself, I think they're like, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=690.0s)]
*  this guy knows what he's doing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=692.2399999999999s)]
*  I've never really felt creatively hampered [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  in a way where I wanted to do something [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  and executives are like, no, you can't do that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=699.52s)]
*  I've never experienced that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=702.2399999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=705.76s)]
*  But I think at least I kind of have made, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=706.16s)]
*  my start has been one where I think I am known [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=708.8s)]
*  for being a creative, whatever, risk taker. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=711.68s)]
*  You go for it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=716.3199999999999s)]

*  Like gets in business with me. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=718.48s)]

*  We're talking about it right now. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=859.84s)]
*  Honestly, I'm really in the headspace right now. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=860.88s)]
*  What happens was the writer's strike happened. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=863.92s)]
*  I then had time off to finally finish certain songs [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=866.0s)]
*  that were in the show and put the soundtrack album together. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=870.4s)]
*  And I got back to making music truly for the first time [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=872.72s)]
*  in five years. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=875.76s)]
*  I was able to focus on music. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=876.88s)]
*  And then I really totally refell in love with making music. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=878.16s)]
*  I came into this making music and it's been truly five years [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=881.68s)]
*  since I've been able to actually focus on it [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=884.96s)]
*  for more than six weeks at a time. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=886.8s)]
*  And right now, I'm spending every day making music [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  and fully thrilled by that idea to the point where [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how long I'm gonna work on music, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=897.28s)]
*  but I also know that the show has kind of reached this height, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=898.8s)]
*  whatever that is. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=902.88s)]
*  I don't believe my music career has reached that height [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  that my show has reached. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=908.16s)]
*  So you want the music to reach Dave's success. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=909.12s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=911.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I feel like I'm capable of it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=912.16s)]
*  And I feel like truly, how much time do I have left [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=914.4s)]
*  on this earth of going for it as a rapper? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=918.4s)]
*  Like in 10 years, I don't know. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  It might be like if I'm still rapping, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=923.28s)]
*  you might be like, we gotta talk about this, Dave. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  So I'm just really anxious to maximize my potential [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=927.52s)]
*  as a musical artist, because I've just never. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=929.92s)]

*  I'm sure we're gonna have experiences today that. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=934.8s)]
*  I feel like it's gonna be a while since we get more Dave. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=936.8s)]
*  I kind of feel that's what I'm... [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=940.8s)]

*  And time will tell. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=951.52s)]
*  But right now, I'm so satisfied with like [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=953.52s)]
*  the three seasons I just cranked out. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=956.64s)]

*  I'm pretty self-critical about what I make. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=969.2s)]
*  Every season, I'm like, that was cool, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=971.36s)]

*  He's such good shit. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1034.48s)]
*  By the way, tatted up. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1035.6799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1036.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1037.84s)]
*  Oh, that's weird. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1039.52s)]
*  And like cool tattoos. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1040.6399999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1041.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  Like I don't know what they are. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  I saw him in Fight Club, but I was too busy looking at the V. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1043.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the V's were crazy. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1046.32s)]
*  To really take in any tattoos. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1047.12s)]
*  No. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1049.6799999999998s)]
*  So he's just a badass fucking stud. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1050.24s)]
*  He's a badass guy. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  He's cool. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1052.48s)]
*  Like he was really like, I would say the coolest guy I've ever met. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1053.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1057.12s)]
*  Yeah, look at his arm. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1057.76s)]
*  Look at his arm. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1058.56s)]
*  That's a cool arm. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1059.28s)]
*  That arm is cool as fuck. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1062.1599999999999s)]
*  Look at the veins. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1063.28s)]
*  That is cool. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1064.0s)]
*  He's got a bracelet. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1064.56s)]
*  You know there's some people that own their celebrity. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1066.48s)]
*  They walk in a room, they know all eyes are on them, and they're comfortable with that. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1069.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1072.24s)]
*  I saw Hugh Jackman do that once. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1072.56s)]
*  He just walked in, he started introducing himself. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1074.16s)]
*  And he knows everybody in the room knows it's fucking Wolverine. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1076.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's Hugh. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1079.68s)]
*  And there are some people that, you know what I mean? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1080.8s)]
*  They pretend that they're not famous and they do that thing. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1082.96s)]
*  We're like, hey, you doing it? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm Hugh. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1087.68s)]
*  But what are you going to do? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  I feel like that's like, how could you not do that as a famous person? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1089.68s)]
*  I would feel lame if I was Drake and I had the attitude of, you all know who I am. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1093.28s)]
*  But does he really need to be like, hi, I'm Aubrey to you? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1101.44s)]
*  Or what if he's just like, Dave, my man, how are you, brother? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  I know you know who I am. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1104.96s)]
*  I think it's different if both of us have, if we're both famous and we've been DMing, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1105.6s)]
*  and you know what I mean? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1110.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1111.68s)]
*  If I'm just a PA on set, I just think it's disingenuous, is that the word? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1112.48s)]
*  To be like, what's up, man? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1118.72s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1121.28s)]
*  I'd rather him be like, what's up, Drake? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1122.24s)]
*  I don't know why I'm talking from the perspective of Drake. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1124.64s)]
*  No, this is just an aspiration. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1126.8s)]
*  You come by and it's fine. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1129.6s)]
*  You come by and it's fine. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1130.72s)]
*  Okay, so he's in the room, so Pitt's in the room. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1133.68s)]
*  First off, the way I meet Brad Pitt. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1138.0s)]
*  Yeah, how did this come together? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1139.84s)]
*  Well, no, I met him on set. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1141.04s)]
*  I actually just cold emailed him. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1142.24s)]
*  What? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1144.24s)]
*  Yeah, really reckless. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1145.04s)]
*  I wrote the entire... [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1146.48s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1147.44s)]
*  Let me just finish one thing. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1148.32s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1149.28s)]
*  First, just know that when he actually came on set for the first time and I actually got [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1149.68s)]
*  to meet him for the first time, which is the first place I ever met him was when he came [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1152.64s)]
*  on set of Dave, we were shooting a scene where she was making a cast mold of my lower body, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1155.76s)]
*  so I had to meet this man naked, covered in slop. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1161.28s)]
*  That's how I had to be like, hey, nice to meet you. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1165.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1167.28s)]
*  Anyways, I knew... [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1167.76s)]
*  It's a power movie. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1169.04s)]
*  I basically... [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1170.16s)]
*  Kind of out of it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1171.04s)]
*  I heard through the grapevine that... [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1171.1200000000001s)]
*  And you never know how true any of this shit is, but I just heard that he was a fan of my show. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1172.8s)]
*  A friend of mine took a meeting at his production company and one of his executives was like, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1177.92s)]
*  oh, you know, Brad loves Dave, and my friend relayed that information to me three years ago. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1181.68s)]
*  And I stored that piece of information. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1186.24s)]
*  You hear that information and is your first reaction like, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1188.08s)]
*  of course, the guy's got taste, Brad Pitt, or are you like, oh my God, Brad Pitt listens to me? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1191.52s)]
*  Honest reaction. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1197.44s)]
*  My honest reaction is a combination of course, but also I don't know how true this information is. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1199.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1206.4s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1207.6s)]
*  It's more just I don't know how true this through the grapevine information is. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1209.84s)]
*  He should feel this way. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1213.2s)]
*  If he sees it, I imagine he would feel this way. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1214.32s)]
*  That's how he feels. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1216.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1216.56s)]
*  I love that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1218.4s)]
*  I love that. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1219.36s)]
*  But anyways, so we're writing... [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1220.56s)]
*  One thing I really pride myself on with the show is every season we end it in such a way where [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1223.52s)]
*  I think we make the best season finales possible. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1228.32s)]
*  And unfortunately, or fortunately, we just constantly raise the bar. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1231.2s)]
*  This season, I was like, how are we going to beat what we did for the... [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1235.52s)]
*  And I was like, well, I've had stored this piece of information about Brad Pitt. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  Maybe we go after Brad Pitt to the point where we started writing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1242.32s)]
*  We wrote the whole episode. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1245.04s)]
*  Before hitting him up. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1246.4s)]
*  Before even talking to him. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1247.28s)]
*  All my writers' room was like... [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1248.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1249.52s)]
*  They were like, that's crazy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1250.24s)]
*  Like, you don't even know Brad Pitt. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I know, but I just feel like if we come with the right idea, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1252.72s)]
*  why wouldn't he do it? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1258.88s)]
*  Everyone was like, all right, same thing with Rachel McAdams, same thing with Drake. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1259.68s)]
*  At least Drake I met and he was like... [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1262.88s)]
*  I love your show. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1265.2s)]
*  And I had face-to-face confirmation that it was real. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1266.0s)]
*  With Rachel and Brad, I just heard through the grapevine and I wrote them. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1269.2s)]
*  And this is not like a random celebrity cameo where you see them in a club and they're like, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1273.2s)]
*  what's up, Dave? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1277.5200000000002s)]
*  And it's really like the entire plot arc of the whole season was resting on Rachel McAdams, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1278.3200000000002s)]
*  Brad Pitt, and Drake. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1283.2800000000002s)]
*  And I didn't know really any of them that well. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1285.2s)]
*  I barely knew Drake, did not know Rachel or Brad. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1287.7600000000002s)]
*  Wrote the whole episode, got Brad's email. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1291.2800000000002s)]
*  From? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1294.0s)]
*  From an executive producer of the show named Marty Bowen who knows Brad's manager. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1294.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1300.0800000000002s)]
*  Got his email and I just got to work on drafting that email. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1300.72s)]
*  What's my email? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1304.24s)]
*  Like the words of it? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1304.96s)]
*  I couldn't even... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's long. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1308.0s)]
*  You're like... [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1308.5600000000002s)]
*  What is he seeing in his box? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1309.3600000000001s)]
*  Is your name in your email? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1310.72s)]
*  Is it Lil Dicky? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1311.7600000000002s)]
*  No, my email, I don't want to give it out. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1312.8000000000002s)]

*  the high risk procedure I've taken. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1417.04s)]
*  And then a few days later, he responded not in the same thread. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1419.8400000000001s)]

*  in response back for like 12 hours. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1435.12s)]
*  I read this email. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1437.1999999999998s)]
*  I kind of thought it was like junk or something. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1438.2399999999998s)]
*  Like it didn't... [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1440.8s)]
*  Because it was really vague. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1442.0s)]
*  I assume his email is not his name. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1443.84s)]
*  It's not brad at bradpitt.com. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1445.6s)]

*  He didn't like sign it Brad Pitt. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1458.8s)]
*  He had signed it BP and I just wasn't thinking... [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1460.2399999999998s)]
*  So when does it hit you? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1462.3999999999999s)]

*  Yeah, it was also cryptic. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1493.28s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1494.56s)]

*  I'm going to frame the email and put it on... [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1502.32s)]
*  Anyways, and then even then I still didn't believe it was real. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1504.0s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm hitting my agents like, is this his email? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1506.6399999999999s)]
*  They're like, uh, we're confirming it is his email. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1508.96s)]
*  Like they're like, I think he's in, he's down. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1511.28s)]
*  And then like on set, it was like such a joy to be like guys, like Brad Pitt is in the finale. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1513.6s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  But even then I still didn't believe it would really happen. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1519.36s)]
*  Because dates got to line up and shit. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1521.84s)]
*  Dates got to line up. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1523.36s)]
*  It's like at any point. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1524.24s)]
*  Did you have to move everything around to fit his window or? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1525.28s)]
*  We shifted a few things. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1527.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1528.8s)]
*  But it man, we have, by the way, this guy couldn't be more professional. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1530.0s)]
*  Like I designed the shoot in a way to where like if he want like it was long demanding days, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1534.0s)]
*  like we shot, it was like an hour long episode that we only had Brad for like, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1539.6s)]
*  he gave us four full days and we're talking like, wow, we're talking like overnight. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1544.4s)]
*  Like we're starting shooting at like 9 PM and going to like 6 AM. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1548.96s)]
*  What would that be fee wise Dove? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1552.8s)]
*  Four days of Brad Pitt. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1554.88s)]
*  He can name whatever price he wants. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1556.56s)]
*  He's doing it because he wants to. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1558.24s)]
*  Oh, no, of course he's doing the show business. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1559.28s)]
*  But like an eight star. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1560.72s)]
*  This doesn't happen. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1563.44s)]
*  Episode of TV. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like 30 years ago. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1566.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1570.72s)]
*  It was a great episode. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1571.22s)]
*  I gotta say the most validating moment of my life. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1572.16s)]
*  Prior to that, it was when LeBron James reached out to me and DM me about being a fan of the show. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1576.0s)]
*  But like working with Brad, and it's a shame that I live my life, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1579.6s)]
*  like just trying to impress LeBron James and Brad Pitt. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1582.32s)]
*  And that's how I find the peace and satisfaction. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1584.48s)]
*  It's not that most of us do. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1585.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1587.2s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1588.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1588.8s)]
*  But like him coming and then when he finally showed up on set and I was like, this is real. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1589.3s)]
*  And like I said, like shooting scenes, like, you know, you shoot his coverage, my coverage. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1593.44s)]
*  We always started with his coverage. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1597.76s)]
*  And I got the body double with the exact body type of thing. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1599.36s)]
*  And I'm like, Brad, like if you want to go home and rest up, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1602.3999999999999s)]
*  like we can use this other man's shoulder very easily. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1604.64s)]
*  He was like, never in a million years would I do that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1607.76s)]
*  He was like, that's not how it should be. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1610.16s)]
*  So real quick, just for everybody at home, explain like when you're shooting a show. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1611.6000000000001s)]
*  When you're shooting a show, yeah. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1614.64s)]
*  So let's say I'm here and Brad is like here. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1615.68s)]
*  Yeah, me and you. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1618.8000000000002s)]
*  So if the camera's on, Dave. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1619.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1622.0800000000002s)]
*  Sometimes you can do things called cross coverage, which is there's a camera here [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1622.64s)]
*  and a camera here at the same time. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1625.68s)]
*  That's really good for like improv and stuff, but it's not as good aesthetically. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1627.3600000000001s)]
*  You can't like light things as particularly to do it that way. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1630.64s)]
*  So you're better off aesthetically shooting one side at a time. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1633.12s)]
*  So I would always start shooting Brad's side. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1635.9199999999998s)]
*  Of course. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1638.0s)]
*  So that way. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1638.4799999999998s)]
*  He could leave after his coverage. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1639.1999999999998s)]
*  We got a body double because when we're shooting over Brad onto me, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1640.8s)]
*  all we need is his like flannel shirt and shoulder. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1644.0s)]
*  And we had a man for that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1647.52s)]
*  And but he was like, no, sir. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1648.08s)]
*  Like, respect. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1649.52s)]
*  That is fire. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1650.4799999999998s)]
*  He wanted me to feel. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1651.4399999999998s)]
*  I would never have that kind of energy when I'm giving my performance. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1653.04s)]
*  And honestly, it is true. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1655.76s)]
*  Like that is the right thing to do. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1657.12s)]
*  And those nerves are going to be coursing through your veins. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1659.12s)]
*  You're gonna fucking Brad Pitt. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1662.32s)]
*  And that's the vibe of like the reality of the scenes we're shooting is that like I am [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1663.9199999999998s)]
*  enamored with Brad Pitt. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1667.2s)]
*  So it would be easier for me to feel enamored. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  But it's an extra like it's not 30 minutes. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1670.08s)]
*  It's like eight hours or whatever extra that he's standing there doing that. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1671.9199999999998s)]
*  I assume. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1674.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1675.36s)]
*  It's like four, four hours. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1675.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's like in the dead of the middle of the night. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1677.12s)]
*  He could easily get. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1679.2s)]
*  He's got to come back the next day. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1680.08s)]
*  And like then and he man talk about a trooper didn't complain once. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1681.4399999999998s)]
*  Like it was just a joy. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1684.6399999999999s)]
*  Like a true joy. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1686.72s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1688.24s)]
*  I think it's smart for the super, super A list guys also to do cultural shows. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1689.44s)]
*  Meaning like when I say a culture show, I mean like it has the culture. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1696.1599999999999s)]
*  People are talking about it because it makes them look cool too. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1699.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1703.52s)]
*  Like how likable is Brad Pitt that he's a fan of the same show that you are a fan of. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1703.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1709.68s)]
*  And then he's part of it and you know he doesn't need the money. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1710.0s)]
*  He's just doing it to be a cool guy. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1713.6s)]
*  That much money. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1715.2s)]
*  Like I think that like TV's pay. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1715.9199999999998s)]
*  You've got to like legally give them some. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1717.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1719.28s)]
*  They're like it's not even like it's pretty surprising how low you know TV pay can be for [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1719.44s)]
*  even big time actors. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1724.16s)]
*  He didn't do it for the money. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1725.52s)]
*  He did it because he loves the show. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1726.4s)]
*  And I'm so proud of that episode and forever grateful to Brad for changing my life. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1728.4s)]
*  Now if you don't get Brad, did you have a backup guy you could reach out to? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1736.0s)]
*  I definitely had but it wouldn't have been the same. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1740.48s)]
*  And who was it? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1744.0s)]
*  There was no real backup to Brad to be honest with you. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1745.68s)]
*  Like I had people in my mind but like it just didn't feel. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1747.92s)]
*  Yeah yeah there's somebody. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1751.28s)]
*  Just tell him it's Ben Affleck. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1752.3200000000002s)]
*  No it wasn't. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  I love Ben Affleck. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1757.76s)]
*  I tried to get Ben Affleck in the Met Gala episode and he was like the schedule he was [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1758.48s)]
*  almost in. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1761.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1762.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah he was I had a great thing for Ben Affleck in that it's so validating to like pursue these [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1762.64s)]
*  icons. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1768.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1769.44s)]
*  With like a straight face. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1770.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1772.88s)]
*  And like they're and there's a chance they'll do it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1774.0s)]
*  I mean yeah that's amazing. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1777.04s)]
*  It's a really great feeling. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1777.8400000000001s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1779.04s)]
*  And I'm really thankful. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1779.92s)]
*  All right question I know you're heavily involved in the editing process. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1782.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1784.8s)]
*  Obviously acting you now how involved are you in the writers room? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1785.52s)]
*  I'm the head writer. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1788.88s)]
*  So just. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1791.04s)]
*  Couldn't be more involved in there every day like on the however you know we break [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1792.4s)]
*  basically every episode starts with like an idea like this episode we want to be trapped [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  in a hurricane with a conservative Christian family. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1801.6s)]
*  And those are typically your ideas or. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  Something it varies. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1805.12s)]
*  It varies. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1806.48s)]
*  I feel like back in the day season one it was mostly my ideas and then as time goes [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1807.6799999999998s)]
*  on I run out of ideas. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1811.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1812.7199999999998s)]
*  And we just make more and more different but it varies and once we have an idea then we [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1813.4399999999998s)]
*  got to like really map it out about just like breaking the episode and then we do that as [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1818.0s)]
*  a group we do it really well it's so fun it's my favorite part. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1822.48s)]
*  So it starts out as like one almost sketch concept. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1825.1999999999998s)]
*  Just a core idea. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1828.48s)]
*  And then extrapolate. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1829.52s)]
*  To the point and then we give the script off to a writer to write the first draft and like [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1831.68s)]
*  they're writing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1836.0800000000002s)]
*  Pros almost like not jokes or anything they're just like. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  No they're. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1839.6000000000001s)]
*  Story arc. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1839.92s)]
*  No the story arc is totally created in the room by all of us to the point where like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1840.72s)]
*  whoever's getting that draft to write there's really no room for deviation they're not going [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1844.0800000000002s)]
*  to like be like you know what instead of this thing I had them go here like they have a [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  very rigid thing that they have to like I'm going to go here second scene and in that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  scene I'm going to have a conversation with Gada and it's got to go like this they'll [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1857.68s)]
*  be able to make up you know good jokes and different dialogue. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1861.2s)]
*  They plug in jokes the structure is very set you guys plug in some of the funny stuff and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1863.76s)]
*  then whatever and then the script comes to me and then like I like honestly redo a lot [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1868.0800000000002s)]
*  of it and so I feel like the writing is probably where I'm I guess I'm involved in every phase [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1871.8400000000001s)]
*  I was going to say the most writing but I'm I've I have no other experience than making [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1878.0800000000002s)]
*  the show like as far as being on a set and like besides making Lil Dicky music videos [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1882.96s)]
*  this is the only way I know I've been told that I'm more hands-on than anyone like ever is. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1887.28s)]
*  Who teaches you the process of all this? Predominantly this man Jeff Schaefer who's [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1892.96s)]
*  yeah Jeff yeah Jeff so who's I mean Jesus you could listen to his credits but yeah yeah [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1897.52s)]
*  curb your enthusiasm the league like this guy's the bill Belichick to my Tom Brady like you know [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1902.8s)]
*  no network was going to like be like here Lil Dicky like we love your save that money music video [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1907.28s)]
*  here's the 30 to 50 million dollars. They need some security. Yeah so they brought in [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1913.28s)]
*  a guy to essentially babysit. So they brought him in that's fire that's well no I met with him [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1916.64s)]
*  then to bring him in I knew that I that I wasn't going to sell the show without having a guy like [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1920.8000000000002s)]
*  Jeff and then I met. You're Obama he's Biden. I like Belichick Brady. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  And then I love working with him. Belichick didn't move without Brady though you know even Biden did [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1934.72s)]
*  so true you got to think about that. Well I'm Brady Brady weren't without Belichick. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1938.4s)]
*  But when he's Belichick he's got hits though. I feel like Schaefer's got hits too is what he's [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1944.08s)]
*  Schaefer does have hits. Yeah. He's great. I'm sure you've been calling Schaefer Bozatano. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1949.36s)]
*  The best coach of all time. But wasn't the best until you had Brady. He was pretty good. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1961.12s)]
*  Kind of sucks without him. No he doesn't suck without him then he's been fine maybe it's a bad [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1965.36s)]
*  comparison. You're Brady which I think is the most important part of that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1968.72s)]
*  Phil Jackson. I'm Colby because he had Jordan. I mean he won over. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1974.48s)]
*  Colby's Phil or do you want to be seems like you want to be Jordan. No I like Colby. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1981.68s)]
*  Colby's good. Colby is my idol. Okay yeah yeah. So anyways it was I would never have been able to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  make the show without Jeff Schaefer like just simply having a guy I trust like having no idea [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1991.2s)]
*  I'm like very much like I question the way things are done all the time so it's really a relief for [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=1995.68s)]
*  like someone to be like no like it's not that way trust me and maybe like okay you make my favorite [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2001.2s)]
*  show ever. I can trust you as opposed to someone who didn't have that cache I'd be like why would [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2005.76s)]
*  I trust you you're just a man right in front of me. So Jeff puts you on game is basically like hey [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2011.28s)]
*  this is kind of how we'll construct the episodes and you're like oh that sounds good. That sounds [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2017.6s)]
*  good and then you know as time goes on I really like I think there is a huge tonal I call it the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2022.0s)]
*  I always say like you know every season I say guys I hope you're ready for a massive tonal shift. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2027.36s)]
*  That's what I always say because I just think tonally if you look at all three seasons they [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2032.72s)]
*  are very different and I think while being similar at the same time and feeling like the same show [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2037.44s)]
*  but I feel like I even my taste has evolved so much to where you know I look at a lot of season [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2042.56s)]
*  one there's a lot that I like about it there's a lot that I'm just like [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2049.36s)]
*  that's like a amateur hour compared to like what we're doing season three you know what I mean [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2053.6800000000003s)]
*  and it's really a product of like when I entered this whole thing I really saw myself with nothing [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2058.7200000000003s)]
*  to base it on as like the next great comedian you know with like truly just being everyone's funny [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2064.8s)]
*  friend and I always thought this show will be my launching pad for being a comedian when I say [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2068.96s)]
*  comedian I don't I've never done stand-up I don't mean stand-up I mean like the way Seth [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2073.84s)]
*  Rogan and Larry David exist on screen and their brand of comedy and then as things have evolved [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2078.56s)]
*  like I totally see myself as a filmmaker now to where like I want to be making you know what I [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2084.88s)]
*  mean like I look at guys like Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig and Ben Stiller you know Ben Stiller [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2090.32s)]
*  like carried like the best comedy things of like our childhood and then decided you know I'm just [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2096.56s)]
*  going to be the best director in the world and make like Escape from Dannemora and Severance [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2101.6s)]
*  and I really love that vibe. Oh so you want to move away from comedy? I don't want to move away [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2106.24s)]
*  from comedy because I don't think I should abandon that but I definitely want to make non-comedy [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2110.96s)]
*  things like I definitely feel like my future is not just making comedy like I want to make any [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2116.72s)]
*  specific genre you're interested in like I think horror fits so well with Jordan because comedy [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2122.3199999999997s)]
*  and horror are incredibly similar. Yeah well my no matter what genre I pride myself in realism [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2128.24s)]
*  you know what I mean so if I had to pick a genre I'd pick drama I guess you know I really love [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2136.8799999999997s)]
*  great dramas and great like I love movies like The Wrestler you know what I mean and and like [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2141.52s)]
*  movies that just like like I love like 824 you know what I mean and I always took it for like a [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2148.24s)]
*  Marvel guy I assumed you would just love Marvel. Yeah like Iron Man 3. You're like an Iron Man 3 guy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2153.6s)]
*  Yeah no I am. I am. That's what you like the most though right like his Marvel movies. Like what can you list [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2160.72s)]

*  there's being a filmmaker is just being like a leader of the set and like I saw this thing on [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2178.88s)]
*  Instagram the other day where Quentin Tarantino is like being a director like you don't have to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2182.72s)]
*  know how to do all the things you just have to know what you want and what your vision is and [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  hire the right people that can achieve your vision and be really good at eloquently explaining what [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2192.8799999999997s)]
*  you're going for and then the right people will be able to hear your words and then apply it and [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2198.8799999999997s)]

*  something that like the hardest lesson you had to learn along the process? Well there's I'll just I [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2255.44s)]
*  tell you what jumps into my mind. One is how time consuming it is. Like you know I can't even believe [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  what happens to my life when I make this show. Like starting with like the writers room and I'm [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2269.84s)]
*  not complaining because it is like what a privilege and a gift to make a show about my life that I'm [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2273.84s)]
*  in control of that. But like just the amount of sheer time it takes to put it all together. Every [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2278.4s)]
*  season is like an 18 month journey of like where I'm all in every day. Talk about post. Post is the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2283.44s)]
*  hardest part. Post is the hardest part with deadlines. Explain post to people. Real quick [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2289.44s)]
*  so post is just when the show is finished being shot you have to have it. Three phases. You write [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  it you write it for three months. That's the most fun phase. That's coming in with like a group like [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2299.04s)]
*  this. Jokes, ideas. We're smart and funny and we're learning about life. Then you shoot it harder than [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2303.04s)]
*  writing it because it's like you're getting picked up at like four in the morning every day and like [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2309.44s)]
*  you're working every day and you've got to facilitate all these celebrities. You're not just acting. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2313.2799999999997s)]
*  You're managing all these people as well. Totally. I'm like you know I'm working on the next [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2318.08s)]
*  of everything. I'm like I there's tons of decisions that need to be made and I have no problem [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2322.64s)]
*  being the person. I would like to be the person making the decision. But you also got to get in [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2328.8s)]
*  the character. Also got there's a lot of things. That's the one thing that I'm like lucky like [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2331.92s)]
*  with this the thing I think about the least is the acting. Like I put so much time and energy into [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2335.1200000000003s)]
*  the writing. The like the set like the just like the the tone like like how we want it to be shot. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2339.84s)]
*  Look and feel. That takes up every ounce of my energy and then I'll enter a scene being like huh [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2345.84s)]
*  like actually haven't even given this any thought as an actor but fortunately. You're just being you [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2349.6000000000004s)]
*  and that's written for like I know how I would react in a situation so I can just like [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2354.64s)]
*  live off my instincts. Yeah. Yeah. It'd be a lot harder if like Scorsese wanted me to play like a [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2359.6s)]
*  civil war soldier. Like I don't know what I'm doing. You know what I mean. And then and then [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2364.56s)]
*  so you finish shooting. Just tell us which side. North or the south. North. Good. Good. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2369.68s)]
*  But I like it's from Philly. Yeah. It's close. That Mason Dixon is right there. Okay. Look at [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2376.24s)]
*  the post post. Then you finish shooting the show and you're fucking you're drained. Like that shoot [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2380.4s)]
*  takes up every ounce of your energy and then guess what. Now you're close to that starts to air in [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2384.4s)]
*  like eight weeks and you gotta and once you're like they're not moving back the air date. So [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2388.8s)]
*  once once that first episode airs every week you're like locked into the schedule. And what [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2393.52s)]
*  has happened with my show is and it's not because I'm this like endless perfectionist who like needs [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2399.36s)]
*  to take it just takes X amount of time. Yeah. Here's what it is. Okay. Here's what it is. You [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2405.52s)]
*  tell me what you do in your my position like okay we have a scene. I would like to see every take. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2410.08s)]
*  Yes. Just so I know exactly the right. Exactly that. And so yes I could do it in a way where [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2416.08s)]
*  there's a solid take in the edit and I could move forward without but I would. But every time I [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2422.48s)]
*  look into it I then find a better take and then incrementally the show just gets better. That's [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2428.0s)]
*  the reason the show is so good is because I do this no stone unturned method which really isn't [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2432.16s)]
*  endless pontificating. It's just going through all the data and obviously having a right choice [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2436.56s)]
*  and just picking it and then I inch along and then I'll finish like four episodes and then the first [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2441.84s)]
*  one airs and then there's my time gets smaller and I'm handing in every episode like five days [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2446.96s)]
*  before this thing airs. And by the way not only do you have to lock the the edit then you got to [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2452.72s)]
*  score the whole thing which I'm so we have such great score and it's a huge part of the show. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2457.6s)]
*  I'm so involved in that. We got a color corrected. The music cannot suck. No. You're a musician. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2462.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The expectation is going to be high. Yeah and and the elevation too. I remember [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2468.32s)]
*  Entourage would just like the the score really elevated the show. They would have songs that [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2473.12s)]
*  were like out a week before the episode. Yeah. And you're like holy fuck. By the way and that's not [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2477.04s)]
*  even what I mean. That's the easy stuff. That's like yeah let me put this cool song in here. I'm [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2481.12s)]
*  talking about writing a song for original like I need like a great emotional violin piece for the [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2484.64s)]
*  scene where the character's crying and it's kind of like make it all work well. Right. Right. You [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2488.7999999999997s)]
*  know it's so there's a lot of different needs and then it's really so I forget the original [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2492.08s)]
*  question that was asked. Post and why post is so stressful. Is that you're on the deadline. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2497.36s)]
*  The timelines and like 10 straight weeks you have to deliver this thing and you're running out of [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2501.36s)]
*  time to the last and then by the end of it like the thing and then I just realized all 10 episodes [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2505.44s)]
*  just aired and I didn't even get to like watch them on TV or enjoy the feeling of people reacting [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2509.92s)]
*  to them because I've been like working the hardest I possibly could work to even make it to the season [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2514.3199999999997s)]
*  finale and then I arrive here. Yeah. Yeah. So the mark had a good mark had a good metaphor for at [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2518.64s)]
*  least what it comes to like building a joke and I think the same thing as you're building anything [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2527.44s)]
*  which is like you're basically creating a sword. Have you ever seen anybody create a sword where [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2531.2s)]
*  you're just kind of constantly banging on it. You've never seen that in like Game of Thrones [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2535.2s)]
*  or anything like that. I guess people like banging like exactly what I just said. You said no. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2538.96s)]
*  Okay. Okay. So the mark told her from. Yeah. Yeah. So but the idea that you're just constantly [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2543.36s)]
*  like whittling away and I think that is what you're describing when you're like I want to see every [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2552.88s)]
*  take. Yeah. Put that one in because I don't think people realize this a lot of times you'll hand in [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2557.04s)]
*  a movie or director will hand in a movie and they'll hand it to an editor that wasn't there [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2561.28s)]
*  while the movie was being shot at all. Yeah. He's a guy who's just getting all these footage and [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2564.8s)]
*  you know what he might have three other things he's got to edit. So he's like I'm going to do [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2568.4s)]
*  my best job. I want people to come back to me but I'm not going to painstakingly look through [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2571.6s)]
*  every single different cut to get the exact word etc. And if you do that it makes the best product [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  but it is fucking time consuming. It's so time consuming and it's really hard but it's my it's [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2581.7599999999998s)]
*  literally my name is that's the only line. It's called Dave. Like my life's worth the story of [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2587.36s)]
*  my life. Like I wouldn't feel satisfied or comfortable knowing I've left anything on the [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  floor. I'm happy to work this hard especially if I can get the result that I want. Yeah. I just get [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2595.44s)]
*  that. He probably understood that. Right. Yeah. He definitely is really militant in the edit too. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2600.8s)]
*  Yeah. He does. He likes to see all the takes and he does get that. You say you're not a tortured [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2605.28s)]
*  artist but there is a perfectionist. When did I say that? You said you're not like a perfectionist [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  endless perfectionist. You are in that like I'm listening to the new album now and then the first [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2613.1200000000003s)]
*  or second track I think you're like I hate all my old stuff it's all trash this is what it is. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2618.0800000000004s)]
*  And there's that such a I really admire that where it's like this kind of endless pursuit of [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2622.0s)]
*  always getting better and everything before is not as good as this and this is what it is. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2626.7200000000003s)]
*  I do think I am a tortured artist to an extent. I was just in the instance of why the edit takes [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2631.12s)]
*  so long it's not like there are certain things that like making music is way more anything could [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2637.6800000000003s)]
*  happen at any moment. I could say any line I can do it totally differently. When you have like I am [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2643.28s)]
*  so convinced that if I received footage for each like season three let's say I get all the footage [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2648.4s)]
*  and I edited the show and then you put a men in black like memory eraser thing on me right and I [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  forgot everything and then I received all the footage it would be the exact same algorithm [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2660.16s)]
*  because I really think that there is like there's always a clear cut choice for every moment and [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2664.7999999999997s)]
*  like one time you know my hand might be up here for the and then the line before it my hand was [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2669.52s)]
*  down here and then I'll pick well what line is more important and then I'll like back out of [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2675.12s)]
*  whatever is more important and make sure my hand is you know what I mean. You're going through the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2679.3599999999997s)]
*  same decision matrix for every single decision you make. Totally and I'm it's I have an opinion. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2682.16s)]
*  One thing I'm really like people you know it is it can be like it's a lot of work and like people [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2687.44s)]
*  that work with me whether it's the mixer like the editor they're like you're really turning over [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2692.56s)]
*  every stone here but I think that they respect it because I'm not waffling and I'm not like [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2696.8s)]
*  I don't know what to do I'm like I just when presented something an A or a B I definitely [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2702.08s)]
*  am gonna and unless they're really even I'm gonna have an opinion and even then it gets tough. If [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2706.6400000000003s)]
*  they were even then I would just focus for a bit. Then you bring it that's when I said it to the [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2712.32s)]
*  my most trusted writers and I say A or B and that happens and then I'll leave it up to the votes. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2716.32s)]
*  Yeah but the opinion having an opinion as often that often is like a superpower in and of itself. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  I think so yeah I think that's one of my strengths is just naturally having an opinion. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2725.28s)]
*  Sounds a lot like you because I remember if you're editing you're editing a stand-up clip [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2731.2000000000003s)]
*  even though he's not the editor he will be right there all night doesn't matter what time and it's [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2736.56s)]
*  like no no no yeah let me cut this little incremental thing it's like wow. I've heard [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2742.96s)]
*  stories of like other other shows. The snap system is great. Yeah you just it's timing it's like for [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2748.56s)]
*  me like at least with with stand-up there is a musicality to it so it's just like boom boom and [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2754.64s)]
*  the way that I can communicate that best to the person who is the master at editing it's just by [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2759.36s)]
*  either snap or like you know talking to them about I'm not going to learn how to use premiere. No why [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2764.64s)]
*  should you? You spent your whole life perfecting premiere I spent my whole life trying to be a [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2768.8s)]
*  great stand-up. Yeah let's work together but you know how to be like add eight frames of tail. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2772.0s)]
*  Yes and like you'd be shocked at how much like eight frames which you know there are 24 frames [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2776.72s)]
*  in a second you add eight frames a tail of a joke it changes the entire feel. And so his system is [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2781.04s)]
*  saying okay stop right now they'll they'll catch it that much later so I stole this from you it's [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2787.28s)]
*  when I snap that's when you stop. I don't have time to get through this sentence it's too late [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2792.72s)]
*  when I get through the sentence. Yes so with yeah so and then with like especially when you're [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2796.72s)]
*  editing comedy I think not even stand-up where there's an audience reaction comedy where there's [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2800.48s)]
*  not an audience reaction I think a problem that some editors don't pick up on is they will hold [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2804.4s)]
*  too long on the person who's delivering a joke as if there's like an expectation of a laugh. You need [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2810.1600000000003s)]
*  a reaction to think. But there is no reaction. Yeah but you can cut to if I'm saying something funny [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2816.32s)]
*  that's outlandish. And then cut to that person. That person is receiving the information and makes it [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2820.64s)]
*  funny. But some people go and tada and they're just waiting here and it's like now I feel [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2825.52s)]
*  uncomfortable as the audience. Cut to the person you're saying it to and now I feel represent excuse [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2829.04s)]
*  me I feel represented. So these little like tricks with you know because I'm always considering the [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2833.6s)]
*  audience I'm like how is the audience taking in this information. Yeah. If you create discomfort [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2838.88s)]
*  for them and you don't release that tension they're just sitting with their shoulders up. Yeah. I liked [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2842.88s)]
*  you to bring your shoulders up. I want you to feel that tension. We got to release it. Yeah. But yeah [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2847.2799999999997s)]
*  that's instinct. I mean you you know. Yeah it's just yeah. Do you think you have good taste? Yes. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2851.04s)]
*  Like taste and opinion for you is like kind of the same. I think it's. Yeah because I'm making [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2857.44s)]
*  my opinions based off my natural taste. But I think taste is like everything. Like you know again I have [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2862.48s)]
*  no experience in filmmaking. Yeah. But I definitely watch movies. Yeah. TV and know what I like and [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2867.52s)]
*  know what I don't like. And the more and more experience I get the more I'm able to actually [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2874.7200000000003s)]
*  be able to like execute these things. Yeah. See but at the end of the day like your taste is going [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2879.36s)]
*  to define everything you do. And I think I have good taste. Favorite movie. Oh yeah. Actually let [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2886.0s)]
*  me caveat that. OK. Favorite movie. Most underrated movie. It's a totally different question. Yes. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2892.8s)]
*  What's underrated movie. Like what's that hit movie that you actually like and you're like no no no. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2901.28s)]
*  This deserves more credit. I mean I don't. This isn't necessarily my answer because it's the type [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2907.6s)]
*  of thing I would want to put more thought on. Sure. What's the movie with Steve Carell. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2913.68s)]
*  40 year old Virgil. Crazy Stupid Love. Exactly. I knew. That's a real underrated. Is that with [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2918.8799999999997s)]
*  fucking fantastic Emma Stone. Gosselin. Yeah that's a great movie. Great comment. You know there's [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2924.0s)]
*  another one that I thought was really underrated. It was I think the Seth Rogen one with Catherine [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2929.3599999999997s)]
*  Heigl. Not Not Duck. Or no. The one where he's like she's like the president or something. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2936.16s)]
*  Wow. See it's underrated. I boycotted that one. Long shot. Long shot. Yes. You better believe it. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2943.8399999999997s)]
*  Those are. Look when you ask my favorite movie. Yeah. I which I think is an easier question for [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2950.3199999999997s)]
*  me to answer. OK. It's underrated. I think of Superbad. OK. I think of The Big Lebowski. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2955.04s)]
*  Oh. Lebowski's fantastic. Lebowski. I think of Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank is incredible. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2960.72s)]
*  There's a perfect example of like an incredibly popular and cherished film that lives up and [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2966.48s)]
*  exceeds expectations. For sure. But you know what else I think of and I think of like when [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2973.28s)]
*  you say like you want to move away from comedy and I'm like not necessarily like to me there [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2977.28s)]
*  be nothing more that I want to do than make like the next social network. You know what I mean. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2982.32s)]
*  Like that is a movie that I think is like of the utmost taste. It's contemporary. It's cool. It's [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2988.0800000000004s)]
*  real. Do you want to be biographical? No. Not necessarily. Like you know I wish I made the [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2993.6000000000004s)]
*  social network about the story of I mean I love the way that they did it. It's a perfect movie. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=2997.76s)]
*  But like that like making the social network is like in theory more appealing to me than making [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3001.92s)]
*  Forgetting Sarah Marshall even though I love Forgetting Sarah Marshall. And you would imagine [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3008.4s)]
*  that maybe my natural skill set is probably more inclined to dominate Forgetting Sarah Marshall. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3013.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. I mean I think I would do a great job making a great comedy and [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3017.6000000000004s)]
*  I do want to make great comedies because I think there's like a real void in the comedies. Like [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3020.5600000000004s)]
*  when I was younger and being an influencer. The R rated comedy. Judd Apatow was smashing us. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3024.1600000000003s)]
*  Every year was something that you had to go see in theaters. Friday man. Friday to me is a movie [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3029.84s)]
*  that as much hype as it gets is still in the ring. And there's something weird going on with comedy [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3034.0s)]
*  right now where like no one's doing. What do you think it is? I don't know. You know what I've [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3036.88s)]
*  heard that makes sense. I don't perform well at the box office. Yeah I've heard international money [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3040.64s)]
*  such an influence now in movies. Comedy isn't as international. Like a lot of jokes are kind of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3044.8s)]
*  if you're in America in the culture you get it and if not you're like I don't. But Marvel works [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3050.4s)]
*  in China. And Marvel you don't need to. Yeah. That's what they say. You just got to bend your [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3055.52s)]
*  knee to China. But even the comedies that get made I'm like. I think there's like this is probably [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3059.04s)]
*  perfect storm. Multi-faceted question because I'm sure there's part of you know the situation where [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3066.16s)]
*  there are people that are maybe scared to make edgier jokes at a time where remember films are [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3072.4s)]
*  two years out right. So everything in film is two years ago. Yeah. Right. So maybe it was a more [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3078.08s)]
*  sensitive time two years ago. Now things are kind of open up. You can say whatever you want and [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3083.28s)]
*  maybe in two years we'll have those films come back. Those R rated comedies come back. But I [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3087.28s)]
*  think there's a little bit of sensitivity from executives. They're like I got my kids in private [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3092.1600000000003s)]
*  school. I'm trying to build a pool in this house and build an extension. Do I really want to like [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3095.52s)]
*  roll the dice on my career with this like edgy movie that's got jokes about retards and trans [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3100.0800000000004s)]
*  people. I don't really think I want to do that. Let's just be safe with this Christmas movie. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3104.7200000000003s)]
*  So I think there was a little bit of that. Maybe. But I also do think that they were concerned [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3108.5600000000004s)]
*  about this like international box office thing. But the weirdest thing is that like everybody I [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3112.24s)]
*  meet that tells me they learned English they learned it from cartoons. Right. Which are all [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3116.3199999999997s)]
*  it's the Simpsons family guy. So you are learning English through comedy. So I don't subscribe to [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3120.3999999999996s)]
*  this idea that it doesn't travel. But you know it does travel way easier. Yeah. But I wonder like [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3126.3199999999997s)]
*  what 40 year old version did. Like I'm sure it was very successful in America and maybe it didn't [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3132.72s)]
*  travel that well. But I bet it made a lot of money. Yeah. You know. And just imagine Europeans [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3137.52s)]
*  like I don't get it. Yeah. How do you not have sex urge. Well I mean like think about when he's [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3141.68s)]
*  getting waxed and he's screaming out Kelly Clarkson. It's like. Oh you're saying the references [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3146.64s)]
*  they're going to miss a little bit. The reference is not going to hit in the Middle East necessarily. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3150.96s)]
*  Yeah. They're going to be like oh the girl who won season one of American Idol. That's hilarious. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3154.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean. Made 180 million worldwide. International. 27 million dollar budget. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3157.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean that's nice. That's nice. That's not bad at all. We're talking. But these guys are after [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3163.12s)]
*  15 years ago. Yeah. That's the thing. He was making our comedies. I think they will come back. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3168.0s)]
*  I also think there's less kind of for whatever reason people out there who are interested in [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3173.68s)]
*  making it's just like kind of a weird time. I think we're like there's just less comedians [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3179.76s)]
*  making movies or something. Yeah. That's fair. Did you finish writing your movie. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3184.8s)]
*  Me. Yeah. No. But I'm working on it right now. Oh yeah. Now is it topic. Yeah. But you can share. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3189.36s)]
*  I don't want to share it. Okay. Or comedy or comedy drama or can you give us genre at all. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3194.96s)]
*  And this is something I'm actively I actively consider as I write my first movie that I want [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3201.6s)]
*  to like be like my you know written by directed by starring me like my first real like boom. This is [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3207.68s)]
*  like the future of my career. I first off definitely a comedy coming of age. I would say that's a thing [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3213.44s)]
*  I'd apply to it if that and but no it won't. I don't want it to just be like a goofy kind of [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3220.24s)]
*  I want to have tons of heart be really real and I want it to ideally be the type of movie that you [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3224.56s)]
*  would consider in the best picture category just as much as you consider you know that's what I'm [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3229.2s)]
*  going for. But it's hard to straddle that line like it's like you know you want to make this like big [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3233.68s)]
*  epic commercial comedy and it's hard to do that while also like being this critical darling that [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3238.8799999999997s)]
*  ultimately that is where my taste lies like and I'm not trying to just like appease critics. I just [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3245.92s)]
*  genuinely like great art you know and I think a lot of the a lot of the great comedy movies like [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3250.56s)]
*  maybe take like the artfulness of the way it's shot will take a back seat or that you know [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3256.88s)]
*  I don't want that to take the back seat. I've kind of evolved to a place where I can't even enjoy a [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3261.84s)]
*  scene that I don't like the way the set design looks which I never thought I'd be that way but [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3265.84s)]
*  it's true. Maybe that's the reason why these movies aren't being made. What? Like just an [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3269.92s)]
*  instance that people are they want the comedy movie but they also want the art to be in it as [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3275.84s)]
*  well so it's like you're not getting. Maybe you're right. I do think the audience are getting more [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3280.96s)]
*  savvy too. They want it more elevated you're saying. Where it could be back in the day more [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3284.4s)]
*  slapstick silly fun but not as thoughtful. I mean I remember and maybe not even the audience maybe the artist [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3290.88s)]
*  wants that as opposed to the audience. I remember season one of my show when I'm like taking a lot [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3296.6400000000003s)]
*  of time to light certain scenes there are certain people being like it's a comedy. Yeah why are we [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3302.4s)]
*  working this hard? Who cares what it looks like? Yeah. And I'm like who cares what it looks like? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3308.88s)]
*  Like what are we we're making we're filmmaking. Yeah. Like how could you not care what it looks [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3312.1600000000003s)]
*  like? That's like almost the most important thing so I don't know but I'm I think there are some [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3315.92s)]
*  people that can do it all and I hopefully I'm one of those people. What does retirement look like for you? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3322.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh good question. Do you have to accomplish a certain amount of things in order to do that? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3329.04s)]
*  Do you even envision? No I kind of I'm like aware that I'll never be satisfied that like the go [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3337.04s)]
*  posts always keep moving literally you know I just did the thing with Brad but I feel like you know [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3343.68s)]
*  just as unaccomplished and like so I just think it's a never-ending thing like no amount of awards [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3348.88s)]
*  are ever going to change it and I know that and so I don't want even though I do care about like [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3354.48s)]
*  achievements and like I care about doing well and people receiving it well but I just know it's a [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3359.68s)]
*  never-ending cycle so I think retirement looks like the ability to be at peace with like the things [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3364.08s)]
*  that really like to not have my happiness totally wrapped up in the validation that comes along with [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3370.2400000000002s)]
*  my art like to be like very happy like not making something and not receiving all the flowers along [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3374.64s)]
*  the way and just living in the moment and like loving how the light is going through the window [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3380.48s)]
*  sill and the dust is like moving in the light. Are you happy right now? Yeah I am happy but I [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3384.96s)]
*  oftentimes I ask myself like am I happy or does everything go perfectly for me and I haven't [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3390.96s)]
*  really faced a lot of adversity in life and if I faced adversity I'd become depressed you know but [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3397.92s)]
*  I am every day I wake up really happy and I'm truly living my dream and I'm like but you're [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3403.68s)]
*  questioning this happiness because I just have a lot of anxiety in general but I think no matter [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3407.68s)]
*  what I think I'm the type of person that will no matter what's going on in my life I will always [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3411.2799999999997s)]
*  have x amount of anxiety to apply to anything and if I wasn't making the show I'd have anxiety about [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3416.16s)]
*  not seeing my parents enough before they die like you know what I mean like yeah it would just be [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3420.96s)]
*  and I just think that's how I'm wired and fortunately my anxiety like it only kind of fuels my ambition [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3424.7999999999997s)]
*  and doesn't like bring me down to a place of like where I can't get out of bed you know right like [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3432.16s)]
*  it's like functional anxiety that like propels me yeah semi-related is not anxiety but I think [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3436.08s)]
*  one of your superpowers is you can just vocalize the things you're neurotic about where most of us [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3440.24s)]
*  don't yeah and you're so comfortable doing that and it creates so much room for comedy and content [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3444.88s)]
*  in general just you're right being like oh here's what I'm neurotic about I'm just gonna let everyone [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3449.6s)]

*  us are wired to be like I hope people don't find out about this thing that I'm insecure about you're [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3457.84s)]
*  like let's just tell everyone yeah so you're an anxious kid that wants validation from [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3462.24s)]
*  strangers we could say strangers so you decide to become a rapper yeah [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3470.3199999999997s)]
*  I think at my core I was like like I live my life like that would induce so much more anxiety for [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3480.48s)]
*  most of us right one would think and it was like initially when I'm like oh my god I have to do a [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3485.2799999999997s)]

*  know I'm very confident and uh like know my skills but I think there must be like an insecurity in me [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3508.0s)]

*  and I saw lonely island Andy Sandberg and them just like dominating the comedic rap space with [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3556.4s)]
*  like everything they did was like millions and millions hundreds of millions of views and like [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3563.1200000000003s)]

*  have a monopoly over comedic rap and I was like I can do this what I can't do is write a sketch [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3569.84s)]
*  and like film it in like my San Francisco apartment with no money that like looks as good as the 40 [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3579.76s)]
*  year old virgin looks and like that's what our brain would compare like whatever comedy thing [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3585.52s)]

*  it's very DIY to begin with and I was like one of the main things that I did was uh I did this I [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3594.96s)]
*  used to work in an ad agency and one of the tasks I had I was the low man on the totem pole I was [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3602.64s)]
*  like I really like like I like gave like notes on the meetings and like emailed it out and one thing [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3608.48s)]
*  I had to do is this really boring report on how I work for the Doritos account on how our ads were [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3613.28s)]
*  affecting chip sales and I was the one time where I would send an email to all the partners of my [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3618.0s)]
*  agency and I was like this is my chance to get noticed for being special and I delivered the song [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3624.0s)]
*  I'm sorry I delivered the report one time that was like a boring word document that was like a [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3630.08s)]
*  template handed down from every assistant account manager before me I was like let's just like [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3633.76s)]

*  production wing and they have and like wait a minute I grew up watching mason puffy videos [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3654.1600000000003s)]
*  and thinking rap videos are this like unattainable multi-million dollar thing that eventually my [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3659.04s)]
*  career would kind of evolve into but wait we can just take one afternoon we can use these five [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3664.08s)]
*  canon 7d and we can make slo-mo yeah like and it looks like a real rap video and then everyone in [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3669.76s)]
*  my ad agency is freaking out over how much they love this funny song about chip sales imagine if I [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3675.68s)]
*  took my comedic thoughts and made funny raps about them and then I started making rap music [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3680.56s)]
*  with the intention of like maybe like the south park guys will see one of these videos and hire [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3686.08s)]
*  me to be in their writers room or maybe Seth Rogen will see it and then as I started rapping I just [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=3690.96s)]

*  filmmaker and i still have a rap career on the side that like everyone like knows me i think [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4137.12s)]
*  that's just cool but i don't i don't think my music career will ever e legitimize my filmmaking [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4142.56s)]
*  career i think it's just two different sides so you won't rap for us no no no i've seen so many [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4148.64s)]
*  i've seen so many freestyles for me do you know which one that really got me it was the one you [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4154.64s)]
*  were doing like a radio show in london or something like that it was westwood yeah now curious going [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4158.08s)]
*  into these things do you have a song specifically set up for that interview or not a song a freestyle [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4164.0s)]
*  snap of the interview yes okay yes that's that's okay and there's a misconception sometimes that [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4170.88s)]
*  i'm just making it all up off no no i know that you've written it but i wonder if it's like i [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4175.28s)]
*  have 10 i'll just choose one and go for it i'll go in there with like knowing exactly what i want [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4180.24s)]
*  to do god you got to execute it of course and yeah um it's nerve-racking to do like to do those [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4184.32s)]
*  things yeah break that down like what was more nervous westwood or sway sway because you probably [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4190.24s)]
*  built up york yeah yeah yeah yeah hip hop like you know like you like they they hype up like the way [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4194.72s)]
*  sway goes about his freestyles is like you're in like the hyena lounge you know like it's like [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4201.12s)]
*  you know like if you fail there like it's oh they're gonna like probably enjoy it you know [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4205.599999999999s)]
*  what i mean or just like yeah relish in the in the failure of it so i just thought like you know [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4209.68s)]
*  especially as a white rapper named lil dicky who like makes joke comedy music like you know you [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4214.4s)]
*  got to go in there and kill it and so i was so nervous oh my god i can't even believe i did it [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4219.76s)]
*  and then i did it again and i can't like it but it's probably like the the footage i'm most proud [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4223.76s)]
*  of that if i was like was like jay-z had never heard of me and he was like what should i watch [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4228.56s)]
*  first i'll check it sway freestyles how long does it take to write it couldn't i don't know i don't [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4232.320000000001s)]
*  know not two weeks preparation like what's your prep for that uh you know you got to find the [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4236.88s)]
*  right beat and uh i i write it i probably write it in like two days oh i thought that sway chooses [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4244.0s)]
*  the beat no sometimes he does it depends if you do like five fingers yeah oh that's yeah that's [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4250.56s)]
*  yeah okay so you're going in there and you're just adjusting it to whatever the beat is [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4255.68s)]
*  that's even trickier yeah yeah and then the westwood a couple days before but you're like i know i [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4260.64s)]
*  got a drop of fucking i love westwood i like remember seeing the old m&m freestyles yeah that [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4266.64s)]
*  was crazy i was just like i don't know i think i get more a lot like the sway and the westwood [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4271.28s)]
*  i was like on tour and like when i'm on tour like i really feel more like a rapper than i do when [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4275.44s)]
*  i'm just like sitting around so i just think i have a different energy where i'm like all right [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4280.5599999999995s)]
*  let's drop in there and like and kill it you know and just another performance yeah like i'm in that [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4284.4s)]
*  but the insecurity is about failing the execution it's never about the rap itself totally so you're [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4290.24s)]
*  very confident about the music yes it's just are you going to flub it in that moment live exactly [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4296.8s)]
*  that's interesting whereas most people would be worried about if their art was going to be [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4303.92s)]
*  appreciated by these people there's never a question if i properly execute we should be [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4307.84s)]
*  good to go that's how i feel but like look here's a story that i think is interesting [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4315.6s)]
*  like two or three years ago i was asked by the emmy's to do to be a part of the opening number [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4321.12s)]

*  if my mic was live and we're picking up that feed it was like [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4432.24s)]
*  it would have been like a failure on like a national scale yeah and then i finished it and [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4438.0s)]
*  i got off stage and i was like oh my god like did i just embarrass because in my mind i like [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4442.8s)]

*  and then i think i remembered it like right now i started to come in yeah wow [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4480.16s)]
*  that's genius because you can walk through the crowd too that you're even more hidden it's smart [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4485.28s)]
*  dude all i know is that experience has rocked me yeah i used to like imagine myself like i want to [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4490.88s)]
*  one day get to the place where i'm doing the super bowl i'm like no i just don't know if it's worth [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4499.36s)]
*  it like the the possibility of failure on such a giant's like succeeding doesn't really yield [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4505.5199999999995s)]
*  that much like i didn't get like that many like there's nothing really happened for my career by [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4511.76s)]
*  like successfully making it through that moment yeah and like failing would have been like i would [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4515.68s)]
*  have been known for it if it's not in your favor yeah i don't know i think like uh like if i can't [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4519.76s)]
*  control it at it i don't know yeah and maybe i'm a pussy and maybe i need to face my fears maybe one [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4525.280000000001s)]
*  day i will go on stage and my mic will be hot and it will be the grammys and i'll go for it that's [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4529.6s)]
*  what we were talking about the other day about like uh you know the more successful you get the [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4534.320000000001s)]
*  less you have to face your fears right you don't have to like totally you can exist you can edit [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4539.28s)]
*  everything you can sit take the time you can create a track you can take six months to put [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4544.96s)]
*  out if you want but sometimes the things you really want are right on the other side of what you fear [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4548.24s)]
*  yeah so maybe that's super bowl maybe you're telling yourself right now i don't need to do this but [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4552.8s)]
*  it could just be comfort yeah i don't know i i guess the more and more because that shit looked [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4558.32s)]
*  all right bro i thought it was gonna be a buck he's saying the best man speech while he's in it [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4563.12s)]
*  he makes up the words i just think the more and more that my career goes on and i feel like you [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4569.12s)]
*  know established and like i've kind of achieved things that i always dreamed of i feel more [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4573.84s)]
*  inclined to prioritize prioritize like quality of life and happiness but what is that to you what [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4578.48s)]
*  is that that's not like being like a month leading up to the super bowl being like oh my god i have [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4583.84s)]
*  so much anxiety about like imagine the month leading up to the super bowl when you're not [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4588.48s)]
*  performing on the super bowl compared to when you are nothing said i'm well aware that i'm [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4592.08s)]
*  nowhere close to i'm never going to be asked to perform at the super bowl no no i wasn't saying [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4596.96s)]
*  that i'm saying like even if you weren't going to be performing at the super bowl you're still [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4600.64s)]
*  going to be on the greatest coastline in the planet earth and going it's a little too rocky [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4604.08s)]
*  yeah so so what is interesting to me is that like you will choose your distraction from your anxiety [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4610.24s)]
*  yeah do i do you put yourself into film do you put yourself into music but you still need to [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4616.5599999999995s)]
*  choose something i'm gonna apply it somewhere you're right and we'll see time will tell i just [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4620.56s)]
*  know that uh man it's a it can be pretty stressful like like especially as like a rapper it's not [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4625.04s)]
*  like you know doing stand-up would be stressful too have you ever tried it no i never have tried it [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4631.04s)]
*  any interest yeah you've had imagined jokes you're like oh that would be a good stand-up joke uh i've [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4635.360000000001s)]
*  no and i am interested in trying it but i have such respect for the art form that i know it's [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4641.04s)]
*  well beyond just being a funny human being and it will require so much time and effort to [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4646.16s)]
*  for me to be the stand-up comedian that i would like hope to be yeah that i don't even want to [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4650.8s)]
*  try it until i'm ready to apply myself you'd have to feel publicly in the beginning that's [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4655.2s)]
*  yeah you have to feel publicly you're a famous person now so like you going up yeah it's going [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4658.72s)]
*  to be rough totally like i think when you say like what does retirement look for like i do crave like [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4662.72s)]
*  one stand-up special like at some point in my could be what i'm 50 like i would love to be able to do [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4667.68s)]
*  mix music and you know who did that well bow yeah bozo bow is obviously talented musician but he [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4672.16s)]
*  also had jokes and he could kind of mix the two and then he could use the music to kind of float [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4678.48s)]
*  in between the bits i could and i'll tell you there are like shows that i do sometimes that [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4683.04s)]
*  they're like corporate or like just like where it's you got some jokes in between and those are my [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4687.84s)]
*  favorite things where like i get to just chit chat in between like even as my favorite part of [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4692.5599999999995s)]
*  performing live is like not even pre-planning it but like living in the moment saying something [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4697.6s)]
*  like seeing someone react like actually being in the moment with the crowd even if it's a small [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4702.080000000001s)]
*  crowd but i also don't like using music as a crutch like you know what i mean like i do kind [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4705.92s)]
*  of want to just go up there with a microphone and just and do a stand-up special maybe use it in the [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4711.84s)]
*  beginning as you start to build your act yeah once you have it yeah now you're ready to go yeah [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4716.160000000001s)]
*  because i think that's a lot of times that's what like comics will do when they're trying to build [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4721.84s)]
*  a new hour they'll have like 15 minutes left over from their last and it's kind of a crutch [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4724.72s)]
*  yeah to get through this new stuff yeah crutches maybe there's a negative connotation but at least [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4728.8s)]
*  gets you there allows you to try the new stuff without just bombing the entire time but that [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4733.4400000000005s)]
*  could be cool yeah and also a very different experience for an audience like uh yeah if they're [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4737.92s)]
*  going there they're hearing hits but then they're seeing these like stories and you have punchlines [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4743.280000000001s)]
*  built into the stories and then there's you're right this is an interesting idea um there's a [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4746.96s)]
*  lot that i want to do i just i think i wonder i think i would i think i have a good skill set [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4751.76s)]
*  for stand-up comedy i just i respect the art form too much to just assume like as confident as i am [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4756.88s)]
*  i would if i went up and did stand-up right now it would not go well it's humbling stand-up sure [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4761.92s)]
*  it's humbling stand-up feel like any of your live concerts went poorly due to like the anxiety uh [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4766.4800000000005s)]
*  well my first concert ever didn't necessarily go poorly but i had never performed live in front [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4772.72s)]
*  of anybody like literally like the way the internet and everything works like i could [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4779.6s)]
*  create a following online behind a laptop and then all of a sudden have to like be a rapper in front [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4783.04s)]
*  of 2000 people and i just didn't know how to pace myself so i just the the adrenaline was so high [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4788.72s)]
*  for me that the first song i used all my energy i was gassed like the whole rest of the show it [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4793.84s)]
*  felt like i was like i just like i just need to survive i just need to survive this like physically [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4802.240000000001s)]
*  so i think everyone had a nice night that night but i remember like then the next one i had new [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4806.16s)]
*  york city and i was like definitely need to go less hard song one and i did and then like but i was [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4809.5199999999995s)]
*  really scared going into it like i was like i never perform will i be a good live performer and now i [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4815.04s)]
*  was like oh yeah very natural like i feel like i'm a great live performer but there's something [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4819.76s)]
*  about being a rapper where there's a whole different swag that is required where like [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4824.8s)]
*  if i even move my body in a corny way even if i don't fuck up the words but i just do a lame [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4831.2s)]
*  dance i'll be like scarred by that you know what i mean and like the internet will run with that [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4837.599999999999s)]
*  and be like what a persona is not trying to be the coolest yeah right you're like they might be they [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4842.48s)]
*  might think that you're doing it on purpose to be funny yeah i do i'm built to fail okay in that way [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4848.4s)]
*  i thought about that with the emmy's like if you went on there and you bombed people in the audience [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4854.96s)]
*  would probably be thinking it's a bit oh he's doing oh let me tell you if i ever do live perform [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4858.72s)]
*  again 100 there will be a built-in failure plan b where like if i fail in west philadelphia [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4863.2s)]
*  we will roll into the failure package it might even be better than what would have happened if [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4872.240000000001s)]
*  i didn't fail yeah you know but i will definitely have a plan for failure has anybody not liked your [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4877.84s)]
*  stuff like anybody you admired not liked it and what did that feel like a lot of people don't [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4884.4s)]
*  like little dicky the standalone rapper like especially like you know your elitist journalists [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4889.92s)]
*  who like you know or like you know how do you deal with criticism how do you like uh because [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4896.5599999999995s)]
*  let me just caveat this is you're a very confident person yeah i actually don't [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4903.44s)]
*  interpret it as arrogance i just interpret it as like confidence and you objectively almost like [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4908.16s)]
*  i analyze the facts at hand it's like it's almost autistic what a fire you know what i mean like [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4913.84s)]
*  you're like you're like this is the data and totally i'm i i would say that this thing is [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4918.88s)]
*  better than me honestly if i felt that way and i'm sure there's people you think are better and you [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4923.360000000001s)]
*  would just objectively say so i don't interpret it as an arrogance but that's like i'm sure there are [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4927.4400000000005s)]
*  people who might how do you deal with criticism uh i i try not to get wrapped up in it but like [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4931.84s)]
*  sensitive to it at all i am i try to avoid it really like i think like what i would do is like [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=4941.84s)]

*  into it and then get one over i love winning them over like i i would much rather perform on stage [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5006.96s)]
*  at a random festival where i am one act and i go out there and i see i just see the same kind of [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5011.599999999999s)]

*  what i what i crave deep down it will never happen what i crave deep down is like the [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5066.320000000001s)]
*  undeniable love and respect of everyone on earth yeah that's a worthy pursuit [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5071.2s)]

*  i think in terms of aspiration or whatever there is i mean the ceiling is the whole population of [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5123.2s)]
*  the earth which is growing the literal ceiling you know and as you know comedy doesn't travel all [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5130.56s)]
*  international you gotta figure it out it's gonna be learn some mandarin yeah i don't know but what [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5136.8s)]

*  you think because you put so much into the show or why i just think that with music with the show i [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5160.4s)]
*  like music really is a 10 000 hour thing for me where like i just like like i've i had a natural [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5166.879999999999s)]

*  don't know if you guys are aware of the context of it and i only recently am aware because i saw [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5247.84s)]
*  a comment that it was just on the internet and yeah yeah i think he was doing like a bar stool [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5251.28s)]
*  show and you guys both had a similar idea in the show right yeah he had it in something and [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5255.52s)]
*  the and then you had it on a podcast he said on a podcast yeah it was like a wooden shirt then you [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5261.280000000001s)]

*  it was totally built on a different idea that was about like a one single like a man whose entire [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5269.120000000001s)]
*  house was made of wood down to the clothing and then it ended up we ended up not going with that [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5274.0s)]
*  storyline yeah and then i'm doing one small really inconsequential scene of my series where a guy [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5278.080000000001s)]
*  was just selling wooden shirts yeah i promise you it wasn't i've never and i whenever i see [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5282.56s)]

*  understanding that like accusing a comedian of stealing jokes is like a major taboo and it's the [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5294.400000000001s)]
*  biggest yeah i was like just reach out to me and let's because yeah never and i have nothing but [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5299.6s)]
*  respect from what i see of his content online but i never have stolen any joke that's really my [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5305.200000000001s)]
*  immediate reaction yeah it's not like i'm not hurt by it i'm just like why would that why would [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5310.16s)]
*  he be so insistent that i when i never would right right two people can't have the same idea [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5314.0s)]
*  it's a pretty broad idea yeah the idea of wooden clothing yeah i don't know i don't know [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5319.68s)]
*  it's kind of specific the way you just said it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5326.5599999999995s)]

*  because i think a lot of times what would happen in these situations is you know both sides explain [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5343.68s)]
*  their part and then you go oh okay i see why this you know these two different comedians came to this [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5348.24s)]

*  things out that the possibility of two people having a similar idea is infinitely higher than [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=5381.76s)]

*  other person having this like insane self-belief in himself and like that being the soundtrack to [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7429.92s)]
*  my life and i believe that like you know what i mean like and i owe a lot to his art for like [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7434.16s)]
*  making me my attitude is probably formed by like early kanya and we had a great relationship he's [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7438.639999999999s)]
*  like he changed his number at some point like to the point where like you know he does that a lot [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7444.48s)]
*  i think where he changes his number he probably have to at that level changes his team um and i [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7448.4s)]
*  just lost touch with him for you know just the way and i haven't seen him in like four years and [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7453.76s)]
*  i obviously see all the things that uh and i was like surprised because like i don't think in his [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7459.12s)]
*  heart kanya uh dislikes jewish people you know i don't i know he knows i'm jewish i know he likes [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7464.5599999999995s)]

*  thing i'm sure i'm not denying that he'll say the wrong thing often you know what i mean like i [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7477.04s)]

*  the most is when people tell him what he can or cannot say so that he leans he leaned into it [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7484.48s)]
*  and that's the reality now i don't think you should be leading into it i'm not saying what he [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7488.64s)]
*  did is the right like i think that there should be a sensitivity to like jewish people you know you [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7491.4400000000005s)]

*  and i'm in there with both of them and i took the opportunity to be like fellas [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7599.12s)]
*  let me just tell both of you while you're here that you guys are so by far my favorite two artists [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7603.44s)]
*  of all time that whoever is third what a sizable gap there is between you two and the third play [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7609.28s)]
*  and that's how i feel about them like i think kanya was coming when i was a kid and i love kanya's [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7614.48s)]
*  music and like you know not only just the messaging behind like the ambition but also [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7621.04s)]
*  the musicality and like doing like that shit sounds better than ever and it's like so original [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7625.6s)]
*  and so great and drake came along right when i became like a rapper and like man nothing has [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7630.8s)]
*  inspired me more as an actual rapper and and musical artist than drake like that guy every [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7636.08s)]
*  time i feel like i'm like hitting a lull as a rapper and i'm like i'm like i don't know how [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7641.28s)]
*  much i want to go to the studio today because like i kind of am a little bit like in a writer's [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7645.76s)]
*  blocky situation where i'm not loving then drake drops like the most inspiring shit i've ever heard [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7650.16s)]
*  and makes me like totally and i just and both of them have been so nice to me so i can't really [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7654.16s)]
*  delineate between drake and kanya they're just my favorite artists ever i also want to know whenever [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7659.2s)]
*  you get into a situation like you're at like a party and there's someone that you really admire [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7664.0s)]
*  this there what is your protocol for how to interact with them because you're just a regular [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7667.599999999999s)]
*  now you're at these hollywood parties yeah uh i won't i will you know i'll try to have an organic [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7673.04s)]
*  you know i won't like be like angling the whole time like okay there's brad pit over there i'm [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7682.0s)]
*  going to go inch my way closer to him hope he sees i'm i don't i'm not really strategic like that but [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7685.44s)]
*  if i end up being in the same conversation look they either have seen my work and honestly if [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7688.96s)]
*  they have they probably really respect me and like me or they've never seen my work and i'm just a [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7694.24s)]
*  guy and i think everything i've done in my career has spawned off the premise of [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7698.8s)]
*  the way i behave in real life tends to be a way that people enjoy like i really just started as [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7707.68s)]
*  like an enjoyable funny conversationally pleasing man and that's how i carry myself so i just act [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7713.4400000000005s)]
*  the way i act with whoever i'm meeting not with like designs of like winning them over and getting [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7719.12s)]
*  them in my show but like i just want i you know the same way i'd want to be liked by anybody i [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7725.44s)]
*  try to be liked by whoever i'm talking to and try to be a charming version of myself and [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7729.12s)]
*  oftentimes it leads to positive creative synergy if later i'm like i have a great idea for this [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7733.599999999999s)]
*  person oh i met them at that one party like when i call them like i remember that guy he's cool he's [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7739.04s)]
*  nice he's not a weird guy a lot of artists are really introverted and like don't want to be [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7742.639999999999s)]
*  approached and don't want to be talked to i'm just not that way like anytime a fan comes up to me [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7746.5599999999995s)]
*  and talks to me like i find it minimally even if it's the most brutally awkward interaction ever [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7751.04s)]
*  i'm like what a unique human interaction that was that i forever remember the specificity of and be [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7757.12s)]
*  able to like mine comedy from yeah or they'll be like really normal and shower me with praise like [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7762.32s)]
*  either way i don't lose you know so i just think i approach everything the same way i'm talking to [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7767.68s)]
*  anybody and that i think is why a lot of these icons resonate with me because they can tell that [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7772.4s)]
*  i'm just being myself but you're comfortable complimenting them and telling them how much you [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7778.4s)]
*  admire them oh yeah like i know how much it means to me when drake and khanye tell me they fuck with [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7782.0s)]
*  me so i know how much maybe it'll mean to someone else if i tell them i mean who knows it doesn't [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7787.12s)]
*  mean anything to brad pitt but like i sure in my email to brad pitt i certainly said you have [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7792.0s)]
*  like totally defined like cinema for me for my whole you know what i mean like and it's true and [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7797.5199999999995s)]
*  i yeah the guys like brad pitt worked their ass off and that means a lot to them they want to [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7801.92s)]
*  influence a generation in a culture and i think they like hearing that like these new wave of [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7805.92s)]
*  people wouldn't be doing inspired for sure yeah yeah yeah i think yeah i think that makes a lot [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7810.64s)]
*  of sense i think there's sometimes people maybe in their discomfort with you know withhold their [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7815.52s)]
*  true feelings or admiration for the person that they're talking a lot of posture i don't posture [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7821.36s)]
*  yeah like really keep it real at all times and i think that is genuinely accepted like people [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7825.52s)]
*  like that especially if it's coming from a real place not like you're trying to schmooze them but [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7831.12s)]
*  when you really i don't know i've always felt that like when i really admire someone for a specific [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7834.32s)]
*  thing not that they're just the famous person around i really fucking admire them the conversation [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7839.2s)]
*  is so easy yeah because you have a million things that you want to say that are nuanced and specific [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7844.32s)]
*  and they can see that you actually care about the art or the thing that they're doing yeah and is [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7849.28s)]
*  the easiest flow in the world it's always uncomfortable like when i just don't admire them and i don't [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7853.759999999999s)]
*  care and in those situations i'm not gonna bother i don't care i'm famous yeah but yeah i think that [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7858.639999999999s)]
*  is good point lead with what you fucking care about i really think the core of my entire being [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7863.2s)]
*  and the success i've had really comes from being yourself like i think there's that's the reason [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7868.5599999999995s)]
*  that i'm able to be a white rapper making jokes in a predominantly black landscape because i'm [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJv5TEU5jc&t=7873.12s)]
