# White Lotus Saved TV, Drake Lawsuit Gets Worse, & Elon's Tesla Burning Terrorism
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg)
*  What's up everybody, welcome to Flagrant. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been brought to my attention by the internet, the glorious internet, that uh, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1.76s)]
*  my mom was caught outside of a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game recently. Take it away. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4.96s)]
*  I'm really sorry. I came all the way from Scotland. I thought the Leafs were gonna win. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Two games they lost. It must have been the fact that the guys were so overwhelmed at the size of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=15.68s)]
*  my massive chin down. They lost concentration. I am sorry. They let me sit on the bench. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=20.8s)]
*  That's why they lost tonight. They were overcome by Scottish pheromones. They didn't know what they were doing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=29.2s)]
*  They let her sit on the bench. I never understood where you got your confidence until that clear. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=37.28s)]
*  They might be the most confident people. They just don't give a f***. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=43.12s)]
*  Are Scottish women known for having huge tits? I know that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=47.44s)]
*  Most of the women, my aunt Edith Rest In Peace had huge tits. Like she looked like [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=52.16s)]
*  Groose. She had all upper body. It was just this massive upper body. But a lot of them [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=56.0s)]
*  start to get fat and then their just belly and tits become this one thing. It's just like [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=60.72s)]
*  something put like a square on top of their hips. They had to keep the f***ing Romans out somehow. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=65.44s)]
*  Oh that's fire dude. Oh man this girl is awesome. Yeah she's a big one. You know that there's like, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=73.76s)]
*  the Scottish are so uh, they have like such like a roasty culture. Yeah. They're like, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=80.32s)]
*  you gotta get, you gotta accept whatever the f*** you look like real fast. So if you're fat, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=84.48s)]
*  everybody calls you fat since you're a kid. It's kind of like Latinos a lot of ways. Like the fat [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=90.64s)]
*  kid they call you uh, they call you uh, flaco. What does that mean? Skinny. They'll call you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=95.2s)]
*  the opposite of what you are. I knew a Gordo. Yeah we have like a family name in India. So my [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=102.4s)]
*  cousin, they just call him Gulu which just means round. Just means round. That's just what you're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  named after. That's your name to everybody. So then eventually you become like 45 years old [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  and you've been a fat piece of s*** your whole life. You learn how to be funny about it and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=117.92s)]
*  endearing and then you just take over the internet. So shout out you miss. Yeah. Shout out you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Okay. I was playing tennis with the number one 14 year old in DR and she's like a little darker [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=128.32s)]
*  skin Dominican and they're like, hey nigga, I'm nigga. That's her name. She's the bicho ass. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=135.28s)]
*  Of course. She was nice. 14 years old. Busting everybody's ass. That should have been fun. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=141.04s)]
*  Black people really coming up on tennis huh? Yeah dude. Give us some time. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=145.6s)]
*  No you guys got that. What'd they call you out there? Shitty. I really was the weakest link out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=149.12s)]
*  there. It humbled me quite a bit. Do you have a tennis ball on your nail? I do. Oh wow. Tennis ball on the nail. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=155.84s)]
*  The shirt's gonna have a towel. You know what dude, I like it. You're like the gay version of her. Yes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  You're like that but for gay. I'll take it. Thank you. No because he doesn't want to have fun with it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=168.24s)]
*  He like. Oh that is true. Like she knows she got huge fat tits and she's a big sloppy girl and she [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  leans into it. Yeah. But you get a little sensitive. I think this is fly as fuck. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=179.52s)]
*  No exactly. That's the problem. She doesn't think she's fly. Like she doesn't really think her tits [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=183.44s)]
*  distract her. I think she believed that. She believed that. She believed. She said it with conviction. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=187.68s)]
*  We need to get you to that point though. We need to get you to that point where you're just accepting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=194.72s)]
*  Yeah if you were like I'm not good at tennis because there's no good homosexual tennis players. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=198.08s)]
*  That would be that. No there was Arthur Ashe. That's a deep cut joke. He died of AIDS? He's the one who died of AIDS. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=201.84s)]
*  And we named a stadium after him. Isn't that crazy? He got it from a blood transfusion dog. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  I think he got it from a deep cut. No did you really think it was a blood transfusion? Yeah [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=220.8s)]
*  this was like the 70s. They didn't even start checking until after he died. So there was just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=225.84s)]
*  some random gay guy getting butt fucked, cummed in and then going to Mount Sinai. Yeah because they [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=229.52s)]
*  didn't know back then. They didn't even understand what AIDS was until like what the late 80s? Who [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=234.96s)]
*  gives blood? Like I'm trying to like what's going on in your life where you're like I give blood. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=239.36s)]
*  Really? Yeah. I'm giving plasma. Yes I did the same thing. Do you guys have the fancy blood? Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=242.96s)]
*  No I don't but plasma I heard they needed and I was trying to be a good person. I gave up on that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=248.4s)]
*  shit don't worry. Man they see your blood and throw that shit out. Why is there so much lipid? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=252.32s)]
*  Why is it yellow? What is that? One blood transfusion type two diabetes a week later. A corn [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=261.52s)]
*  serpent. If anybody gets diabetes like Arthur Ashe that's me. That's my blood. RFK will ban [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=267.84s)]
*  your blood immediately. So what's going through your life when you did you was there like a call [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=275.6s)]
*  made like hey we need blood because there's a travesty. I had donated before and you actually [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=285.68s)]
*  feel better that first you feel kind of like shit when you donate blood but then I don't know you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=290.16s)]
*  start to feel like. I've done it too. I thought it was for like a credit or something in college. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Like I thought there was some sort of. I did that for 9 11 so everybody knew which team I was on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  That was important in my high school. Which team did you donate? You did it to the dudes in Afghanistan. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=301.04s)]
*  That visa took too long so I just went to the mosque and no I did it in my high school. They [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  had like a blood drive. Okay. I don't even know how. So they were milking 9 11 for blood. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=311.68s)]
*  You know nobody needs your blood in Texas. That's some fucked up shit. When I was in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  law enforcement they used to force us to do it like every six months. Really? You feel good [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  afterward though right? After like an hour? I just used to do it for the fucking chocolate and a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=325.36s)]
*  little time off from work. In my high school they would drive up with a bus. Five Jamaican [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=330.16s)]
*  ladies would be on it and then you'd go on you'd give blood and they'd give you a movie ticket [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=335.44s)]
*  and you got to skip class. Yeah. And so they were just milking. But you there were 15 year olds [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  going on this bus giving blood like three times a week. But that's sick you get a movie ticket. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=342.72s)]
*  Yeah. We don't do it for just to be good Samaritans. Yeah the movie ticket is 40 [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=346.56s)]
*  dollars they sell the blood for 600 dollars. It's like an insane amount. They sell it? Yeah. Yeah these [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=351.04s)]
*  buses are just selling it to the hospitals and they make crazy money on it. Oh I thought the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=356.24s)]
*  buses were from the hospital. That's crazy. They're like independent blood harvesters from children. Can someone fact check this please? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=359.68s)]
*  That seems insane. Okay so when Hollywood does it they're like these evil elites. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=366.08s)]
*  Jamaican ladies do it. Steal blood from children. Yeah the blood sled team. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=372.08s)]
*  Yeah dude it was wild and you got to skip class. So it's a private company that comes and makes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=378.72s)]
*  money off of it. I don't think so. That's what I thought. The American Red Cross does any shit like that I think right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=383.6s)]
*  Mine was just the big red bus that's what it was called. Yeah we're the big red bus. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=388.0s)]
*  And they would just pull out and you got to skip class. No parental consent form or anything. They go to Floridian's. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=392.0s)]
*  Yeah. See those motherfuckers would just go in a random red bus and just give their blood to anybody. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=396.32s)]
*  I wanted to start this as a business in college where you go to spring break locations, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=402.8s)]
*  pull blood out of people, then they get drunk faster and you get their blood. Wow. That's a win-win. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=406.96s)]
*  Oh that's a good idea. Right? Well yeah because with less blood your blood alcohol. Yeah you get drunk super fast. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=412.16s)]
*  People will die. Yeah well then more blood. You know it's just like it's kind of a perfect system. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=418.32s)]
*  Oh yeah do we ever drain the dead? What is the uh yeah like how long is blood good? Like if somebody dies [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=423.76s)]
*  we'll take their their lungs, we'll take their liver, we'll take their heart. As soon as they announce time of death they should take the whole. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=429.68s)]
*  Yeah like Dune just take whatever. Yeah I feel like that's uh. Why don't we do that? Are you an organ donor? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=434.16s)]
*  Let me check. That freaks me out. I said no. Yeah I think I said no. Y'all said no? I think I said no. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=439.84s)]
*  Because if you believe in the afterlife you don't need organs. It's a soul. Yeah but my idea of the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=446.56s)]
*  afterlife is that I got what I got. Like I'm gonna be whatever my shoulder still hurts in the afterlife. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=452.08s)]
*  Which is crazy. Oh yeah. They don't even have it anymore. Wow you're an organ donor. No no no. You gotta take that off. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=457.28s)]
*  So they took it off to New York license. Class D. What is that? They didn't. You're not one. Class T. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=462.32s)]
*  That's a physical vehicle. Oh shit. Al thought he was an organ donor and they took it off his license. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=468.08s)]
*  No no no. It used to say organ donor or not. Now it just says donor or not. Like I just got the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=473.52s)]
*  little heart there. Do you have a New York license? No I got the Texas but I'm sure it's the same shit. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=478.64s)]
*  Yeah I don't think I'm a donor. I don't think it's true. I don't think you're a donor either. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=482.8s)]
*  My mom told me not to do it. Hey wild guess here. Yeah I know. No it's class D. D is for donor. No. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=487.52s)]
*  No no no. That's the grade you got on your driving test. That's what I'm sorry. You're letting me drive a golf cart. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=493.92s)]
*  Yeah my mom told me not to do it because if I was on the operating table they said they would [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  harvest my organs. That's why I knew that was it. That's what my mom told me. They all say that like [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=507.76s)]
*  they're not gonna try to save you as much as if a doctor sees like a fresh pair of kidneys. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=511.44s)]
*  All right let this motherfucker bleed out. They don't see your license. They don't take the blood. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=516.24s)]
*  They don't take the blood. It starts to clot and it's they take it from the living people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=520.0s)]
*  They take it from the living people. But I'm saying if somebody develops that technology [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=523.5999999999999s)]
*  that's that's gonna save a lot of lives. Yeah and then we don't have to you know you don't [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  have to pull up to these kids in school. Yeah yeah. You sure they were making? They weren't like Haitian [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=531.68s)]
*  using that shit from Voodoo and shit? No they might have been honestly. They did a sperm donation [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=536.4s)]
*  bus right after it was crazy. Can we speak to that? All the high schools with lineups. It was a glorious thing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=540.9599999999999s)]

*  COVID shot probably because of the syphilis thing. No I mean for sure because of the syphilis thing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=644.48s)]
*  Absolutely. So they were just straight up injecting syphilis into black people? Into the pilots. Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=649.44s)]
*  And then telling them it was like medicine or something. Like what's gonna happen? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=654.08s)]
*  It's like let's just see. But why did they not think that you would just get syphilis? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=657.84s)]
*  Like what's the experiment? I don't know. They wanted to see the effects of it or whatever I guess [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=663.44s)]
*  instead of getting syphilis patients they're like well let's just inject healthy black people. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=668.0s)]
*  This is horrible. Wait a minute. It's so fucked. That's why you don't trust the government. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=672.3199999999999s)]

*  from the black people. We need a bigger data center. Yeah yeah yeah. They're like which race [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=684.0s)]
*  can survive syphilis? Is that, come on be honest, is that the idea behind it or did they like [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=688.7199999999999s)]

*  they were like this syphilis shit is crazy. Yeah. That was the take away. And the black people [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=736.16s)]
*  kept getting sick and they're like we're trying to give you medicine and it was just more syphilis. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=740.16s)]
*  Fauci was alive during this? Is that what you're trying to tell? Fauci did. Who was the Fauci at [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=746.0s)]

*  the bad whites under the bus. The fact that we don't have a Fauci that it was his program. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=755.76s)]
*  The Germans did it. Mendeleev and Hitler. We got the guys. You know the guys. Well we know about [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=761.12s)]

*  We need to throw them under the bus. Yeah that's true. We need to know who the Fauci was at the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=768.96s)]

*  We like it. Can you just be honest. You're the fucking prostitutes. You all got syphilis. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=790.64s)]
*  You're telling me the pilots. We got it from the white prostitutes though. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=796.16s)]
*  I mean that's how they got Capone too right? Didn't that Capone go down for syphilis? He did go down. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=801.52s)]
*  So maybe. He was also or something that it was maybe gonorrhea. Something apparently I was very [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=805.6s)]
*  easily treatable with like penicillin. Yeah. But he was so afraid of like injections or whatever. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=809.36s)]
*  He just died. Because Sicilians are black. That's true. That's true. All right. We're finally [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=813.76s)]

*  I knew that they were you know not using protection and they got something. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=830.88s)]
*  I knew something happened you know. But I didn't know there was a specific psychopath that was [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=834.96s)]
*  like hey let's just inject syphilis in them and then see if they get it. It was a government thing [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=840.0s)]
*  was it not? But I thought what they did is like they mutated the virus in some way and they [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=844.32s)]
*  thought that it would create an immunity to the disease. No you're right Akash. Okay. What study [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=849.76s)]
*  conducted between 1932 and 1972 40 fucking years by the United States. They figured that shit out [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=856.32s)]
*  after three years. Yeah yeah yeah. The United States Public Health Service and the Center for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=863.44s)]
*  Disease Control and Prevention the CDC. Wow. 400 African American men with syphilis. See who headed [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=871.12s)]

*  This is crazy. You know all white people get blamed for it. No white people just sitting around [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  hoping you get syphilis. They're probably hoping way worse things. They're really [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=885.44s)]
*  racist ones. They're not even satisfied with the syphilis. I'm glad you add that part. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=889.12s)]
*  The most racist white guys go let's give them this curable disease. Yeah. Right. So what kind of weird [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  mutated psychopath would even develop something. Was it treatable back then? No. By the end of the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=898.8800000000001s)]
*  study medical advances meant it was entirely treatable. So you guys. Not the beginning. Hold on. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=905.2800000000001s)]

*  Joey? The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=927.52s)]
*  So I think they specifically didn't want to treat them to see what happened. I mean that's the most [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=932.8s)]
*  fucked. This is just diabolical. We got to figure out. Taliaferro Clark? That's what I'm saying. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=936.64s)]

*  He looks like Prince Charles, to be honest with you. His name is Taliaferro. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=966.96s)]
*  Charles Taliaferro. Just because you say it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=970.88s)]
*  And his name is Charles. They're trying to ethnic it up right now to make it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=976.88s)]
*  But you always get a white name when you come to America. So they just fucking blame white people. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=980.0s)]
*  Yeah. This guy's a fascist Italian. Of course. You know what I mean? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=983.2s)]

*  love clothing so much that they're like, whatever. But the reality is, is they were Nazis. So they [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=996.4s)]
*  came here and they tried to do Nazi shit. That's not on us. White people just became white after [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  that whole civilist thing. Yeah. Sorry. Italians just became white. We never considered them white [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1006.24s)]
*  when they were doing this horrible stuff. It wasn't until black people got equality that they [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1011.5999999999999s)]

*  You said you had one of them. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1439.52s)]
*  Why are you saying one of them? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1441.52s)]
*  His dick got defensive. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1447.52s)]
*  32 years from now we're gonna find out if I ever have that shit. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1449.52s)]
*  No, I think I went and I was like, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1451.52s)]
*  I don't know, this shit feels a little warmer when I pee than usual. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1453.52s)]
*  And the doctor was like, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1457.52s)]
*  listen, you could just take these pills right now for gonorrhea and it will go away. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1459.52s)]
*  Or you could just wait and see if it goes away automatically. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1463.52s)]
*  But there's no point in taking the test to see if you have gonorrhea. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1465.52s)]
*  And I was like, alright, I'll just take them pills. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1467.52s)]
*  And it went away? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1469.52s)]
*  I think it did. I don't know. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1471.52s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1477.52s)]
*  You still have gonorrhea? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1479.52s)]
*  No, I took the pills. And it went away. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1481.52s)]
*  I think it did. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1483.52s)]
*  We'll never know. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1485.52s)]
*  That's the greatest thing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1487.52s)]
*  We'll really never know. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1489.52s)]
*  You can get tested and you can never get shit. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1491.52s)]
*  That's crazy. That was the prescription. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1493.52s)]
*  You just went in and he's like, yeah, take it anyway. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1495.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, yo, I'm peeing and it's like a little warmer by a few degrees than normal. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1497.52s)]
*  The doctors are so lazy. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1501.52s)]
*  They just gave me fucking antibiotics. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1503.52s)]
*  They gave you fucking antibiotics. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1505.52s)]
*  They're like, you got a cough, take some antibiotics. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1507.52s)]
*  They're just giving antibiotics, I guess. And it's like, we're good. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1509.52s)]
*  Just do chemo just in case. Why not? Just see. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1511.52s)]
*  This is one of the ones that you take the antibiotics. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1513.52s)]
*  Sometimes they're like, oh, it can weaken your immune system. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1515.52s)]
*  If I might have gonorrhea, give me the fucking antibiotic. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1517.52s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1519.52s)]
*  I was still fucking on that shit. Flamethrower. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1521.52s)]
*  You definitely weren't sweating gonorrhea. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1529.52s)]
*  You definitely weren't doing that. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1531.52s)]
*  You were holding that shit like Elon. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1533.52s)]
*  Were you nutting harder? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1537.52s)]
*  Oh, dude, the nuts were coming out, molten lava. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1539.52s)]
*  Spicy, bro. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1541.52s)]
*  Just chunks. Chunks. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1543.52s)]
*  That shit was coming out with chunks. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1545.52s)]
*  Speaking of which, I was holding my little baby over it. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1547.52s)]
*  Why are we talking about it? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1549.52s)]
*  That was a weird transition. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1551.52s)]
*  Chunks made a thing of it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1553.52s)]
*  Cheeto was coming out his dick and now he's going here. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1555.52s)]
*  Why are y'all thinking that? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1557.52s)]
*  That was such a weird transition. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1559.52s)]
*  You said speaking of which. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1561.52s)]
*  I'm junky, bro. I'm junky. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1563.52s)]
*  I was holding my little baby near the window. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1565.52s)]
*  He threw up onto the radiator. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1567.52s)]
*  There was a cover on the radiator. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1571.52s)]
*  It kind of went in, went through the grate all the way down. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1573.52s)]
*  The hot part didn't bring it up to anyone. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1575.52s)]
*  Then we went out of the house for a walk. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1579.52s)]
*  Then the radiator kicked off. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1581.52s)]
*  He came home. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1583.52s)]
*  It was just fucking cheese, dude. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1585.52s)]
*  The whole part was fondue. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1587.52s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1589.52s)]
*  It's cooking the vomit. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1591.52s)]
*  It's vomit hotter. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1593.52s)]
*  It's just milk. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1595.52s)]
*  How do you even clean that if you have a cover for it? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1597.52s)]
*  We had to get underneath it, turn it off, wipe it down. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1599.52s)]
*  Just me. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1601.52s)]
*  Just clean it up. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1603.52s)]
*  On my wife's birthday. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1605.52s)]
*  Happy birthday to your wife. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1607.52s)]
*  What did you get her for her birthday? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1609.52s)]
*  This is the most annoying thing. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1611.52s)]
*  I was like, what do you want for your birthday? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1613.52s)]
*  A thing that I could buy you. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1615.52s)]
*  She just said, you know what? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1617.52s)]
*  I would just love to hang out with you. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1619.52s)]
*  You're a horrible husband. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1621.52s)]
*  That's the most expensive gift. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1623.52s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1625.52s)]
*  That's the most expensive gift. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1627.52s)]
*  It's millions of dollars. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1629.52s)]
*  We love you. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1633.52s)]
*  We love you. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1635.52s)]
*  Pons, this is a podcast. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1637.52s)]
*  We love you. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1639.52s)]
*  But a chef would have been... [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1641.52s)]
*  You could have knocked that shit out in an hour. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1643.52s)]
*  Who knows what could have happened? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1645.52s)]
*  Who knows where I could have been career-wise? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1647.52s)]
*  I don't know if I told you this shit, but I was going to the Museum of Natural History at Shiloh. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1649.52s)]
*  Did I tell you guys this? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1654.52s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1655.52s)]
*  Going to the Museum of Natural History at Shiloh. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1656.52s)]
*  We go to park. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1659.52s)]
*  You were horrible. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1661.52s)]
*  That's fun to get it back. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1663.52s)]
*  We go to park. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1665.52s)]
*  We park almost right in front of the Museum of Natural History. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1667.52s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know if this shit seems right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1670.52s)]
*  My wife's driving. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1672.52s)]
*  She parallel parks. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1673.52s)]
*  She finally gets into the spot, which is wide open, but it takes her four or five tries. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1674.52s)]
*  She goes to pay the meter. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1678.52s)]
*  As she goes to pay the meter... [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1680.52s)]
*  You know I'm from New York and I don't trust parking anytime. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1681.52s)]
*  I see the meter maid walk past us. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1684.52s)]
*  I go, by the way, can we park here? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1686.52s)]
*  The guy goes, no, you can't park here right now. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1689.52s)]
*  I go, oh, Emma, we can't actually park here. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1692.52s)]
*  My wife looks at me and she goes, oh, no, we can't. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1695.52s)]
*  I go, no, no, Emma. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1697.52s)]
*  I just asked the guy who gives the tickets we could park here. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1702.52s)]
*  She goes, no, we could park here. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1705.52s)]
*  I look back at the guy, because I'm helpless at this point. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1707.52s)]
*  I look back at the guy, right? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1710.52s)]
*  I look back at the guy. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1712.52s)]
*  The guy looks at me. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1713.52s)]
*  He goes, good luck, bro. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1714.52s)]
*  He goes, good luck. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1720.52s)]
*  The guy who gives the tickets looks at my wife and goes, you can't park here? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1722.52s)]
*  My wife's like, that motherfucker don't know what the hell he's talking about. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1726.52s)]
*  But he knows that you're right either way. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1728.52s)]
*  You're in a great position, because either you move the car and you're right, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1730.52s)]
*  or you get a ticket and you come back and you go, oh, that's so weird. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1734.52s)]
*  We got a ticket. I wonder why. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1736.52s)]
*  Oh, he knows that I'm going to be fine. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1737.52s)]
*  And you're right again. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1739.52s)]
*  So he's looking at you like, hey, I got you. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1740.52s)]
*  No, he's looking at me like, man, what this guy got to put up with. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1742.52s)]
*  He's dressed like a police officer. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1745.52s)]
*  Yeah, what's called a meter maze is hilarious. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1748.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1750.52s)]
*  We are really disrespectful. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1751.52s)]
*  New Yorkers kept on to that? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1752.52s)]
*  Yeah, because fuck them. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1753.52s)]
*  They're all Indian. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1754.52s)]
*  They are. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1756.52s)]
*  They're the ops, dude. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1757.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1758.52s)]
*  They're all five. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1759.52s)]
*  They're Indian on the ops list. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1760.52s)]
*  They don't have one uniform that fits them. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1761.52s)]
*  Every meter made I've ever seen is in like a size 3X. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1763.52s)]
*  I've never seen an Indian meter made, but if you gave me a ticket. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1767.52s)]
*  They're all Indian. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1769.52s)]
*  They're all like, they're all Sri Lankan. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1770.52s)]
*  All the traffic cops are Indian and all the meter maids are in it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1772.52s)]
*  I've seen West Indian traffic cops. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1774.52s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1776.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1778.52s)]
*  West Indian. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1779.52s)]
*  All the disappointing Indians are meter maids or comics. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1780.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1782.52s)]
*  And their outfits are always too big. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1786.52s)]
*  And they just walk around and they have the big thing on their side and then they give everyone tickets. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1788.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's very annoying. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1792.52s)]
*  Bro, my wife has been girlmapping tickets where she's convinced herself. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1793.52s)]
*  Yeah, we've already done that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1798.52s)]
*  She keeps on doing this shit to me. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1799.52s)]
*  She's like, man, Uber is so expensive. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1800.52s)]
*  I've been like, what? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1802.52s)]
*  She's like, yeah, have you taken an Uber lately? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1803.52s)]
*  It's so expensive. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1805.52s)]
*  I go, yeah, I guess maybe it's gone up a little bit. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1806.52s)]
*  She's like, no, it's like crazy. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1809.52s)]
*  Like every time you get an Uber, it's like 35 bucks. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1811.52s)]
*  I go, 35 bucks? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1813.52s)]
*  That's pretty specific. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1814.52s)]
*  I go, I go. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1817.52s)]
*  Why are you saying that? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1818.52s)]
*  She's like, yeah, thank God. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1819.52s)]
*  Like that's why I drive everywhere. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1820.52s)]
*  Like, and then she's like, yeah, like even if I get like a ticket, it's actually like cheaper when you think about it if I don't take an Uber. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1821.52s)]
*  I open up one of my drawers. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1828.52s)]
*  I thought she was giving out tickets. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1831.52s)]
*  There was like 30 tickets in the fucking drawer. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1833.52s)]
*  And in her mind, she's like, but I'm saving money. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1837.52s)]
*  Look at how much money we're making. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1839.52s)]
*  This is money saved. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1840.52s)]
*  This is $5 saved each one of these tickets. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1841.52s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1844.52s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1845.52s)]
*  Even if you pay the shit off, eventually when you get too many, they just revoke shit. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1846.52s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1849.52s)]
*  They take your car? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1850.52s)]
*  No, your registration. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1851.52s)]
*  They'll revoke it if you get too many tickets yet. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1852.52s)]
*  But can I just tell them how Uber is so expensive? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1855.52s)]
*  What if I say that? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1858.52s)]
*  No, because they did that to me when I was doing that same girl match. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1860.52s)]
*  I used to do it back in the day. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1864.52s)]
*  I was like, instead of a parking garage, I'm like, yeah, I just get the $35. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1866.52s)]
*  I thought about that. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1869.52s)]
*  This is how expensive New York is. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1870.52s)]
*  The only difference of New York is it's actually cheaper to not do a parking garage and just [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1874.52s)]
*  get tickets and leave your car on the street. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1879.52s)]
*  I mean, I guess depending on how many times you get tickets. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1880.52s)]
*  Well, no, you'll get tickets the exact amount of times. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1882.52s)]
*  If you keep your ticket every time, once a week, it might be $60. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1885.52s)]
*  You're only getting two tickets a week, right? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1888.52s)]
*  Because you can't go Tuesday and Thursday. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1889.52s)]
*  So you get two tickets a week. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1891.52s)]
*  That is, let's say it's $60 a ticket, $120. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1892.52s)]
*  Four weeks in a month, what is that, $480? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1895.52s)]
*  So $480. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1899.52s)]
*  A parking garage like in Manhattan, it's $1,000 a month. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1901.52s)]
*  It's half the price to just get tickets. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1904.52s)]
*  So anybody that has a garage in the city, it's so your car doesn't get broken into. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1906.52s)]
*  And that's why New York picked up on game and they're like, no, you keep getting too many tickets. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1911.52s)]
*  We're going to have to punish you. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1916.52s)]
*  Have you seen the new thing where they don't even put a boot on you? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1917.52s)]
*  They just put like a blindfold on your car? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1919.52s)]
*  No. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1922.52s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1923.52s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1924.52s)]
*  I saw a boot last week. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1925.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1926.52s)]
*  No, the new thing apparently is like they just put this giant like mat that like sticks to your window [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1927.52s)]
*  so you can't see out the windshield and they can only get it off of the special solvent. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1930.52s)]
*  Well, that was the idea with the go. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1934.52s)]
*  Oh, probably because there's groups of people you can call on now to get the boot off. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1936.52s)]
*  I saw a guy drive the boot, break the shit, fuck up his own car, got out of there, dog. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1941.52s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1946.52s)]
*  You kind of got a respect. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1947.52s)]
*  You want to play a game? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1948.52s)]
*  The game is called Guess What Race He Was. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1949.52s)]
*  Was he part of the Syphilis? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1954.52s)]
*  Oh, this is great. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1955.52s)]
*  But I look at this, I'm like, oh, I could drive around that. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1956.52s)]
*  Like you pop your head out the window. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1958.52s)]
*  I think you easily can get away with it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1959.52s)]
*  I think that's the problem. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1960.52s)]
*  People start driving with their head out the window. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1961.52s)]
*  But do they track them? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1962.52s)]
*  They must have trackers or something, right? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1963.52s)]
*  Probably. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1964.52s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1965.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1966.52s)]
*  I took the boot off in college. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1967.52s)]
*  How? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1968.52s)]
*  I just took the wheel off, put the spare on. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1969.52s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1970.52s)]
*  I drove to where our campus security was and I was like, hey, take this off with the tire. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1971.52s)]
*  Oh, you took the entire wheel off. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1974.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1976.52s)]
*  When I put the spare on, I was like, oh, I'm going to get a boot off. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1977.52s)]
*  I'm going to get a boot off. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1980.52s)]
*  Oh, you took the entire wheel off. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1982.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1983.52s)]
*  When I put the spare on and I drove away, I was like, I have shit to do today. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1984.52s)]
*  Yo, Loki, how much is a new wheel? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1988.52s)]
*  I bet you a new wheel is cheaper. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1990.52s)]
*  Oh, I mean, if you do a Persian tire change. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1992.52s)]
*  What is that? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1995.52s)]
*  Where you rent the same car that you have, switch out all the tires and then return your [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=1996.52s)]
*  car. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2000.52s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2001.52s)]
*  This is why you can't have immigration, bro. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2002.52s)]
*  This is the problem with immigration. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2003.52s)]
*  You never heard of the Persian tire change? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2004.52s)]
*  No. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2005.52s)]
*  I wish I'd done that. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2006.52s)]
*  This shit is, no, this is silent right now. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2007.52s)]
*  Okay, this is. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2008.52s)]
*  Buddy G-Wagon, one day, buddy. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2009.52s)]
*  Just one G-Wagon. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2010.52s)]
*  No, this is. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2011.52s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2012.52s)]
*  Genius. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2013.52s)]
*  Because we don't even think about it because we're like good people. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2014.52s)]
*  If you come from a place where you don't get rewarded for being good, you go, okay, I'll [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2015.52s)]
*  just take advantage. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2018.52s)]
*  But also if you're screwing over like fucking, I don't know, some car dealer or some car [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2019.52s)]
*  rental. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2022.52s)]
*  Car rental people are such scumbags anyway. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2023.52s)]
*  They're people too, Mark. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2024.52s)]
*  Wait, okay. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2025.52s)]

*  Wait, why are these scumbags? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2037.52s)]

*  Alright. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2307.32s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2308.52s)]
*  That's saying early on, like one of the kids I think was saying like it felt like our whole [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2309.32s)]
*  childhood revolved around her wanting to film us and like that was what life was. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2312.82s)]
*  Like her being like we need to film this thing. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2317.32s)]
*  We didn't even have like our own life. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2319.1200000000003s)]
*  It's just her thing. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2320.42s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2321.42s)]
*  But then it continues to... [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2321.82s)]
*  And so then... [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2322.92s)]
*  ...devolve. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2323.32s)]
*  She puts one of the kids, she's like, hey, you don't have a bedroom. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2323.82s)]
*  You have to sleep on a beanbag chair. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2325.72s)]
*  Like one of the kids is like acting out. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2327.4199999999996s)]
*  He's not being obedient and like obedience is like the most righteous virtue within the family. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2328.8199999999997s)]
*  If you're not obedient, you're being of the devil. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2332.62s)]
*  And so she eventually links up with this therapist that starts working with the family to get the family to be more obedient. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2334.62s)]
*  You heard that, right? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2339.62s)]
*  She took the kids bedroom away, the bed away. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2340.62s)]
*  He had to sleep on a beanbag for months. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2342.8199999999997s)]
*  Like... [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2344.62s)]
*  What beanbag? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2347.52s)]
*  Forks or... [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2349.72s)]
*  We've all seen... [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2350.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2351.22s)]
*  A beanbag? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2352.62s)]
*  We've all seen what kind of father he is. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2353.72s)]
*  And for him to act like he would ever be like okay with anything remotely approaching this is so funny. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2356.22s)]
*  My daughter would never just... [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2361.3199999999997s)]
*  ...disrespect me. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2364.22s)]
*  Would never demonize me. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2365.12s)]
*  Would never be a situation like that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2367.52s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2369.4199999999996s)]
*  Okay, anyway. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2370.12s)]
*  Sleep on a beanbag. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2371.02s)]
*  I mean, if you manage to sleep on like a hard wooden floor, sure, but a beanbag is pretty sick. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2372.3199999999997s)]
*  It's kind of sick. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2377.12s)]
*  It's kind of chill. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2377.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  Beanbags are a pull. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2378.62s)]
*  That is better. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2379.22s)]
*  How old is the kid? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2379.8199999999997s)]
*  Like probably 15, 16? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2381.12s)]
*  I thought it was like a four-year-old or something. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2383.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2385.9199999999996s)]
*  15, 16. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2386.9199999999996s)]
*  That's the kid? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2387.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, he's a stud. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2389.4199999999996s)]
*  He's a stud, to be honest. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2390.4199999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2391.4199999999996s)]
*  But basically, she gets this therapist involved. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2391.9199999999996s)]
*  And the therapist is like kind of a man hater. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2395.22s)]
*  She's like man of the problem. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2398.22s)]
*  She gets her husband into therapy. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2399.9199999999996s)]
*  Also not like a real PhD. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2401.22s)]
*  Like what are they, licensed clinical worker or whatever the fuck? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2402.3199999999997s)]
*  Nonsense. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2404.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2405.72s)]
*  It becomes basically a cult. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2406.72s)]
*  Where like now she brings this girl, Ruby Frankie, into like her group and now is like her co-host on a bunch of the content. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2408.72s)]
*  And then she stops doing YouTube content and just like isolates the family, isolates the parents away, or isolates the dad. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2415.22s)]
*  So the dad gets kicked out of the house and the her starts hooking up with the therapist in their own house. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2421.22s)]
*  Who? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2426.22s)]
*  Ruby Frankie. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2427.22s)]
*  Ruby Frankie. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2428.22s)]
*  Oh, the therapist basically does a great job. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2429.22s)]
*  I think that was strongly alluded. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2431.22s)]
*  Is the therapist a male or female? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2432.72s)]
*  Female. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2434.22s)]
*  She's woman, man hating. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2435.22s)]
*  These Mormons are so easy to gay up. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2437.22s)]
*  Do you guys remember that horrendous documentary where the guy fucked the whole family? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2440.22s)]
*  What'd he say? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2445.22s)]
*  It's just a hand job or something? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2446.22s)]
*  It's just, oh it's kid stuff. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2447.22s)]
*  It's just kid stuff about a hand job to another dude. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2448.22s)]
*  Remember the guy who's disgusting but he had sex with the dad, the mom, and the daughter. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2450.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2454.22s)]
*  It was like horrendous. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2455.22s)]
*  Like if the daughter wasn't involved it'd be hilarious. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2456.22s)]
*  But he did do it to the daughter as well. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2458.22s)]
*  But there's something about, yeah, it's not just Mormons I want to say. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2460.22s)]
*  I think they're the most extreme example of Americans. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2465.22s)]
*  But I think Americans, since we grow up believing that we can achieve anything, we are probably [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2468.22s)]
*  the most gullible culture. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2476.22s)]
*  And I think this is why that we accept conspiracies so willingly. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2478.22s)]
*  Like there's another part where the government's obviously lied and these institutions take [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2482.22s)]
*  advantage of us. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2485.22s)]
*  Absolutely, of course. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2486.22s)]
*  But because we grow up and every single one of us is like, I'm going to be a millionaire [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2487.22s)]
*  when I grow up. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2489.22s)]
*  Of course I am. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2490.22s)]
*  I'm going to be the most famous person. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2491.22s)]
*  I'm going to be the most successful. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2492.22s)]
*  There's no version of us that is like, I can't go past my class. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2493.22s)]
*  I can't achieve these things. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2498.22s)]
*  We believe we can do anything. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2500.22s)]
*  So you could turn them into lesbians. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2502.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2505.22s)]
*  Like you could flip them. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2506.22s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2508.22s)]
*  But theirs is like religious. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2509.22s)]
*  Where are the cults? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2510.22s)]
*  There's cults that don't exist outside of America, right? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2511.22s)]
*  Where are there cults that are this popular? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2512.22s)]
*  Jim Jones was probably not in America, right? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2515.22s)]
*  He was in South America. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2517.22s)]
*  He started in America. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2518.22s)]
*  He started in America. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2519.22s)]
*  He's a motherfucker. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2520.22s)]
*  Got a crack in here, bro. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2521.22s)]
*  Make your bones feel. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2522.22s)]
*  Are gypsies considered a cult? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2523.22s)]
*  No. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2525.22s)]
*  No, but like Japan had a famous one. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2526.22s)]
*  They did the sarin gas attacks in the subway. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2529.22s)]
*  They had one cult. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2531.22s)]
*  What I'm saying is we have so many different cults. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2533.22s)]
*  We don't know which one drank the kool-aid and they all died. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2535.22s)]
*  There's like hundreds of them. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2538.22s)]
*  The most poppin' cults have religiosity tied in. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2539.22s)]
*  That's why the Caribbean, I think, they're slightly more believable on spiritual shit. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2541.22s)]
*  If you were to tell a Jamaican, be like, yo, I saw this guy was talking to me. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2547.22s)]
*  He flew. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2550.22s)]
*  I think it'd be a little easier to get a Jamaican guy to be like, wait, for real? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2551.22s)]
*  Every American would believe you in a heartbeat. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2555.22s)]
*  Have you seen the way the Americans react to mentalists? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2557.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2562.22s)]
*  Do you know when they go, and what you're thinking of is Debra. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2563.22s)]
*  And they're like, Debra, if you do that in France, they're like, ah, yes, you get some Debra. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2566.22s)]
*  OK, this is very nice. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2570.22s)]
*  There's no reactivity in Europe to that kind of shit. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2571.22s)]
*  They're like, oh, magic, OK, very nice, it's a good trick. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2574.22s)]
*  I think it's God. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2576.22s)]
*  I think if you grew up with a religious underpinning. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2577.22s)]
*  That's why I believe in demons, even though I don't. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2580.22s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2582.22s)]
*  We believe in everything. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2584.22s)]
*  I think God maybe is part of it, but I also think there's something like culturally, like pushing this belief in the impossible, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2585.22s)]
*  where I think there's like a restrictive belief in other like in Scotland, they're not believing in other shit. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2595.22s)]
*  Like when my mom grew up, it was like, hey, this is where you are. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2600.22s)]
*  You're going to stay right here. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2602.22s)]
*  And that is it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2603.22s)]
*  And you better accept it and love it. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2604.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2605.22s)]
*  This is like this kind of British class system that everybody lives in. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2606.22s)]
*  And you can go within this range. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2608.22s)]
*  But if you go out, you're a real if you're really putting an effort, you're a real keener. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2609.22s)]
*  Are they super religious in Scotland? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2613.22s)]
*  They're like tribally. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2615.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think in general, you can some people will take some specific random part of the Bible that's crazy. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2617.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2622.22s)]
*  There's demons probably talked about in the Bible. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2623.22s)]
*  And then that just becomes all what it's about. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2624.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2626.22s)]
*  So this one was literally Jody. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2627.22s)]
*  The therapist was like, I'm possessed by a demon. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2628.22s)]
*  That's why I need to move into your guys' house with all your kids. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2630.22s)]
*  Yeah, her house was possessed. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2633.22s)]
*  So she moves in with the family of eight people and is having exorcisms on camera. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2635.22s)]
*  They like film it. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2639.22s)]
*  The girl's like, oh, yeah, like doing an exorcism. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2640.22s)]
*  They kick the daughter out of her room. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2644.22s)]
*  So she gets a room in the house. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2645.22s)]
*  So she slowly like works her way into like a pretty good system. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2647.22s)]
*  And every time that like she wouldn't go, she wants or like it wasn't happening fast enough. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2650.22s)]
*  She'd be more possessed. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2653.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2654.22s)]
*  And then she gets up to the top bedroom and then she's having these these demon problems overnight. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2655.22s)]
*  So the wife would leave the husband in their bed. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2661.22s)]
*  Mind you, the husband went through hell in this experience. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2664.22s)]
*  He first got on steroids. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2666.22s)]
*  He didn't get juice, but he got incredibly fit because the wife, the original Ruby Frank, he was like, you're the man of the house. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2668.22s)]
*  You need to like be diesel. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2674.22s)]
*  I want to keep watching this. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2675.22s)]
*  Watch the who dog. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2677.22s)]
*  I see any of that. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2678.22s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2679.22s)]
*  Could this happen in Italy? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2680.22s)]
*  No way. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2681.22s)]
*  And they are Catholic. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2682.22s)]
*  Like I'm saying, could this happen in France? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2684.22s)]
*  No way. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2686.22s)]
*  It's not happening in Greece. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2687.22s)]
*  It's not happening anywhere else. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2688.22s)]
*  We have the first thing you pointed out was Mormons. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2689.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2691.22s)]
*  And it was the other one, too. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2692.22s)]
*  And this. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2693.22s)]
*  But I think that Mormons are the most extreme version of Americans. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2694.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2697.22s)]
*  It's like to believe their thing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2698.22s)]
*  Like, have you looked into their belief system? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2700.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2702.22s)]
*  No knock on the Mormons. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2703.22s)]
*  But it's some wild shit. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2704.22s)]
*  Like the Native Americans made it over to Jerusalem, then pulled back. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2705.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2708.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2709.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2710.22s)]
*  Jesus came to America. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2711.22s)]
*  Fire. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2712.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2713.22s)]
*  So it's like I think there is something in our DNA. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2714.22s)]
*  Maybe it is like maybe we are these risk takers from the rest of the world. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2716.22s)]
*  We leave the rest of the world, leave our families because we really truly believe that [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2720.22s)]
*  we can do anything in America. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2723.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2724.22s)]
*  So that type of belief system, which is amazing, is what America thrives off of, also lends [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2725.22s)]
*  us to believe anything could be possible. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2731.02s)]
*  And that's why you see these cults sprout up. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2733.22s)]
*  And I think religiosity helps. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2734.8999999999996s)]
*  I think we're splitting hairs. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2735.8999999999996s)]
*  I do. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2736.8999999999996s)]
*  I agree. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2737.8999999999996s)]
*  I think we're just disagreeing on the percentage. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2738.8999999999996s)]
*  That's it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2739.8999999999996s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2740.8999999999996s)]
*  That is part of it. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2741.8999999999996s)]
*  I wonder if cryptos is popular in Europe. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2742.8999999999996s)]
*  Like, I bet you it's not. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2743.8999999999996s)]
*  I bet you they're like, it's just letters. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2745.58s)]
*  There's no way you could possibly make. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2747.34s)]
*  And every American is like, this is the new fuck me. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2749.26s)]
*  I'm like, I watched one documentary on the Fed and I'm like, these motherfuckers. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2751.38s)]
*  It takes one video to flip the entire country. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2756.1s)]
*  How the fuck do they give us all this information? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2759.5s)]
*  Like, this is insane. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2761.46s)]
*  We are vulnerable. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2764.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2765.46s)]
*  I feel like where life is pretty good, I feel like you're not going to get into it as much. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2766.46s)]
*  Like, remember when we were at the pool in Arizona, we met those British people, they're [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2770.1s)]
*  crypto millionaires and like their teeth were rotted out and they're all in blow. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2774.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2777.5s)]
*  Crypto is a new thing, bro. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2778.5s)]
*  You guys go and get on it. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2779.5s)]
*  And I was just like, oh, this is the end. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2780.5s)]
*  We're looking at the end right in the face. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2783.5s)]
*  These fat British people like, yeah, we're putting all the money in crypto. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2785.5s)]
*  They're probably billionaires at this point. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2789.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2790.9s)]
*  Yeah, they probably made a lot of money. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2791.9s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2792.9s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2793.9s)]
*  Yeah, keep going on this. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2794.9s)]
*  So husband gets on steroids, he gets fit. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2795.9s)]
*  The husband just got really screwed in the whole process. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2796.9s)]
*  He's also kind of like a dumb, seeming guy, easily manipulated. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2798.98s)]
*  He's so in love with his wife. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2802.5s)]
*  He's like so cut out. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2803.9s)]
*  He just goes along with everything she wants. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2805.18s)]
*  And then so what the therapist does is genius. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2807.34s)]
*  She has a men's group. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2809.88s)]
*  This woman, Hildebrand has a men's group that they have to meet on Zoom every week. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2810.88s)]
*  And then they talk about the shame of like looking at pornography, lust and not loving [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2815.02s)]
*  and having sex through love, but through lust. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2818.44s)]
*  And she uses the husband as the beacon of hope. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2820.9s)]
*  She's like, oh yeah, the husband's been doing great. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2824.18s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2826.5s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2827.5s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2828.5s)]
*  Builds them up into this like godlike character. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2829.5s)]
*  And then once she gets in the house and she now wants the husband away from the wife, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2830.54s)]
*  she just every week starts to land into him. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2834.3s)]
*  For months she starts going, do you feel bad about your shame? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2835.98s)]
*  I know you're having lustful thoughts. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2839.3s)]
*  She starts attacking him, making him an outsider inside of the group that he used to be at [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2840.54s)]
*  the top of. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2845.1s)]
*  So now he wants her approval so badly. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2846.1s)]
*  So he'll do anything for this therapist. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2847.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2849.14s)]
*  I think he watched pornography one time that month and she's like, that's why there's [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2850.14s)]
*  demons in the house. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2853.7s)]
*  And then this is only in America. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2854.7s)]
*  We need to start like just being honest with ourselves. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2858.62s)]
*  We can be a little better about the demons. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2862.1s)]
*  Mark is one of the smartest people we know. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2863.9s)]
*  He believes in demons. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2865.1s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2866.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2867.1s)]
*  He's also the most religious person. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2868.1s)]
*  This guy's barely even religious. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2869.1s)]
*  Talk about the most religious person you know. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2872.1s)]
*  He doesn't eat sugar. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2874.94s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2875.94s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2876.94s)]
*  When was the last time you went? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2877.94s)]

*  But yeah, there's something about us, man. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2922.34s)]
*  We'll believe it. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2924.14s)]
*  And every single New Yorker thinks the Knicks are going to win the championship every single [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2925.14s)]
*  year. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2927.7000000000003s)]
*  Because we are. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2928.7000000000003s)]
*  Every single Dallas Cowboys fan thinks it's outside of you. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2929.7000000000003s)]

*  It allows us to create the greatest thing. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2935.62s)]
*  I think the delusion in America specifically is imbued with religiosity because of Manifest [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2937.1s)]
*  Destiny. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2941.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2942.98s)]
*  The whole point of America is like, yo, anything's possible and you can make all the money you [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2943.98s)]
*  want because God wants you to. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2946.66s)]
*  Well, can you explain specifically what Manifest Destiny is? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2948.14s)]
*  You can go west as far as you want and colonize and kill all the natives because that's what [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2951.94s)]
*  God wants. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2955.18s)]
*  Hey, hey, what did JFK say? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2956.18s)]
*  Was it JFK or was it Roosevelt? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2957.8199999999997s)]
*  Like, God is on our side. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2959.66s)]
*  Like, we're going to win this war. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2961.14s)]
*  Yeah, Roosevelt. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2962.62s)]
*  It was Roosevelt, right? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2963.62s)]
*  Yeah, World War II. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2964.62s)]
*  Yeah, it was like, I forget exactly how he said it, but essentially it's like God is [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2965.62s)]
*  on our side. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2968.5s)]
*  And we're all like, oh, what? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2969.5s)]
*  Fire. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2970.5s)]
*  All right, let's go. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2971.5s)]
*  Storm the beach. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2972.5s)]
*  And then the first line of Americans just got murdered and they're like, yo, God, you [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2973.5s)]
*  want to pull up? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2976.26s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2977.26s)]
*  You're a little late here. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2978.26s)]
*  God's on the third line. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2979.26s)]
*  No, yeah, God will come up. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2980.26s)]
*  But yeah, there's- [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2981.26s)]
*  That also makes sense with the Mormonism thing. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2982.26s)]
*  Like, Manifest, they are the Manifest Destiny religion. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2984.0200000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2986.0600000000004s)]
*  They're going west trying to find- [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2987.0600000000004s)]
*  American Prime Evil? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2988.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they're trying to- [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2989.0600000000004s)]
*  And they have some wild boys. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2990.0600000000004s)]
*  Yo, shout out to Mormons. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2991.0600000000004s)]
*  I know it sounds like we're back in the morn. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2992.0600000000004s)]
*  It's like incredibly impressive, like, what they've created. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2993.0600000000004s)]
*  Like, I think this idea of Mormonism is that there's these dopes and they go live in Ethiopia [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2995.0600000000004s)]
*  and then they come back here and then they kind of just settle in Salt Lake and nothing [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=2999.1400000000003s)]
*  really happens. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3002.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, that thing, what is it called? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3004.14s)]
*  Where they go for two years? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3005.7799999999997s)]
*  The Mission. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3006.7799999999997s)]
*  The Mission is like this beautiful- [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3007.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3008.7799999999997s)]
*  You basically get your business acumen locked in for two straight years, right? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3011.06s)]
*  You go, you learn sales in the toughest environment possible. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3015.5s)]
*  You learn another language. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3018.3799999999997s)]
*  You're trying to sell God to people who don't want it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3019.3799999999997s)]
*  Dealing with rejection of the most personal thing in your life? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3021.14s)]
*  The thing that means the most to you. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3024.02s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3025.3399999999997s)]
*  Getting smacked in the face and you're put in a lot of them like really tough situations. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3026.3399999999997s)]
*  So they develop that skill to deal with rejection. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3029.2999999999997s)]
*  They develop an amazing skill to sell and by the end of it, you're not knocking on doors. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3031.5s)]
*  You're running a team of people that are knocking on doors. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3036.7s)]
*  So they come out of that with this like understanding of how a business should function, learning [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3039.58s)]
*  another language and knowing how to manage other people in like really desperate situations. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3044.1s)]
*  So of course they come back here and they thrive and they become like the largest, what [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3049.1s)]
*  is it, landowners in America or something like that. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3051.98s)]
*  They run multinational corporations like churches. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3054.62s)]
*  And we just call them goofballs because they have some like weird beliefs, but they're [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3057.38s)]
*  all maxed. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3061.06s)]
*  They're both. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3062.06s)]
*  They're both. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3063.06s)]
*  They are both. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3064.06s)]
*  But like if you look at like Mormon business people, there's so many like the Mary Kay [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3065.06s)]
*  girls that do all the makeup, the MLM makeup. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3068.74s)]
*  That first girl was Mormon. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3071.86s)]
*  There's like a whole sub genre of like Mormon mom talk. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3073.22s)]
*  Like where it's just like TikTok influencers that sell clothing and makeup and shit. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3075.7s)]
*  All Mormon, all know each other. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3079.62s)]
*  Just like no shame regarding like selling themselves because they're like, yeah, bro, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3081.5s)]
*  I fucking go around and talk to people about Jesus. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3084.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3086.46s)]
*  I mean, jet blue, black and Decker, Sky West, Marriott. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3087.46s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3092.14s)]
*  I'm raising my kids Mormon. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3093.14s)]
*  I've always said this. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3094.14s)]
*  Son, Mitt Romney. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3095.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3096.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3097.14s)]
*  Bain Capital, the legend. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3098.14s)]
*  And who are we talking to? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3099.14s)]
*  We're talking to somebody about like how they justify that. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3100.5s)]
*  Because the idea I think with Bain, I could be messing this up, but you're essentially [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3103.14s)]
*  like taking over businesses that are in distress and then like building them back up. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3106.26s)]
*  And you've got to fire like maybe 10,000 fucking people when you do that. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3110.1s)]
*  And it's just like, how do you deal with that as like a Mormon, as a God fearing person? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3114.5s)]
*  Like you could negatively impact 10,000 people's lives. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3118.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think the justification was, yeah, but I'm saving the other 20,000 that work at that [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3121.22s)]
*  company. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3127.58s)]
*  And what would happen to them if the whole company went out of business? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3128.58s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3472.7s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3473.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3474.7s)]
*  She was sitting front row at the Maple Leafs game. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3475.7s)]
*  I almost fell asleep before I remember that. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3479.7s)]
*  So then basically for nine months, this woman and the therapist are raising the four other [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3482.7s)]
*  kids. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3488.7s)]
*  The husband's out of the picture, two oldest kids are out of the picture. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3489.7s)]
*  And then she just starts abusing the shit out of the two youngest kids. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3491.62s)]
*  This is where it gets super fucked up. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3494.7s)]
*  Who's abusing them? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3495.98s)]
*  The two of them together. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3497.58s)]
*  The two moms. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3498.58s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3499.58s)]
*  The husband's kicked out of the house. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3500.58s)]
*  He has no idea what's going on, but he's so brainwashed and was so pussy whipped over [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3501.58s)]
*  this girl that like on these calls, he just assumes he's the problem and everything's [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3504.54s)]
*  going to get better. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3508.18s)]
*  No check in with his kids. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3510.14s)]
*  I think his oldest daughter tried to text him. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3511.14s)]
*  Hey, hey, dad, just want to let you know I love you. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3512.58s)]
*  Thinking of you. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3514.8999999999996s)]
*  He hearts it. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3515.8999999999996s)]
*  And then one minute later unhearts it because he's so worried about, you know, it's like [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3516.8999999999996s)]
*  crossing his wife, essentially. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3520.7799999999997s)]
*  Even though he's already been kicked out for months, maybe a year. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3521.7799999999997s)]
*  He's like so worried about crossing the mom and losing her. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3525.1s)]
*  He said, like, I chose her over my kids every single time. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3527.7799999999997s)]
*  So moves the two youngest kids away from their childhood home into the therapist's house, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3530.2999999999997s)]
*  which is like on a compound far out in Utah. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3534.5s)]
*  It's a mansion in like the desert. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3536.8599999999997s)]
*  Like there's no one around for an acre, two acres, three acres. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3538.7s)]
*  And like the house is like retrofit. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3541.9399999999996s)]
*  It's got like bunkers underneath. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3543.8999999999996s)]
*  It's got like a safe with like a panic room. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3545.2599999999998s)]
*  It's got like food prepped for months. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3547.22s)]
*  How does she have money? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3548.9399999999996s)]
*  From doing this cult, basically. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3550.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, she basically runs like one of the best therapy situations. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3551.8599999999997s)]
*  And it's I don't want to say it's like the church isn't helping her, but the church is [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3556.22s)]
*  telling people you can go to her. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3563.22s)]
*  It was like a hustler's university for soccer mice. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3564.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3566.8599999999997s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3568.02s)]
*  And so the kids end up getting abused. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3569.1400000000003s)]
*  Like they have to like go stand in the sun. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3570.46s)]
*  They have to jump on a trampoline for like 12 hours a day. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3571.9s)]
*  They forced me to like run in like 110 degree weather. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3574.1400000000003s)]
*  And then at one point, they're just like bound with like ropes in the basement, just like [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3577.02s)]
*  tied up. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3581.02s)]
*  And the mom documents everything in these journals, everything word for word. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3582.1s)]
*  And the vlogs start getting darker. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3585.86s)]
*  Like if your kid is it is principle over everything. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3587.3s)]
*  If you basically if your kid has to die for the principles to work, then that's what it [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3591.2200000000003s)]
*  is. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3595.6600000000003s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3596.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like a more severe killer. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3598.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3599.46s)]
*  So the way they found out is that the kid, one of the boy that's tied up escapes from [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3600.46s)]
*  the house. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3604.42s)]
*  The therapist leaves the door open. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3605.42s)]
*  He escapes from the house, runs across the street, like all the way down the driveway, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3606.58s)]
*  like to the nearest neighbor, knocks on the door. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3610.3399999999997s)]
*  And then the neighbor shows up about to walk away because the neighbors, an old person [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3613.2599999999998s)]
*  takes him a while to get to the door. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3615.8599999999997s)]
*  Kid just kind of you see it on the ring camp. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3617.22s)]
*  He starts walking away. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3618.7s)]
*  He's like almost at the street. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3619.8999999999996s)]
*  And then luckily the neighbor opens the door and the kid is like, hey, can you do me two [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3621.94s)]
*  favors? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3624.94s)]
*  Kind of like what? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3626.02s)]
*  It's what are they? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3627.02s)]
*  It's and then he's like, can you actually I just need one. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3628.02s)]
*  Can you call the cops? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3630.82s)]
*  I'm worried about my sister and me or something like that. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3631.82s)]
*  The videos on a ring camp to the kids walks up on a ring. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3633.7000000000003s)]
*  Kind of heartbreaking to be honest. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3637.1s)]
*  Yeah, I cried watching the dad like this is an old man. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3638.1s)]
*  He's like, why don't you have a seat here? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3640.82s)]
*  Then I guess his wife brings out like a banana and some water. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3642.42s)]
*  The dad calling the cops is looking at the kid. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3644.86s)]
*  He's got he's like bound at the ankles duct tape on his ankles and all bloody emaciated, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3647.3s)]
*  like super skinny. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3651.86s)]
*  And then he just he starts crying. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3653.66s)]
*  This old guy just looking at this kid. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3655.3s)]
*  He's like, what's happening to these kids is awful. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3657.0600000000004s)]
*  And then apparently he has a sister in the house too. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3659.2200000000003s)]
*  So then I know SWAT comes in, raise the whole house fresh. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3662.02s)]
*  She's the sister and this therapist when she answers the door, she answers the door. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3665.1000000000004s)]
*  She goes, I'm on the phone with my lawyer. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3669.42s)]
*  Like already she knows she knows. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3670.86s)]
*  So this I would say this mom is probably schizophrenic. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3672.26s)]
*  Like the way she talks about demons and she says I'm on a mission from God. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3675.6200000000003s)]
*  These are things I've very, very like basic understanding of schizophrenia. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3679.1400000000003s)]
*  These are things that a schizophrenic person might think that like there's demons in the [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3683.62s)]
*  house and I'm on a mission from God, blah, blah, blah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3686.5s)]
*  This therapist is a dirty, dirty bitch. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3689.14s)]
*  And the dad is a cuck for just letting this all happen to me. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3691.46s)]
*  Like that's my takeaway. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3695.14s)]
*  So then basically go to court. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3697.02s)]
*  They both plead guilty to six counts of like child abuse and they both get like 30, 40 [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3698.48s)]
*  years in prison. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3704.18s)]
*  Oh, the daughter was in when they found the daughter. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3705.18s)]
*  She was like upstairs in a room like her hands like this. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3707.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3709.9s)]
*  Like her knees tucked against her chest and like a closet in the back. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3710.9s)]
*  The cop is trying to talk to her. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3713.62s)]
*  She won't speak like it's so sad. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3714.66s)]
*  So he's just like calling for whatever backup or like welfare or whatever. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3716.42s)]
*  See the CDC or whatever the fuck. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3719.94s)]
*  Oh, and people had been in Utah, her neighbors. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3721.62s)]
*  It's Utah. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3724.8199999999997s)]
*  They're probably all friendly with each other. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3725.3799999999997s)]
*  They were all concerned and they had called for welfare checks, multiple neighbors and [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3726.9s)]
*  the oldest daughter called for a welfare check. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3731.14s)]
*  I want a welfare check from my brothers and sisters. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3732.9s)]
*  I don't think they're OK. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3734.74s)]
*  And then the cops weren't allowed to get a search warrant because the judge said one [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3736.1s)]
*  of the neighbors asked or was asked, are there, have you seen evidence of physical [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3740.18s)]
*  abuse? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3744.58s)]
*  And because the neighbor said no, the cop was like, you can't give them a search warrant. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3745.22s)]
*  So this goes on for 10 months. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3749.06s)]
*  So it those kids, if that kid doesn't escape and they die, frankly, it's also on the judge [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3750.1s)]
*  for never once being like, you're allowed to go search, go do a welfare check. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3754.18s)]
*  And to be honest, this is I've had a like, we have a neighbor who says some crazy shit [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3758.1s)]
*  to their kid. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3763.2999999999997s)]
*  Like you're such you're a fucking psychopath, like nasty shit to the kid. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3764.2599999999998s)]
*  You're fucking insane. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3768.1s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3768.8999999999996s)]
*  We're hearing things horrendous. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3770.02s)]
*  We called we called. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3771.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we called Child Protective Services, CPS or whatever. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3773.22s)]
*  And then they were like, if you don't have evidence that the kids are being physically [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3775.7799999999997s)]
*  abused, there's nothing we can do. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3778.02s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3778.9s)]
*  So verbal abuse doesn't it doesn't count. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3779.38s)]
*  And they're all she was like the same thing they said to her lady on the phone. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3781.7s)]
*  Like I'm with you. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3784.98s)]
*  And the shit this mom says, I was going to go over and knock on the door and be like, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3786.18s)]
*  what the fuck is going on? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3790.02s)]
*  My wife is like, you cannot call. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3791.14s)]
*  See, let's call CPS. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3793.22s)]
*  Let's do this. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3794.3399999999997s)]
*  All right, but you cannot go over there. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3794.8199999999997s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to go check in on the kid and be like, yo, are you OK? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3796.58s)]
*  I hear what she's saying to you. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3799.38s)]
*  And she's like, dog, this woman is clearly crazy. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3800.1800000000003s)]
*  You have somewhat of a public profile. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3802.5s)]
*  You don't know what you could say about you trying to groom this kid or whatever. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3804.02s)]
*  So it's like you call CPS. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3806.7400000000002s)]
*  You try to do the right thing. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3808.1800000000003s)]
*  Nobody shows up. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3809.1400000000003s)]
*  Nobody talks to her. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3810.02s)]
*  Still hear shit. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3810.9s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3811.78s)]
*  And we live in like a nice building. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3812.34s)]
*  So what happens to that kid? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3814.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3815.62s)]
*  I see him. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3816.1800000000003s)]
*  I try to just be like, hey, what's up, man? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3816.6600000000003s)]
*  Everything OK? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3817.94s)]
*  He is withdrawn. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3818.58s)]
*  Head is always down. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3819.62s)]
*  And it's just like, yeah, your mom is saying horrendous shit to you. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3820.98s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3824.1s)]
*  Because I think if you call like CPS and you like lie, you can get charged with like fraud [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3824.58s)]
*  like actually it's a crime if you do some shit like that. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3828.74s)]
*  It's almost like slodding. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3831.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3833.14s)]
*  I mean, if you hear somebody that's verbally abusing a child, you should be able to. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3833.2999999999997s)]
*  They can't do anything about that. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3838.8199999999997s)]
*  But imagine if he calls and be like, oh, I seen her hit the child and he lied about that shit. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3839.94s)]
*  Then it's like he can get in trouble. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3844.02s)]
*  I mean, you could say you heard it. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3845.22s)]
*  What sounded like it. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3847.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3848.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, yeah, just the shit. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3849.46s)]
*  I can't even think of it because it's all right on spot and whatever. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3850.5s)]
*  But like the shit she says is just like we hear it from our room in an apartment nearby. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3852.9s)]
*  We're like down the hall. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3857.7s)]
*  People have been like talking to us like what the fuck is going on in there? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3858.8199999999997s)]
*  See, that shit scares the fuck out of me because that kid turns into a school shooter. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3861.3799999999997s)]
*  Truly. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3865.54s)]
*  That's the one too. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3866.02s)]
*  It's like head down all the time. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3866.98s)]
*  How old? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3869.22s)]
*  15. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3870.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, you could talk to a 15 year old. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3871.46s)]
*  No, I ain't talking to nobody. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3873.62s)]
*  He had a rule. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3877.7s)]
*  The strict rule. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3881.06s)]
*  What's his rule? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3882.1s)]
*  When you're in college, you can't talk to high schoolers. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3882.58s)]
*  They were good guys. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3887.7s)]
*  Oh, that's funny. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3889.14s)]
*  I also think though there's a conversation about all of these mommy vloggers. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3890.02s)]
*  My wife sees a couple of them. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3894.8199999999997s)]
*  Some of them will just have their kids like in the background of a video as a part of [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3896.02s)]
*  like, hey, here's a day in my life. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3898.74s)]
*  My kid went to whatever. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3899.7799999999997s)]
*  Some of them will make their kids the center of the video and there's an Indian girl who [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3901.06s)]
*  does it. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3904.4199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3904.74s)]
*  And she's just a daughter who's to me just an adorable girl, but she wears glasses and [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3905.14s)]
*  I know how this fucking internet thing works. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3909.3799999999997s)]
*  We all know how the comment section works. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3911.9399999999996s)]
*  My wife was watching it and I was getting like fucking furious before [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3913.8599999999997s)]
*  Justine got on TikTok and she was like, why are you so angry? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3917.06s)]
*  And I was like, dog, this girl is going to start seeing negative comments. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3919.7s)]
*  She's a fucking baby. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3922.66s)]
*  This is going to fuck her up mentally. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3924.1s)]
*  She has no consent in this. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3925.7s)]
*  Why are you putting her on fucking video? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3927.22s)]
*  Do you care about your kids at all or are you just so fucking talentless that you'll [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3928.9s)]
*  do whatever it takes to get a few views? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3932.34s)]
*  I was like livid about it. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3934.02s)]
*  The Ruby thing is crazy because she's forcing the kids to do stuff. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3935.06s)]
*  She's like, hey, act sad. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3937.54s)]
*  Hey, be sad in this one. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3939.7s)]
*  And the kids like, mom, I don't really want to do this. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3940.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think larger conversation, all them fucking parent vloggers. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3943.14s)]
*  If your kid is a center of a video, your account should be banned. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3946.18s)]
*  Well, did you see what happened? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3949.62s)]
*  Also, it's child labor. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3950.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3952.5s)]
*  California is legislated against this. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3953.22s)]
*  California right now just started a law where if your child is 60% of your content, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3955.14s)]
*  you have to put away a certain amount of money for them. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3960.02s)]
*  30% of income. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3961.8599999999997s)]
*  I like that. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3963.2999999999997s)]
*  And there's a bunch of people who are leaving California being like, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3963.94s)]
*  guys, we just don't like the lifestyle here. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3967.2999999999997s)]
*  We're going to Tennessee. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3969.3799999999997s)]
*  We're going to Texas. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3970.3399999999997s)]
*  We had mold in the house or whatever these like sort of excuses are. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3971.54s)]
*  But it's just so they can enslave their children and make content. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3974.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know the full details. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3977.62s)]
*  That shit is so gross. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3979.38s)]
*  Like this lady, she was giving them just like 10 bucks to be on the video. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3981.06s)]
*  She was like, if you help with the video, you get $10. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3984.18s)]
*  And she's coming home with fucking a hundred thousand. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3986.8199999999997s)]
*  She also left. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3988.74s)]
*  She saved all the raws. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3990.02s)]
*  So there's all these offcuts of her being like, do it different. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3991.62s)]
*  And then it being like, she saved all the raw. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3995.06s)]
*  So there's all this evidence against her. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3997.06s)]
*  You know what's funny about this is that there's a lot of people that [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=3998.5s)]
*  their kids just worked at the bodega or worked at the diner or whatever. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4004.98s)]
*  And that was just part of their chores. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4009.14s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4010.9s)]
*  And they didn't get their $10. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4011.86s)]
*  Maybe they might've got a couple bucks, but this is just your contribution to the family. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4014.1s)]
*  Like this is the family business. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4017.7799999999997s)]
*  Nobody has an issue with it. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4018.9s)]
*  No, I can. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4019.86s)]
*  But here's the difference. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4020.42s)]
*  Internet comments are the difference. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4021.54s)]
*  You go to school. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4023.14s)]
*  Nobody's going to be like, hey, look what people are saying about you working at the bodega. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4024.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4027.7s)]
*  This, if you or just some kid could go comment on the parents page and it's like, well, whatever. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4028.5s)]
*  I will say this though, like all the mommy bloggers, like keep that shit up though, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4033.22s)]
*  because they put out some good information. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4036.58s)]
*  Like learning, like if you want to know how to beat jet lag for your kid, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4039.62s)]
*  you could just type that shit into TikTok. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4044.2599999999998s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4045.9399999999996s)]
*  I love that. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4046.74s)]
*  You'll be the center of the video. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4047.3799999999997s)]
*  I think you're making a, you're defining it right. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4049.06s)]
*  That is a talent when you're describing. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4053.54s)]
*  Putting my kid in a video and talking about how cute they are. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4055.7799999999997s)]
*  That's the kid. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4057.7s)]
*  That's no different than like these stage moms that we hate or the kids that force the kids [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4058.2599999999998s)]
*  to be actors. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4061.9399999999996s)]
*  You're the exact same person, but now you're also the director, the executive producer. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4062.8199999999997s)]
*  You're just taking all the money and the next person won't be as insane as Ruby Frank. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4066.18s)]
*  She'll be smart enough to delete the raws. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4070.18s)]
*  I think slicing it in that when you're making your kid act for the content and especially [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4072.8199999999997s)]
*  emotionally manipulating them, abusing them like this, that's fine. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4080.02s)]
*  But no, no, I mean, that's not fine. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4083.4599999999996s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4085.3799999999997s)]
*  That's horrible and they should all go to jail. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4085.62s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4087.62s)]
*  They should go to jail. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4088.1s)]
*  But I see a lot of these mommy bloggers, they put out amazing stuff. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4089.14s)]
*  It's like, hey, my kid was doing this and it actually, this piece of this bottle can [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4093.22s)]
*  pop off and she almost choked. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4097.94s)]
*  Don't use this bottle. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4099.54s)]
*  And then you go, oh my God, thank you so much for sharing that information. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4101.14s)]
*  Just saying as a parent, there's so much useful information that a lot of parents, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4104.82s)]
*  they're saying which food has you allergic reactions, but it's not on the ingredient list. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4109.3s)]
*  Yeah, there's soy secretly and some shit. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4115.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4117.62s)]
*  So there's, I love the fact that information is decentralized, especially with parenting, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4118.26s)]
*  just as a parent, because I get so much of it. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4122.34s)]
*  But I agree with you, there's a different version of it where you're abusing the kid [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4124.26s)]
*  for content. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4127.54s)]
*  But the one, like you said, where parents are at the forefront, it's super helpful as a parent. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4128.26s)]
*  Before, we just had to go off a few parenting books and you hope those were good. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4132.9s)]
*  I'd rather go off of millions of people on the internet saying what was useful for their [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4138.0199999999995s)]
*  kids without exploiting the kid. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4142.98s)]
*  And I think a lot of them are good at some even like blur their kids faces out in them. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4145.14s)]
*  And they'll be like, hey, this tool for sleeping on a plane was really helpful. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4149.46s)]
*  We inflated this thing. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4153.62s)]
*  So I don't want to criticize those people because that shit is... [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4155.46s)]
*  One of her teenage, I guess now she's a teenager, getting her eyebrows threaded and like, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4158.1s)]
*  I didn't watch the video, but I know Indian girls, I know what the eyebrows look like. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4162.42s)]
*  I know you're inviting some comments. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4165.62s)]
*  You're trying to protect the kids from that online criticism, which is very different [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4168.98s)]
*  when their parents, they're just like offering information and advice. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4173.46s)]
*  Yeah, one's entertainment, one's information. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4178.02s)]
*  Yeah, education rather. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4180.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4181.62s)]
*  But like that shit is fire. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4181.86s)]
*  Like how to play with your baby. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4182.82s)]
*  Dude, there's all these amazing videos from like doctors. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4184.18s)]
*  They're not pediatricians, but they're like, they have maybe like a PhD in child psychology [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4187.78s)]
*  or something. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4191.54s)]
*  Yeah, like how to teach your kid how to sound out letters or how to teach your kid how to [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4191.94s)]
*  like say words before they can even really speak. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4196.26s)]
*  Yeah, I learned all this stuff from them. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4199.14s)]
*  Like this is amazing. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4200.26s)]
*  I remember the first time a girl left me alone with the baby. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4200.82s)]
*  She's like, all right, I'll be gone for like an hour and a half. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4202.42s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4203.86s)]
*  And I was like, what do I do? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4204.58s)]
*  She's like, oh, I was playing with them. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4206.5s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4207.7s)]
*  The reading, but like I was like, do I just like read them? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4209.46s)]
*  Like I didn't know what to do. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4212.18s)]
*  What girl left you alone with a baby? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4213.62s)]
*  My wife. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4216.58s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4217.54s)]
*  Yeah, you said that girl. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4219.86s)]
*  That was a little weird. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4220.66s)]
*  She was like, yeah, just play with the baby. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4221.86s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4223.38s)]
*  So I like looked at the video and was like, oh no, like put some water in a pan, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4224.34s)]
*  let him splash in it. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4227.14s)]

*  That's great. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4230.18s)]
*  That's informational, like you said. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4231.3s)]
*  Even if it's entertainment, that is, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4232.42s)]
*  even if it was you getting on camera and complaining about your kids, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4234.099999999999s)]
*  but your kids aren't in the videos, they're blurred out. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4236.66s)]
*  I'm not even saying this is a shot at him. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4239.219999999999s)]
*  That's what Luis CK did. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4240.34s)]
*  But you don't know who the kids are. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4242.0199999999995s)]
*  He protects their identity. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4243.139999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4244.179999999999s)]
*  That's entertaining. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4244.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I think that's a good slice. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4245.3s)]
*  Yeah, but what gets the views? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4246.9s)]
*  And they knew that the son and the oldest daughter got the views, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4248.34s)]

*  I need something fun and I need something light. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4262.82s)]
*  How about Jonathan Majors beating the shit out of his girl? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4264.74s)]
*  We need something fun and light. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4268.1s)]
*  Bro, the emotional manipulation that he is capable of. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4270.66s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4273.62s)]
*  I need you to read verbatim what happened in the transcript. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4275.3s)]
*  Yeah, can you fill me in on this story? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4278.5s)]
*  So Jonathan Majors' audio, you know he's been accused of... [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4280.9s)]
*  I know all the old shit. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4283.3s)]
*  So audio leaked of a conversation of him with said woman. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4284.26s)]
*  He says, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4288.74s)]
*  I'm ashamed I've ever... [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4289.219999999999s)]
*  Majors begins before cutting himself off, cuts himself off. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4290.5s)]
*  I go, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4293.139999999999s)]
*  I'm ashamed I've ever... [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4293.54s)]
*  I've never been aggressive with a woman before. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4294.82s)]

*  He goes, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4303.139999999999s)]
*  Yes, all of those things are under-aggressed. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4303.86s)]
*  That's never happened to me. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4306.42s)]
*  Because I said something sarcastically in your eyes, she said. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4309.219999999999s)]
*  And he said, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4312.259999999999s)]
*  Well, clearly it's more than that. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4312.82s)]
*  And then she goes, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4314.42s)]
*  Something inside of you. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4315.139999999999s)]
*  And then he goes, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4316.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, towards you. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4316.74s)]
*  Yo, son. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4318.74s)]
*  Son, he just blamed her for choking the shit out of her. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4320.74s)]
*  This guy, you need to bury this motherfucker under the jail. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4324.5s)]
*  Now here's the question. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4327.94s)]
*  Aggressed? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4328.9s)]
*  I need to know the timeline. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4330.0199999999995s)]
*  What's crazy, there was rumors of maybe Marvel bringing him back in. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4332.0199999999995s)]
*  And... [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4335.86s)]
*  They waited. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4337.0599999999995s)]
*  They sat on that audio. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4337.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4338.58s)]
*  I think they waited for these rumors. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4338.9s)]
*  People were defending his ass. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4340.34s)]
*  And I think the chick is white, right? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4342.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4343.78s)]
*  You know, so... [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4344.58s)]
*  Mistake number one. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4345.139999999999s)]
*  Snowbunny. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4347.7s)]
*  Mistake number one. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4348.26s)]
*  Yo, where's Dr. Umar? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4349.46s)]
*  Where is Dr. Umar when you need him? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4350.42s)]
*  Dr. Kumar is here. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4352.74s)]
*  Mistake number one. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4355.94s)]
*  That's because the video came out. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4358.179999999999s)]
*  She had his phone. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4359.7s)]
*  It's like, you know, you should take people's property. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4360.66s)]
*  And what was the video of him running away from her? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4364.5s)]
*  That was that. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4366.9s)]
*  Suddenly black people are all about Castle Doctor. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4368.179999999999s)]
*  Now he's on my property. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4369.86s)]
*  Now I know. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4371.78s)]
*  And he was running away from her. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4373.0599999999995s)]
*  She was the aggressor. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4374.26s)]
*  But isn't... [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4376.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4377.46s)]
*  But now... [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4377.860000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4378.42s)]
*  Okay, so this is... [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4379.22s)]
*  I'm not mature enough to have this conversation. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4382.1s)]
*  I just want to point that out. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4383.860000000001s)]
*  I think it's better that way. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4384.820000000001s)]
*  I am not mature enough to have this conversation. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4386.18s)]
*  We. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4387.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, none of us are mature enough to have this conversation, but we will have it regardless. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4388.26s)]
*  Now, there was a movie where he was... [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4391.9400000000005s)]
*  I think it just recently came out where he played a bodybuilder. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4394.42s)]
*  I don't know if it was a historical piece, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4398.1s)]
*  but it's a movie about weightlifting, specifically, bodybuilding. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4400.42s)]
*  And he gets absolutely ripped, shredded, jacked for it, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4404.74s)]
*  which I assume he's taking tons of steroids and all these other performance-enhancing drugs. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4408.42s)]
*  You think that's to blame? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4417.06s)]
*  Or... [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4418.74s)]
*  I didn't say that at all. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4419.22s)]
*  I didn't say that at all. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4422.34s)]
*  I didn't say that at all. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4424.66s)]
*  What I'm saying is... [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4425.7s)]
*  Was he taking all those things around the time of his aggressive behavior? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4428.820000000001s)]
*  Is it possible that these steroids could have made him lose control and aggressed? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4433.22s)]
*  It could have made him more aggressive. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4442.1s)]
*  He's pretty big in Creed. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4443.14s)]
*  Maybe he was started there. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4444.02s)]
*  Oh, here's another one. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4445.9400000000005s)]
*  It is Hollywood's fault. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4446.9800000000005s)]
*  It's Hollywood's fault. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4448.26s)]
*  I wasn't. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4449.06s)]
*  You know what? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4449.38s)]
*  I think I got the PR move for him. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4450.02s)]
*  Sometimes a man is struggling with his sexuality. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4452.820000000001s)]
*  He doesn't know how to handle the fact that he might be a different sexuality. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4457.38s)]
*  He takes it out on women in a way that's not fair. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4462.58s)]
*  Because I can't help but notice his pictures with Michael B. Jordan. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4464.74s)]
*  No aggression. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4468.42s)]
*  No aggression whatsoever. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4469.78s)]
*  Did you not hear when he came at us? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4470.98s)]
*  No. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4473.78s)]
*  Oh, this is just perfectly timed. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4474.5s)]
*  Look this up if you can, Joey. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4476.66s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he just came out and said that he was molested as a child. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4479.54s)]
*  Look that up. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4486.5s)]
*  You hold on to that one. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4487.46s)]
*  I miss the old days when it was just like, you hungry? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4488.26s)]
*  Have a Snickers. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4491.22s)]
*  When you were angry or hangry, just eat some. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4493.06s)]
*  Just blame it on how hungry. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4495.860000000001s)]
*  Does he say that he was? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4497.38s)]
*  Yes, blame it on how hungry. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4498.26s)]
*  The old days actually used to work. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4500.66s)]
*  Say what? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4502.42s)]
*  Sexual abuse at age nine. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4502.9800000000005s)]
*  So yeah, so he came out saying he was sexually abused. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4504.5s)]
*  I can't help but- [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4506.9800000000005s)]
*  Man or woman, that counts. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4507.62s)]
*  Both. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4509.54s)]

*  What's that? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4562.919999999999s)]
*  He got accused of abusing a kid, and he was like, oh, I'm just gay. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4563.799999999999s)]
*  No, the kid was- [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4567.799999999999s)]
*  He really is gay. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4568.44s)]
*  The kid was- [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4569.5599999999995s)]
*  But Kevin, listen, the kid was 17 and also gay. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4570.44s)]
*  So that doesn't count. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4577.0s)]
*  That's crazier than what I say, because he's like, that's not a joke. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4578.2s)]
*  I don't think- [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4585.0s)]

*  We're not mature enough to have this conversation, but gay on gay [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4593.0s)]
*  is the exact same thing as male 17-year-old and 30-year-old teacher, female. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4596.6s)]
*  As long as they're both gay. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4603.8s)]
*  If it's a straight dude that's being taken advantage of by a gay guy, that's fucked up. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4604.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4899.160000000001s)]

*  Yeah, that's not true. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4906.200000000001s)]
*  He was molested. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4906.68s)]
*  Canceled. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4909.240000000001s)]
*  No, that's not how that works. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4910.12s)]
*  That's what the Marvel movies try to do, right? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4911.320000000001s)]
*  Remember when Magneto was a bad guy, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4913.88s)]
*  and then we had to feel bad that he was in the Holocaust or whatever? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4915.64s)]
*  Remember, like, everybody, they just used the Holocaust to humanize Magneto. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4919.4800000000005s)]
*  Nobody asked about Magneto, right? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4926.6s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4929.320000000001s)]
*  Of course, the Jewish character in Marvel can control the coins. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4936.280000000001s)]
*  Like, I guess I could believe they shoehorned that story into it. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4940.68s)]
*  Like, none of us needed to know about his backstory and feel bad for him. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4944.360000000001s)]
*  He's trying to kill all the human beings in the world, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4947.56s)]
*  and we're supposed to be like, oh, but he was in the Holocaust. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4950.04s)]
*  It was, oh, we can't do that. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4953.08s)]
*  Why did we let that happen? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4956.280000000001s)]
*  That made him a better villain. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4958.84s)]
*  I agree. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4960.68s)]
*  We should use that. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4961.4800000000005s)]
*  Of course, he was the villain. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4965.72s)]
*  They made the movie. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4969.72s)]
*  They did invent that. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4973.0s)]
*  The Holocaust? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4974.4400000000005s)]
*  We're not gonna do it. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4979.08s)]
*  Go off the rails, dude. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4979.88s)]
*  We're not gonna do it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4981.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4982.52s)]
*  You guys need to calm, simmer down. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4983.16s)]
*  Yeah, we need to simmer down. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4984.76s)]
*  Oh, can we talk about some sports? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4987.400000000001s)]
*  Let's do it, man. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4988.68s)]
*  Buddy, did you see the George the Messiah, Brian Scalabrini drama, this whole thing? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4989.88s)]
*  I'm conflicted on this. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4994.92s)]
*  Okay, so I'll just walk you to anybody who doesn't know. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4996.2s)]
*  George the Messiah is a New York streetball legend. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=4998.84s)]
*  He plays at a court on West 4th Street and 6th Ave called The Cage. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5001.4800000000005s)]
*  Typical, everything you think a New York baller is, like the old man at the gym, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5007.0s)]
*  he's that to a million. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5011.08s)]
*  Talks cash shit, fouls you like crazy. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5013.08s)]
*  If you try to call a foul, he calls you soft. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5015.4800000000005s)]
*  He won't, he's not standing for it and he'll beat you. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5017.8s)]
*  He's got like this, this like nice, like a hook shot floater that goes in [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5020.360000000001s)]
*  and there's all kinds of videos of him beating people one-on-one. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5024.4400000000005s)]
*  Then they ask him in an interview, you think you could take an NBA Hooper? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5027.48s)]
*  He said, yeah, bring him to West 4th University. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5029.799999999999s)]
*  It's different over here. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5032.28s)]
*  He goes, I think I could beat Brian Scalabrini. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5033.48s)]
*  And they're like, that guy's 6'9". [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5036.04s)]
*  He's like, no. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5037.32s)]
*  White Mamba, the white Mamba. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5037.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the white Mamba, I could beat him. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5039.16s)]
*  And then Scalabrini's like, you know what? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5040.599999999999s)]
*  Sounds good, I'll be in New York this Saturday. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5043.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5045.16s)]
*  So they have a game, everybody's hype and Brian Scalabrini, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5045.879999999999s)]
*  it's just one of the more satisfying videos to watch, to be honest with you, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5050.44s)]
*  because we've all played that old guy at the rec. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5053.4s)]
*  Just fouls you and talks shit and is annoying. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5055.32s)]
*  And Brian Scalabrini just bullies this guy. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5057.4s)]
*  Why are you conflicted? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5059.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, he just bullies him. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5061.08s)]
*  So I'm conflicted because obviously I want to side with the New York City [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5062.28s)]
*  streetball legend and shit talker. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5065.96s)]
*  But there's also a part of me that just loves the fact that [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5068.04s)]
*  Scalabrini shows up anytime someone calls him out. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5071.4s)]
*  He's like Beetlejuice. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5075.16s)]
*  He has the greatest quote. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5076.2s)]
*  He says, I'm closer to LeBron James than you are to me. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5077.48s)]
*  And it's just like nobody will believe him, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5080.76s)]
*  but he keeps on busting people's ass every single time. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5083.0s)]
*  There was a story in Boston where they were shitting on him. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5085.4s)]
*  He's the lowest ranked player on NBA 2K or whatever. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5087.24s)]
*  He called like a radio station. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5089.64s)]
*  He's like, yo, anybody who thinks they can beat me that's not in the league, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5090.84s)]
*  come to this rec center in Boston. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5093.8s)]
*  And then he beats the shit out of all of them. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5095.32s)]
*  Every single one. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5096.52s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5097.16s)]
*  He just don't like that energy. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5097.64s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5098.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5099.56s)]
*  No, so I fuck with him for that. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5099.88s)]
*  And there is a moment here where George has fouled the shit out of him. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5101.8s)]
*  And he does some, you know, old school move. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5106.36s)]
*  Like he's got him in a post and he makes a move and he kind of [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5109.4s)]
*  tucks his elbow up and under and hits George in the chin with the elbow to create some space. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5113.08s)]
*  But he didn't back away from it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5119.8s)]
*  He was just like, listen, you wanted to, you want to play around with fire. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5121.56s)]
*  You're going to get burnt. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5125.72s)]
*  And he started talking crazy shit. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5126.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5128.76s)]
*  George didn't really know what to do. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5129.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5130.52s)]
*  So at one point he says he gets on the mic from the guy who's commentating. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5130.76s)]
*  He's like, yo, he was following me the whole time. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5134.2s)]
*  So I started falling back and then one guy goes, you're following him worse though. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5136.12s)]
*  And Brian just goes, I'll get off his nuts. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5139.08s)]
*  So you gotta realize like Scalabrini, it's not like he was raised in Nova Scotia. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5143.16s)]
*  He's been hooping with the baddest motherfuckers on the planet his whole life. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5147.0s)]
*  He knows how to talk shit. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5150.52s)]
*  He's also a big dude. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5151.8s)]
*  He's skilled as fuck. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5153.4800000000005s)]
*  He could shoot his whole thing in the league was just hitting open threes. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5154.6s)]
*  So he can still stroke it. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5157.4s)]
*  Oh, he says something at one point. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5161.24s)]
*  One guy goes, hey, yo, he don't even clock it. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5162.52s)]
*  He doesn't even care. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5164.36s)]
*  He says something like, yo, you go hard, you go hard or something. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5165.56s)]
*  The guy goes, hey, yo. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5168.12s)]
*  That's the white mama bro. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5170.12s)]
*  But it's the most New York shit ever. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5170.52s)]
*  But I think he blanks him. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5171.96s)]
*  I think he's 11-0. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5173.4800000000005s)]
*  He beats his ass. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5174.36s)]
*  I mean, he just bullies this kid, dominates. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5176.44s)]
*  I think Joey pulled up some of the highlights. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5178.36s)]
*  And then he takes off the hoodie at some point. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5180.52s)]
*  Straight at him. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5183.0s)]
*  Love that. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5184.68s)]
*  Yeah, he getting fouled. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5186.04s)]
*  Scalabrini's 46. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5189.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5191.32s)]
*  Yo, we like to believe like the last person on the bench, the NBA, isn't a super alpha. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5192.84s)]
*  You have to be so alpha to even get into the league. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5198.2s)]
*  He was the best guy at his high school. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5201.0s)]
*  The best guy his entire life. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5202.52s)]
*  Best guy at his college. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5204.52s)]
*  And then made the league. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5205.88s)]
*  He wasn't bad with the spurs. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5207.16s)]
*  He did his job. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5208.6s)]
*  Like if you get him open, he'll hit the three. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5209.8s)]
*  And that's not that easy to do. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5212.04s)]
*  There's some high pressure moments with the championship team. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5213.88s)]
*  They got to get a ring. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5215.8s)]
*  So like he hit big shots. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5217.0s)]
*  When you're at home and you're looking at that is like, oh, I can do that. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5218.68s)]
*  I can just stand at the corner and wait for the ball. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5221.32s)]
*  He pulls the fuck up. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5223.48s)]
*  And Scalabrini kind of leaned into it in a way. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5224.68s)]
*  Just by being fun. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5226.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5228.28s)]
*  He would do silly antics. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5229.08s)]
*  He called himself the white mamba. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5230.44s)]
*  So I think he kind of likes in a way that people underestimate him. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5231.639999999999s)]
*  People call him the white mamba, I think. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5234.5199999999995s)]
*  But he didn't mind it. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5235.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5237.0s)]
*  He wasn't like, but you can't. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5237.32s)]
*  I love it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5239.0s)]
*  But shout out George, man. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5239.48s)]
*  I always see George over by West Forth. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5240.679999999999s)]
*  Shout out fucking George. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5243.48s)]
*  I've never seen him. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5244.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5245.16s)]
*  Did you bet on the George Messiah? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5245.48s)]
*  What do we got for March Madness? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5249.4s)]
*  You guys care at all? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5250.919999999999s)]
*  You should care. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5251.879999999999s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5252.5199999999995s)]
*  St. John's. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5253.08s)]
*  I know St. John's won the Big East. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5253.5599999999995s)]
*  To me, all that proves is that if you get the big coach, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5255.719999999999s)]
*  you get the big money and then you can get the good players. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5259.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5263.8s)]
*  Who's the coach? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5267.639999999999s)]
*  To me, all that proves is everything everybody's been saying for the last 30 years. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5268.28s)]
*  What do you mean for 30 years? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5272.5199999999995s)]
*  Everybody knows this. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5273.88s)]
*  You get the best coach in college basketball, you have a chance. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5274.599999999999s)]
*  Why do you have a chance? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5277.639999999999s)]
*  Coach Kate built up Duke from nothing. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5278.599999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like a stellar program before he got there. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5280.5199999999995s)]
*  Did you listen to what I said? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5284.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5285.5599999999995s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5286.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5286.679999999999s)]
*  You get the best coach. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5287.0s)]
*  You get the most money. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5287.96s)]
*  You get the best players. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5288.84s)]
*  But why do you think you get the best players? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5289.72s)]
*  Because you have the best coach. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5291.56s)]
*  No, because you pay the players. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5292.92s)]
*  Because the money goes in when you get the coach. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5294.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5296.84s)]
*  But coach Kate wasn't paying the players. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5297.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5300.52s)]
*  The example. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5300.76s)]
*  Do you remember the example you just used? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5301.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5303.88s)]
*  When you make an argument, do you think? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5304.12s)]
*  What happens in your head when you say no? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5306.4400000000005s)]
*  John Calipari. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5309.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5311.08s)]
*  Good job. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5311.8s)]
*  You're making my point. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5313.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5314.76s)]
*  So you agree? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5315.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5316.04s)]
*  Okay, good. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5316.360000000001s)]
*  That's what I was saying. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5317.400000000001s)]
*  No, you didn't say it at all. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5318.28s)]
*  You said the exact opposite thing. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5319.719999999999s)]
*  No, but this is not new information. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5321.32s)]
*  With supreme confidence. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5321.96s)]
*  This is not new information. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5322.92s)]
*  You are George the Messiah. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5323.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5324.92s)]
*  This is not new information. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5325.88s)]
*  He's Calipari. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5327.16s)]
*  And I'm Scalabri right now. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5327.96s)]
*  This is not new information. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5329.16s)]
*  Hop off his nuts. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5330.5199999999995s)]
*  Just hop off his nuts, Arcon. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5332.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5333.719999999999s)]
*  Who's St. John's coach? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5334.04s)]
*  It's not Pacino, but it is. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5336.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5337.96s)]
*  It's Patino, right? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5339.96s)]
*  It's Patino. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5340.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5341.48s)]
*  So Rick Patino, who's like a legendary college coach. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5342.12s)]
*  I think he even tried to coach in the league once. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5345.719999999999s)]
*  Celtics. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5348.2s)]
*  Celtics, not good. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5348.68s)]
*  It wasn't good, but he's killed it with college. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5349.56s)]
*  And so he's there. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5351.64s)]
*  But in my whole life, I was like, oh, I guess these guys... [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5353.16s)]
*  And I don't want to take anything away from Coach K, but my whole life growing up, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5355.16s)]
*  I was like, oh, I guess these guys just have this intangible skill. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5357.72s)]
*  They understand two, three defense better than these other guys. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5360.12s)]
*  And I said, no, it's like Rick's got the connection. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5362.6s)]
*  I don't want to show him, but he's probably got the connection to Nike. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5364.92s)]
*  And all the players want a connection to Nike. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5367.08s)]
*  So the guys that are getting scooped up early when they're in fucking middle school, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5369.08s)]
*  Nike's put them in the pocket. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5372.44s)]
*  You can't pay them. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5374.12s)]
*  Now you can pay them in the aisle. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5374.76s)]
*  But before, their team is being sponsored. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5375.8s)]
*  You have connection to these people and then you funnel them into this league [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5378.04s)]
*  and they all go into this team. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5380.360000000001s)]
*  And they're also going at that time like, well, man, if I'm on this coach's team, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5381.88s)]
*  I'll probably get more air time and that's going to give me a better chance [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5386.84s)]
*  of getting into the league, et cetera. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5389.8s)]
*  So within two years, they win the Big East. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5391.24s)]
*  And St. John's hadn't won a fucking game in the tournament since we were in high school. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5393.400000000001s)]
*  I feel like who would play for St. John's when we were in high school? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5397.4800000000005s)]
*  Artest didn't play at St. John's, did he? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5400.84s)]
*  Carmella. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5402.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5403.08s)]
*  Syracuse. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5404.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm bugging. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5404.84s)]
*  I think Artest did. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5405.64s)]
*  Was it Artest? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5406.6s)]
*  There was a team back in the day that was like good for a second. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5407.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, no, Barkley. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5409.88s)]
*  There was a kid named something Barkley. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5410.52s)]
*  I don't know that kid. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5413.400000000001s)]
*  It was St. Joe's that little run, but St. John's, I remember being like, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5414.76s)]
*  aren't you all supposed to be good? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5417.56s)]
*  So back in the day, yeah, this is Mark Jackson, Chris Mull and Jason Williams, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5418.92s)]
*  the one that killed somebody. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5422.68s)]
*  And then there was a Barkley that played there at one time. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5425.8s)]
*  And then Metta, Santa for Artest, 100%. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5429.4800000000005s)]
*  Anyway, point being is like, yeah, that's and then I was looking at this in terms of a program. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5433.16s)]
*  So if you're a university, you go, okay, how much does Patino want a year? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5438.12s)]
*  He wants five million a year. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5440.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, how much do we make as a university if we make the NCAA tournament? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5441.799999999999s)]
*  We're selling out every single game during the year and then we're getting a tournament. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5448.919999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you get a piece of that tournament budget. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5451.719999999999s)]
*  You go, well, fuck it, I'd rather pay the coach than pay these players. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5453.639999999999s)]
*  You make final four? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5457.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5458.36s)]
*  Out of here. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5458.919999999999s)]
*  Crazy money. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5459.639999999999s)]
*  And this is within two seasons, right? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5460.2s)]
*  I think Patino took over two years ago. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5462.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5464.5199999999995s)]
*  About something like that. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5465.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know, like it's a pretty fast turnaround. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5467.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm looking like every small university, I'm looking, I'm going, hey, where's the biggest donor? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5469.5599999999995s)]
*  And going, how do we get Calipari? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5474.44s)]
*  How do we get what NBA coach is about to just get fired because they're not good enough? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5477.16s)]
*  Bring his ass in here. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5482.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's make it happen. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5483.5599999999995s)]
*  How much do you even need the coach? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5484.679999999999s)]
*  Like could Elon just be the coach of a college basketball team [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5485.88s)]
*  and get the money figured out and then just get the best player? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5488.44s)]
*  Here's the thing about the coach, and I don't want to see them like I'm shitting on coaches, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5490.76s)]
*  but like, and maybe it's different at the college level, but like the last few coaches. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5493.320000000001s)]
*  Who's about to shit on coaches? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5497.4800000000005s)]
*  The last few coaches that won the NBA championship were all first year coaches. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5498.84s)]
*  Yeah, that guy with Toronto who won last year. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5504.360000000001s)]
*  Maybe they brought something new. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5507.240000000001s)]
*  It was his first year. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5508.68s)]
*  Kerr, I think his first year. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5509.88s)]
*  Kerr won his first year. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5511.240000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, he won in his first year. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5512.84s)]
*  Maybe they brought something new, innovative to the game. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5515.16s)]
*  Like? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5517.64s)]
*  No, just the fact that they were new. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5518.76s)]
*  Like you're saying like, it doesn't take a skill set. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5520.28s)]
*  And I'm saying, no, maybe the fact that they brought a new, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5522.52s)]
*  different way to play is the reason why they won. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5525.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think with Kerr more so, but like the Lakers guy, the first year they win in the COVID. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5527.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like, yeah, LeBron, he's your coach. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5531.8s)]
*  I think that's what happens. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5534.6s)]
*  Like, and maybe in college is a little different, but then you could also argue like [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5535.56s)]
*  the delta between like an average good college player and an NBA level college player is way [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5539.4800000000005s)]
*  bigger than like a really good NBA player and then an average NBA player. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5544.6s)]
*  So like if you have a superstar in college, you're fucking. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5549.64s)]
*  Yeah, Mellon. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5552.200000000001s)]
*  Exactly, Mellon. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5553.4800000000005s)]
*  Like Dominic, Syracuse, it was unstoppable. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5554.360000000001s)]
*  The guy's like fucking 6'9", he could dribble, he could pull up from three. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5557.96s)]
*  It's like he's playing with high school kids. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5562.120000000001s)]
*  Anyway, so what do we think for this year? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5563.88s)]
*  Who do we think takes it? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5566.360000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't even know. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5567.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know anything about college basketball, but I'm going to ride to St. John's. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5568.120000000001s)]
*  That'd be such a fun. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5570.92s)]
*  The city would be great because we pretend like we support St. John's when they're good. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5572.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the whole city gets involved, you see the St. John's jerseys pop out, right? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5577.0s)]
*  We don't even know what borough that shit is in. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5580.2s)]
*  You need that energy back. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5581.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'll take the other New York team. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5582.84s)]
*  I'll take the Liberty. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5584.36s)]
*  Respect. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5586.92s)]
*  All right, so you got Liberty, you got St. John's, you said? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5587.4s)]
*  I'll pull up to Florida, dude, come on. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5589.64s)]
*  They're ranked number one, apparently, which I didn't even know that. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5591.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5593.72s)]
*  Yeah, UF. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5594.12s)]
*  UF's good. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5594.76s)]
*  Or I'm going for Drake. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5595.88s)]
*  You got to support Drake. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5597.48s)]
*  Drake is my guy. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5599.48s)]
*  Drake can do no wrong. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5601.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5602.12s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5603.32s)]
*  I think I'm going... [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5603.72s)]
*  I can't go Duke. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5606.44s)]
*  Don't go Duke. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5607.4s)]
*  I'll go Duke for you so you can go St. John's. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5608.28s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5610.599999999999s)]
*  All right, I'll go St. John's, you go Duke. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5611.64s)]
*  I mean, is Cooper injured? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5613.8s)]
*  If he's injured, I think it changes. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5615.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he hurt his ankle. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5616.36s)]
*  I think it's uncertain if he's going to be... [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5617.32s)]
*  But if they can make it through the first weekend, he might be okay. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5619.4s)]
*  Now, here's the question. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5621.64s)]
*  How often do you play in the tournament? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5622.68s)]
*  Two games each weekend, I think. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5625.24s)]
*  Oh, so it's... [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5627.16s)]
*  Two rounds. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5627.48s)]
*  So like the whatever, the first round and then the second round. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5628.28s)]
*  Then Sweet 16 is a week later. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5631.8s)]
*  Elite 8 is Monday. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5633.24s)]
*  Then a full week, then it's Final Four. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5634.76s)]
*  So in the beginning, you're playing more often, though? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5637.16s)]
*  No, it's just two games each weekend. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5639.0s)]
*  Two rounds each weekend. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5640.2s)]
*  How many times does one team play a week? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5641.72s)]
*  Twice, if they keep winning. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5644.68s)]
*  That's a lot if you're coming off injury. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5646.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think he has to sit out the first weekend. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5648.92s)]
*  I think if they can make it through... [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5651.24s)]
*  Because if they're a one seed, they're playing the lowest seed in the first round. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5652.92s)]
*  You should be able to win without Cooper's leg. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5655.8s)]
*  Second round, hopefully. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5657.72s)]
*  And if you can get through that, then you might be OK for the Sweet 16. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5659.32s)]
*  And that's where it's like, we need you. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5663.48s)]
*  It's crazy how unpredictable this shit is. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5664.84s)]
*  With the NBA, we know who's going to win at the beginning of the season, most likely. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5666.5199999999995s)]
*  Unless there's a big injury or something like that. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5669.88s)]
*  This tournament shit, it's like... [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5672.5199999999995s)]
*  No lead is safe in college because they're not as good. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5674.04s)]
*  They can't close it out. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5676.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's 16 point lead in college doesn't mean anything. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5677.48s)]
*  I mean, I guess it doesn't as much now in the pros because there's so many threes. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5680.44s)]
*  But no lead is safe, ever. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5683.0s)]
*  Yeah, so sick. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5685.16s)]
*  You almost know a comeback is happening. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5685.88s)]
*  I wonder if that's part of it. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5687.32s)]
*  In the pros, they weren't shooting as many threes. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5690.28s)]
*  There weren't as many players that could hit pro threes. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5693.08s)]
*  So the leads were a little bit safer. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5696.2s)]
*  Whereas the college threes always been super close. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5698.84s)]
*  So the guys who can't really shoot at NBA range could shoot pretty efficiently in college. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5701.08s)]
*  And they could evaporate a lead pretty quickly. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5708.44s)]
*  So I wonder if, obviously, part of it is the skill set. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5711.08s)]
*  There's singular and unbelievable talent. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5714.92s)]
*  But there's just more guys who can hit a college three. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5717.56s)]
*  So you could evaporate that lead. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5719.96s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5721.64s)]
*  I always attribute it to a college kid not being as able to withstand the momentum shift. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5722.4400000000005s)]
*  So they're emotionally caught up in the game. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5727.400000000001s)]
*  They're not as used to it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5729.4800000000005s)]
*  Also, you got to see every one of them fans. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5731.0s)]
*  When you're at home, they're in your physics class. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5734.6s)]
*  If you miss that free throw, you got to look at that guy [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5737.56s)]
*  and you got to explain to you how gravity works. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5739.88s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5743.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5744.76s)]
*  Well, let's see what happened. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5745.0s)]
*  Listen, if you're betting, you know you're doing a mistake. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5745.72s)]
*  OK, Stake is the leader in global betting in US social casinos, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5747.72s)]
*  been on top sports and political events, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5750.360000000001s)]
*  and used the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5752.040000000001s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5754.360000000001s)]
*  Amos, you met an OnlyFans girl? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5755.96s)]
*  What, a male OnlyFans guy? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5757.400000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5758.84s)]
*  I saw an OnlyFans girl on Instagram, on my Instagram, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5759.4800000000005s)]
*  and I brought up to Mark that I think this is in, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5763.080000000001s)]
*  this is crazy. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5767.0s)]
*  I actually didn't want to say the allegation I have. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5767.72s)]
*  Just pull her up. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5769.56s)]
*  Yeah, just pull her up. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5770.6s)]
*  Where are we going with this? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5772.4400000000005s)]
*  This is an interesting, an interesting woman that's positive. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5773.24s)]
*  Stop talking about me on the pod. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5776.44s)]
*  It's never been good. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5778.44s)]
*  OK, now it's good. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5779.5599999999995s)]
*  It's never been good. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5780.5199999999995s)]
*  Now it's good. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5782.12s)]
*  Now this is positive. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5782.84s)]
*  There has yet to be a positive story. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5783.96s)]
*  OK, pretty girl. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5786.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, she a little reary. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5789.0s)]
*  Oh, I know this one. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5791.08s)]
*  Is this the one? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5792.28s)]
*  No, that's the other one. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5792.84s)]
*  That other one got a dumper on it. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5794.2s)]
*  So there is a girl, I don't know if she's on OnlyFans, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5796.5199999999995s)]
*  but she's definitely all over my TikTok and Instagram [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5798.76s)]
*  and everything. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5801.48s)]
*  She plays starch. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5802.12s)]
*  Pause. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5803.24s)]
*  That is the girl. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5803.64s)]
*  No, the other one got a bigger dumper. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5804.68s)]
*  No. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5806.12s)]
*  OK, well, I think what we're all talking about is, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5806.84s)]
*  there is a girl who is putting on a Down syndrome filter. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5810.84s)]
*  That's her. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5816.12s)]
*  I think this is the girl that's using a filter [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5816.84s)]
*  because she's like, she's sort of too up front about it. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5818.92s)]
*  I think one of the captions that caught me off guard was like, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5822.599999999999s)]
*  I'm downs and also down or something crazy. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5825.32s)]
*  I saw that one. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5829.4s)]
*  And then I went on the Instagram channel. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5830.04s)]
*  For research purposes. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5831.48s)]
*  Now, this is a tricky one because they are above age [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5833.48s)]
*  physically, but mentally. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5838.5199999999995s)]
*  They stop maturing probably around, I don't know, 12, 13 [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5841.719999999999s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5844.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5845.08s)]
*  So despite that. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5845.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5847.48s)]
*  So what is the rule with that? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5848.2s)]
*  I think it's intellectual maturity. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5852.36s)]
*  Yeah, you got to go, no. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5854.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you can have sex with a Down syndrome person. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5855.799999999999s)]
*  No sex. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5859.4s)]
*  But you can admire them. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5860.44s)]
*  No, wait a minute. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5864.28s)]
*  The body's still of age. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5864.919999999999s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5865.879999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5866.2s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5866.679999999999s)]
*  He's onto something. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5867.48s)]
*  Admiring them would not involve any intellectual manipulation at all. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5869.0s)]
*  And their body is of age. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5873.48s)]
*  And there's no intellectual connection between you two. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5874.919999999999s)]
*  You're not exploring her thoughts. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5876.839999999999s)]
*  You're not talking to her. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5877.879999999999s)]
*  You can never listen to them when they speak. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5878.759999999999s)]
*  You're talking about women in general? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5880.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5882.2s)]
*  So this is really interesting. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5884.44s)]
*  It is not wrong if they had one before. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5885.799999999999s)]
*  And we know it's not wrong because Victoria's Secret, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5888.2s)]
*  I think, had one of them at the show. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5890.12s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5891.88s)]
*  And they have a Down syndrome model. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5892.2s)]
*  Modeling. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5893.8s)]
*  So clearly it's OK that we observe them and admire them. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5894.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5897.5599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5898.12s)]
*  No. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5899.0s)]
*  Good. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5899.4s)]
*  I'm safe. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5899.5599999999995s)]
*  You're safe. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5900.2s)]
*  You're safe. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5901.5599999999995s)]
*  Now having sex with them, you would be having sex with a 12-year-old trapped in a 24-year-old [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5902.36s)]
*  fucking supermodel's body. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5908.36s)]
*  Yeah, which is gross. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5909.72s)]
*  Which is wrong. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5911.0s)]
*  So it would be like the same for her. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5911.96s)]
*  With me? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5913.4s)]
*  You would have to argue that you had the maturity of a 12-year-old in court. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5916.28s)]
*  Yeah, fall in the pot. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5920.12s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5921.0s)]
*  I have tennis balls on my fingernails. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5921.88s)]
*  Hey, look at my fingernails. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5924.76s)]
*  I have tennis balls all over my fingernails. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5925.96s)]
*  Like, da-da-da. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5927.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5928.04s)]
*  It's pretty retarded. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5928.68s)]
*  He already said this. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5930.44s)]
*  Now, I think she's faking. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5933.16s)]
*  Yeah, that brings up a whole other ethical ripple. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5935.24s)]
*  Well, the Victoria's Secret model is not faking. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5937.4800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5940.04s)]
*  But this girl that you are bringing up, it appears is pretending to have Down syndrome. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5940.68s)]
*  So... [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5946.44s)]
*  There's multiple of these bitches. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5947.08s)]
*  Yeah, that we would look at them on the internet, which is working. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5948.44s)]
*  According to the algorithm. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5952.04s)]
*  I think she's using AI face swap or something. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5954.759999999999s)]
*  That's devious, dude. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5958.12s)]
*  That's devil's work. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5959.08s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5959.639999999999s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5960.36s)]
*  That's her angle. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5962.2s)]
*  Who developed the AI face swap to make you look down? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5963.719999999999s)]
*  Like, is she also coding? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5967.719999999999s)]
*  No, I'm sure it's an app. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5969.88s)]
*  I'm sure it's just an app. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5971.0s)]
*  So you think there's an app out there? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5971.799999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5973.5599999999995s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5974.36s)]
*  I'm going to find out. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5975.24s)]
*  Oh, see, look. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5978.5199999999995s)]
*  There's another one. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5979.48s)]
*  Look at him acting like he just found out. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=5981.88s)]

*  But just watch. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6181.88s)]
*  And this has been viral because White Lotus [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6182.92s)]
*  has been kind of building with this weird subplot. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6185.240000000001s)]
*  We can just press play whenever you want. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6187.8s)]

*  Who cares? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6190.120000000001s)]
*  So this is one brother and another brother. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6190.92s)]
*  Hey, smooch on the lips. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6193.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's initially. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6195.160000000001s)]
*  And then the second one is similar to what [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6196.84s)]
*  has happened on the flagrant set, I believe, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6198.4400000000005s)]
*  between Miles and David. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6200.68s)]
*  He likes that. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6201.88s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6209.240000000001s)]
*  God shows this episode right after we find out [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6209.72s)]
*  about Miles and David. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6212.52s)]
*  And you're still trying to wrap your mind around [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6214.68s)]
*  the characters because you are not caught up on the show. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6216.360000000001s)]

*  at his butt or whatever. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6223.240000000001s)]
*  He made out with him a third time. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6223.96s)]
*  Horr. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6225.08s)]
*  That kid is David. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6225.96s)]
*  Miles is the one that's a little disturbed by it. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6228.2s)]
*  But. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6230.360000000001s)]
*  But he's still OK. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6230.68s)]
*  He didn't move away. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6233.88s)]
*  Do we know? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6236.52s)]
*  I haven't gotten to this episode yet. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6237.4800000000005s)]
*  But do we know if they're like actually brothers or? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6238.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6243.0s)]
*  They're blood brothers. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6243.4800000000005s)]
*  Seemingly blood brothers. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6244.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6245.56s)]
*  They're trying to hook up with these girls. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6245.88s)]
*  The girls start kissing. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6247.32s)]
*  And I think they kiss. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6248.76s)]
*  Each of them kisses the younger guy. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6250.2s)]
*  And then they're like, now you need to kiss if we don't just. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6251.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like classic party thing. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6253.96s)]
*  He's like, you guys should kiss. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6254.84s)]
*  Classic party. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6255.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6257.16s)]
*  It's like classic party situations. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6258.04s)]
*  Right, Miles? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6262.36s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6264.68s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6265.8s)]
*  You guys keep on testing. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6267.08s)]
*  Whenever we accuse him of, he is. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6269.24s)]
*  I just want to let you know. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6271.24s)]
*  And he's going to incriminate himself. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6272.6s)]
*  We don't need to say a single thing. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6273.96s)]
*  Every time he opens his mouth organically and authentically, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6275.96s)]
*  he will prove he is racist. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6279.8s)]
*  And now, hey. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6281.16s)]
*  You guys stood up for that. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6281.8s)]
*  Just keep podcasting. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6283.24s)]
*  I'm not here. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6284.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not here. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6284.84s)]
*  That's what David's dick looks like. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6285.4800000000005s)]
*  OK. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6292.68s)]
*  I thought they were building up that the younger brother was going to hook up with [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6295.0s)]
*  the sister. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6298.679999999999s)]
*  He seems like he's into whatever. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6299.24s)]
*  The little brother's a creep. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6301.4s)]
*  He's kind of innocent, but also demented. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6302.599999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6305.88s)]
*  So now everybody's back in on the show. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6306.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6308.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6309.24s)]
*  Just so first of all, I just want to say something, which I admire a TV show. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6309.5599999999995s)]
*  This is their third season, right? [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6314.92s)]
*  So you could grab your balls and go on the third season. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6316.599999999999s)]
*  By that, I mean, you could take as long as you want to build up the storylines. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6320.04s)]
*  And then when you finally execute, huge cannonball splash. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6324.04s)]
*  The first few episodes came out and people were writing this shit off. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6327.96s)]
*  They're like, oh, they lost it. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6330.84s)]
*  The first two seasons were good. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6332.12s)]
*  I still feel that way. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6333.24s)]
*  Even after this episode. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6335.16s)]
*  I still. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6336.12s)]
*  This episode was weird as fuck. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6336.28s)]
*  It was my least favorite. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6337.799999999999s)]
*  I didn't feel that way. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6338.759999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6339.96s)]
*  Let me just get out what people were saying. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6340.44s)]
*  And I spoke to one of the producers of the show and he was like, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6342.04s)]
*  yeah, it's annoying that there's a lot of criticism about it. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6344.36s)]
*  But we're building up towards this thing. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6346.759999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I think that takes courage. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6348.599999999999s)]
*  Now with today's the internet culture, you just want to give everybody something in [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6351.16s)]
*  the first three seconds so they don't scroll away. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6354.84s)]
*  So I think it's brave to actually slow play something and then deliver big five episodes [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6356.92s)]
*  in or six episodes. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6363.72s)]
*  And the reality is with the what's it called? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6365.0s)]
*  The binge culture. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6367.88s)]
*  People can just if they turned it off after two episodes and they find out something crazy [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6369.8s)]
*  happened on six one weekend, they'll just plow through the rest. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6373.24s)]
*  So you can really let these characters marinate. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6376.28s)]
*  Can we give a show time? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6378.92s)]
*  They had two great seasons. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6381.32s)]
*  They deliver every time. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6382.4400000000005s)]
*  The show opens with a murder, a mass shooting at a resort. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6383.4s)]
*  And everyone on episode two is like, this sucks. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6386.6s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6389.160000000001s)]
*  We're going somewhere. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6390.120000000001s)]
*  Now, I wouldn't recommend doing this. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6391.240000000001s)]
*  Season one, I wouldn't recommend doing it. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6393.400000000001s)]
*  Fair. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6395.0s)]
*  Season two, that's ballsy. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6395.400000000001s)]
*  But season three, you've earned it. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6397.56s)]
*  You put out two great pieces of content and you should know as the consumer, yo, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6398.76s)]
*  all these characters are a little fucked up. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6402.92s)]
*  You might not know why yet, but pay attention to lock in. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6404.52s)]
*  And I think they do a really good job on this show specifically of like creating mystery. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6407.72s)]
*  You don't know why each person is doing whatever they're doing, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6411.88s)]
*  but you are curious to see where this is going. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6414.76s)]
*  And so as much as people bitch or complain on TikTok, you're going to keep fucking watching. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6417.320000000001s)]
*  And then when they come through with a hammer, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6421.16s)]
*  hopefully that's happening in these next few episodes. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6423.320000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen, but it seems like the reaction to it was this. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6425.320000000001s)]
*  And then also there's a monologue. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6427.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it goes crazy. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6429.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, Sam Rockwell. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6431.08s)]
*  Sam Rockwell. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6432.2s)]
*  And I love the fact that they didn't even mention he's in the show. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6433.0s)]
*  Usually you have an actor of that size on a show like this. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6435.8s)]
*  There's not a lot of big actors in the show. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6438.360000000001s)]
*  Like you can't like who's who's a big actor in the show outside of the dude [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6440.12s)]
*  that played Slytherin. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6444.44s)]
*  I mean, dude, the K-pop girl. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6446.919999999999s)]
*  I thought all of them were. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6448.599999999999s)]
*  She's not a big actress. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6449.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but she's just dumb famous. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6450.839999999999s)]
*  She's super famous and she's so beautiful. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6452.759999999999s)]
*  Walton Goggins is pretty big, right? [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6454.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's like, I think he's pretty big. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6455.799999999999s)]
*  He's not huge. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6460.679999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6463.0s)]
*  Like Walton Goggins, I think has just recently with the success of Fallout, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6463.48s)]
*  maybe become this like beloved character or character actor. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6467.879999999999s)]
*  But like there's not like huge superstars in the show. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6472.68s)]
*  Like the fat white bitch from the previous seasons. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6475.400000000001s)]
*  Like she was like a pretty famous person and she got famous from being on the show. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6477.8s)]
*  And I miss her. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6481.88s)]
*  Coolish. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6483.0s)]
*  She made the fuck up. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6483.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Jennifer Coolish. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6483.96s)]
*  Sorry that I. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6484.76s)]
*  Anyway, my point is, is like when you have an actor of Sam Rockwell's name, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6485.56s)]
*  his size on a show where there's not a lot of huge marquee actors, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6490.52s)]
*  usually you would put it in the promo. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6494.280000000001s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, by the way, this guy's coming. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6495.72s)]
*  So you guys should watch the fact that they don't even mention it. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6497.8s)]
*  He's not even the credits or anything like that. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6500.280000000001s)]
*  I think that's that shows balls. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6502.36s)]
*  It shows confidence. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6503.8s)]
*  The monologue is insane. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6504.599999999999s)]
*  Do you watch it? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6505.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6506.04s)]
*  I'm not up to this episode yet. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6507.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6508.2s)]
*  Mindfuck. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6508.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6509.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6509.639999999999s)]
*  Why is it so good? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=6509.88s)]

*  The first season I'm watching and then the end you're like well that sucked. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7192.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7196.2s)]
*  Nobody's happy this is all miserable and then the second season I was a little more prepared [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7196.68s)]
*  but got even darker and this season I'm like whatever you're throwing at me it's going to be [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7199.96s)]
*  fine. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7203.24s)]
*  Now I will say this this does not make me want to go to Thailand at all. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7203.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7209.0s)]

*  It was awesome. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7214.44s)]
*  Yeah the one in Hawaii I imagine. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7215.0s)]
*  Maui. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7217.24s)]
*  Maui. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7217.48s)]
*  I don't need to go to Thailand at all. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7218.5199999999995s)]
*  No but you're not like a meditative kumbaya motherfucker so that. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7219.96s)]
*  But is that the is that the only reason. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7223.719999999999s)]
*  But there is a white lotus effect with like these places people start going to it afterward. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7224.92s)]
*  Like the hotels are so beautiful you're like I just need to experience that. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7228.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7231.8s)]
*  I think the fact that they have to give up their phone you're like. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7233.08s)]
*  Now just like the natural beauty of it when they're on the boat. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7238.76s)]
*  I think it looks beautiful. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7241.5599999999995s)]
*  Really. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7242.599999999999s)]
*  I don't like jungles bro. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7243.88s)]
*  I'm a beach guy over a jungle guy. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7245.0s)]
*  I'm off the jungle. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7247.4s)]
*  There's a lot of bugs out there. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7248.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't like the forest I don't like the jungle. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7249.639999999999s)]
*  I'm off of that. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7252.599999999999s)]
*  It bummed me out that it felt like Bangkok was quite close to this place. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7253.5599999999995s)]
*  In the show correct like it seemed like he got there pretty quick. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7257.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7260.44s)]
*  Jamil stayed at this resort and I asked him I was like oh they're pretty close to each other. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7260.84s)]
*  Like they'd be so amazing to be able to do both. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7264.6s)]
*  And he was like no they're flights away from each other. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7266.68s)]
*  It's like oh that bums me out because I would like to go to that resort. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7268.4400000000005s)]
*  Like how long is a flight like 30 minutes or is it five hours. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7270.84s)]
*  Like an hour or two. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7273.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7274.76s)]
*  That's not a problem. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7275.0s)]
*  But I thought it was like you could go there for like a little faster. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7275.96s)]
*  You have to fly to Bangkok anyway I'm sure. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7278.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7280.6s)]
*  I thought they were close. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7281.4800000000005s)]
*  I thought this was shot in like multiple different resorts and they make it look like. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7282.360000000001s)]
*  No it's always shot at the four seasons I think. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7286.12s)]
*  Oh really it's just one. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7287.8s)]
*  All three seasons are shot at the four seasons. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7289.24s)]
*  So fourth season Sicily when we went was completely sold out because of the show. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7291.719999999999s)]
*  I just don't know if we'll have that same impact in Thailand. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7296.92s)]
*  Yeah I don't think it will. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7300.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7301.32s)]
*  That jungle shit is overrated. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7301.8s)]
*  I think the three grunts. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7303.0s)]
*  I mean Thailand's a developing country. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7303.639999999999s)]
*  I went there I went to Phuket but it was like oh this feels like India. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7305.16s)]
*  Three people on a scooter and like the roads look kind of like dirt roads. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7309.24s)]
*  It's a snake show I don't need to see snakes. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7312.92s)]
*  No I'll go to a snake show. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7315.32s)]

*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7335.48s)]
*  The K-pop band. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7336.12s)]
*  She's still doing it. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7337.0s)]

*  You know that show Emily in Paris. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7343.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7345.48s)]
*  So years ago I think like a few seasons ago there was a storyline in the Emily in Paris [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7346.28s)]
*  show where the heir to the LVMH throne they don't call it LVMH in the show but that's [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7351.4s)]
*  what they're alluding to is dating this like Asian K-pop star. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7357.16s)]
*  That girl in real life is dating the heir to the LVMH. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7364.2s)]
*  And that happened years after like I don't even think they could have been privy to it. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7368.2s)]
*  We're talking about. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7372.44s)]

*  Kind of weird. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7376.28s)]
*  Or were they dating on the low for years and then. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7377.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah they might have had a scoop or something. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7381.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7382.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7383.72s)]

*  like traditional beauty where like angles and the face and all this other stuff is not her [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7389.8s)]
*  at all like when you describe her her face is like soft. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7394.12s)]
*  She's very symmetrical. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7398.5199999999995s)]
*  Symmetrical of course of course but like the other girl the model girl on the show [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7399.96s)]
*  who's obviously stunning the girl from Quebec or whatever like that. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7404.28s)]

*  The only reason that girl moved to Austin in the show is because of Joe Rogan. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7519.88s)]
*  Yeah probably. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7524.4400000000005s)]
*  I've never heard the word Austin even brought up on TV, film, news before Joe moved there. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7525.08s)]

*  The LA girl that moves to Austin and adopts the local culture. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7547.96s)]
*  And Mike White is so good at picking up on like subtle nuance that he's like oh this is [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7550.6s)]
*  the perfect thread. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7554.44s)]

*  And she's like how are we really going to talk about politics. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7560.76s)]
*  But also it taps into that like coastal elitism too like how could you be around them. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7564.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7570.68s)]
*  It's just so classic like liberal woman liberal rich rich woman from the coast. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7571.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7578.200000000001s)]

*  All right what else we got guys. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7594.76s)]
*  This UMG Drake thing. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7596.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7598.4400000000005s)]
*  Why what's like what what's going on here. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7599.320000000001s)]
*  I feel UMG listened to what everybody was saying online and just put it in legal terms. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7602.04s)]
*  They really just called out Drake for all the hypocrisy and just so the history of it we all [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7609.96s)]
*  know Drake assume UMG they came back and they're like hey you're just salty that you lost this [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7617.4800000000005s)]
*  rap battle and we and oh actually Drake is saying that they're putting him his safety. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7624.52s)]
*  But they basically said like you lost the battle you always pretend to be unbothered. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7630.6s)]
*  This clearly bothers you a lot. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7634.200000000001s)]
*  It was a battle you provoked. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7636.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7637.72s)]
*  Also you accused him if you're worried about defamation of character before he said anything [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7638.200000000001s)]
*  about you with kids not only did you talk about him being a child or abusing his girl you also [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7642.76s)]
*  invited him to talk about this in the tailor-made freestyle when he's like talk about it with [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7649.56s)]
*  underage girls that's a gift from Joe Budden or whatever. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7654.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7657.080000000001s)]
*  That's you talking saying hey why don't you talk about this. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7657.56s)]
*  So you're inviting him to talk about it he talks about it and now he's putting your safety in danger. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7661.320000000001s)]
*  Has Drake ever spoken about his justification for this lawsuit. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7665.8s)]
*  No. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7669.56s)]
*  Like nobody's asked him about it. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7670.200000000001s)]
*  I mean I'm sure people have asked him he's not. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7672.04s)]
*  Drake is a guy that has platforms that if he wants to use he can. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7674.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah he's not talking about it publicly at all. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7677.080000000001s)]
*  And it's funny that he's doing the thing that they accuse him of doing the rapper who acts [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7680.200000000001s)]
*  unbothered but then behind the scenes you're doing this shit. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7684.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7688.360000000001s)]
*  And it's very petty. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7688.76s)]
*  They're quoting his lines and shit like that like it's really funny the way they came back. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7690.76s)]
*  So if he drops this I mean it's just is it a massive L do we just move on does anybody care. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7695.96s)]
*  They can never make me hate Drake. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7702.120000000001s)]
*  Isn't that crazy. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7703.88s)]
*  They're trying to make me hate Drake bro it's never gonna work. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7704.360000000001s)]
*  They said he signed a public petition that criticized prosecutors using lyrics against artists. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7706.44s)]
*  So like you signed a petition saying you shouldn't be able to use an artist's [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7711.4s)]
*  lyrics against them they're just lyrics and now you're suing us for this. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7714.44s)]
*  I mean yeah again it's. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7719.16s)]
*  Well I think that the lawsuit says that they were specifically inflating and promoting the song. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7720.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7730.44s)]
*  Which had the inflammatory lyrics but I don't think the lawsuit is about the inflammatory lyrics I [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7731.08s)]
*  think it's about the inflation of the song. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7735.16s)]
*  Yeah I think he's saying the lyrics specifically is what is putting his health or his safety. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7737.08s)]
*  Yeah right. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7741.5599999999995s)]
*  He's not saying UMG promoting the stream you are promoting a song which will bring violence [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7743.16s)]
*  toward me look at the lyrics of the song calls me a child molester. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7747.32s)]
*  Right but again just so we understand what we're saying here he's not saying you put out a song [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7749.96s)]
*  that has these lyrics it's you are inflating it. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7756.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7759.5599999999995s)]
*  Over normal amounts. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7760.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7761.5599999999995s)]
*  So I think it's about the inflation not the lyrics. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7762.04s)]
*  But the inflation the manufacturing of that inflation could add harm so if you up it 20% [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7765.08s)]
*  now you've increased 20% of the harm so I'm suing you for that 20% not what the lyrics are there. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7772.92s)]
*  And I think this is why. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7777.64s)]
*  But do you understand. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7778.52s)]
*  Yeah yeah and I think this is why United has to find a different way I'm sorry UMG [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7779.08s)]
*  has to find a different way to go at him because I think the only thing they could say is we do [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7782.6s)]
*  this for every artist we've done this for you and they can't say that because then that blows up [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7787.08s)]
*  their business. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7790.92s)]
*  Blows up the business model. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7791.16s)]
*  So they have to find hey just dismiss this case with prejudice. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7792.12s)]
*  So that's a good point. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7795.4s)]
*  Yes so kind of Drake is Drake's calling out the business in a way where the business [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7798.04s)]
*  has to acknowledge that they do do this. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7804.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7806.44s)]
*  And now he was the beneficiary. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7807.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7809.08s)]
*  But I guess he's also saying if all things are fair I'll still beat all these motherfuckers. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7809.4s)]
*  I think that was his goal his goal is just to blow this whole shit up like let's take the curtain [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7815.64s)]
*  down and let's just because if the curtain's down he's still going to beat them. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7820.6s)]
*  Maybe they all get 30 percent less but he still beats them. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7825.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7828.76s)]
*  But there are other people that might be the beneficiaries of that inflation more than him. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7829.320000000001s)]
*  In other words like again we're talking about some brilliant idiots but like there are a lot [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7836.280000000001s)]
*  of people that can get like a number one album for a week or a number one song for a week [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7842.52s)]
*  and then the next week the streams die. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7847.88s)]
*  I think was Russ saying that on the pod? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7850.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah I think he was. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7854.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7855.08s)]
*  He's like so basically you can buy a number one and then the next week nobody really knows about it. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7855.48s)]
*  Yeah but you want number one that's all that matters. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7859.32s)]
*  100 percent. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7862.12s)]
*  And you go on number one might make people listen to it. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7862.68s)]
*  Well this song's number one let's listen to it. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7864.68s)]
*  But and then exactly so you can manufacture it and then that manufactured number one [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7866.44s)]
*  can potentially turn into a legit number one or it cannot. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7871.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7875.24s)]
*  And yeah but maybe he's like I'd rather be on a level playing field with everybody [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7876.28s)]
*  because I'm still going to fuck these people up. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7880.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7881.8s)]
*  So he's just showing everyone's cards pulling the curtain down from everything [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7882.76s)]
*  and just be like yo this is how the business works. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7885.639999999999s)]
*  But the business might be more helpful to these other artists than Drake. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7887.24s)]
*  For sure. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7891.08s)]
*  So he's like all right let's tear this whole shit down I'm going to be the one that wins in the end. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7891.4s)]
*  I'm assuming that's the case if he's willing to go at the label. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7894.92s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7898.04s)]
*  So they haven't dropped the lawsuit this is just UMG continuing to try to protect themselves. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7899.24s)]
*  Yeah because they can't be honest. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7904.2s)]
*  They can't be honest and say this helps everybody that we've covered including you. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7905.8s)]
*  We should make Drake look a little bad but it also like this is our business model so we have to [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7909.96s)]
*  protect that. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7913.88s)]
*  Yeah but they're basically admitting that they can inflate a song and make it bigger than it [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7914.92s)]
*  actually is. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7918.92s)]
*  So now whoa if he wins this some people go yeah but it worked for you too he goes yeah okay it [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7919.639999999999s)]
*  worked for me but they admitted they made it bigger than it was supposed to be and my songs [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7924.679999999999s)]
*  that I released weren't made bigger than they were supposed to be because I didn't release [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7930.04s)]
*  them through UMG or whatever the fuck it is. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7933.72s)]
*  So then this could work out for Drake still. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7936.12s)]
*  I don't know because I think. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7940.12s)]
*  Legally. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7941.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7942.12s)]
*  Legally I don't think the public opinion is going to really care. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7942.68s)]
*  If UMG has to come out and say yeah we inflated it by 50% I think that now the song is an absolute [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7945.72s)]
*  bang. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7950.6s)]
*  That's a huge hit. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7950.84s)]
*  100% but if you're a Drake fan you go oh shit the only reason it was like that is because they [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7952.04s)]
*  inflated by 50%. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7956.4400000000005s)]
*  Drake fans. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7957.240000000001s)]
*  Drake fans. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7957.96s)]
*  I already believe that. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7958.84s)]
*  Drake fans have not been talked out of anything. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7959.72s)]
*  What's this billboard thing about billboard is changing the way that they [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7963.88s)]
*  count sales have you guys seen this? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7971.240000000001s)]
*  Academics posted something I forget what it was I could try to find it. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7973.4800000000005s)]
*  What now they're like including streams in a different way? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7976.92s)]
*  Yeah or they're counting them in a different way and if they've showed that you are using bots [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7979.16s)]
*  then they will suspend your account for 12 months or whatever the fuck it is. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7985.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7988.6s)]
*  But it's billboards acknowledgement that bots are being used. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7989.16s)]
*  You don't put out a precautionary measure. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7993.5599999999995s)]
*  Digital albums sold via an artist label or other official website must now be redeemed [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7995.16s)]
*  in order to be chart eligible in addition verification using hcapscha is now required [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=7999.48s)]
*  to prevent bots. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8004.76s)]
*  So hcapscha is that thing where you have to type in the code to prove you're a real person. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8007.48s)]
*  So how do you do that for every single stream every time I play a song I got to do an hcapscha? [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8012.76s)]
*  Yeah minimum prices of albums increasing at all retailers 799 for CD 799 for cassette 15 for vinyl. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8016.92s)]
*  Is it for like buying albums? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8024.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah and I think they said if you drop it on like another site like outside of the streamers or [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8026.28s)]
*  something like that you know how kind of dropping his music and stuff like that on his own website. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8031.4s)]
*  So those could be more easily manipulated. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8034.92s)]
*  Any d2c store with three submissions of illegitimate data within a 12 month period [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8036.839999999999s)]
*  may receive a minimum 90 day reporting system. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8041.24s)]
*  Direct to consumer is that when you're selling a merch with your album like is that the bundle? [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8043.48s)]
*  That or if you're selling it on your own site. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8049.879999999999s)]
*  Oh that's interesting. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8052.2s)]
*  Wow so they're basically acknowledging that their formula or algorithm has been manipulated. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8053.719999999999s)]
*  And whoa which everyone kind of knew but it was never really confirmed by any of the big [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8062.12s)]
*  like leaderboards. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8068.44s)]
*  Yeah I mean people said this a lot about I mean not to not to shout out Travis obviously he's a [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8069.48s)]
*  megastar but they're like if you're selling a bundle with the album it's going to make the [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8074.679999999999s)]
*  sales look this big when in reality there are people that are buying merch or they're buying [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8079.799999999999s)]
*  these other little artifacts that have to do with the album which I don't think should reflect poorly [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8084.04s)]
*  on Travis because it just means his fans really want to consume his stuff but those same people [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8088.5199999999995s)]
*  that are consuming on Spotify might also buy the album over here just to get access so now you have [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8094.679999999999s)]
*  the same person that's buying twice you don't get a real idea of like how many people are consuming [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8099.24s)]
*  the music. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8106.12s)]
*  That's where I don't think this is going to be a win for Drake because exactly what you said about [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8107.0s)]
*  Travis I don't think that should affect the way we look at Travis I don't think it will affect [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8110.599999999999s)]
*  the way we look at the artist it's what you always say it's how do we feel I think we generally feel [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8114.44s)]
*  not like us was an absolute fucking smash and hard part six was just like a big L and that's just what [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8119.16s)]
*  it is okay numbers can be numbers I agree with you but I do think that like I'll bring this back [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8126.36s)]
*  into the the special that we just put out so we were in we're like top two for the first week and [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8132.92s)]
*  then we've been in top 10 for the second week now Netflix telling me every all these people telling [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8141.5599999999995s)]
*  me the agents telling me that like usually specials don't stay in the top 10 for that long they don't [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8147.88s)]
*  even stay for the week let alone be in there for a second week it's like very rare so to me what I [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8153.64s)]
*  see that as like okay we could do great promotion with this sick video with Matt Damon shout out that [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8158.84s)]
*  we could get the first day tons of people to watch and usually there's just this fall off [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8163.160000000001s)]
*  to have a second week it means people are telling other people to watch it that's the only way it [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8167.64s)]
*  can go people obviously I'm doing promo I'm doing these press these interviews are coming out more [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8173.64s)]
*  people are hearing it absolutely but at the end of the day it's like are people enjoying it and [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8177.72s)]
*  are other people consuming it right so I think there is something to like that longevity with [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8182.2s)]
*  the consumption and I do compare that to what Russ was saying about music where it's like day one [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8187.72s)]
*  big hit and then next week not a single straight for very few that was a podcast someone will launch [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8193.24s)]
*  a new podcast he goes number one for a couple days then it drops off and then it's not it's like they [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8197.64s)]
*  go okay I got the number one podcast Rogan and then Rogan will come back up a week later when it's so [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8201.56s)]
*  it's not actually that so I think this is billboard trying to adjust for like to have a more accurate [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8205.64s)]
*  understanding of how many people are really consuming because really intelligent record [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8212.279999999999s)]
*  companies and artists have found a way to kind of like trick it to make it look like this big [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8217.0s)]
*  success yeah whatever reality's not Travis is going to be a huge success no matter what we've [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8221.64s)]
*  seen him perform in fucking Rome for like all of Italy it looked like it's not going to be Travis [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8225.88s)]
*  but there might be another artist like uh I don't know what's her like Megan Thee Stallion or something [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8229.88s)]
*  pop for like a day and then nobody listens to the album after that and then you go wait are people [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8236.359999999999s)]
*  listening like what what exactly is happening here I think it is on billboard to tell us if people are [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8240.599999999999s)]
*  listening or not also someone that's a huge megastar still would benefit from this because [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8245.4s)]
*  they're going against other megastars yeah I mean so like someone like Travis or Meg or some other [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8248.599999999999s)]
*  type of massive celebrity is going against Taylor or going to some other type of ultimate megastar [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8253.16s)]
*  that they need to you know they would benefit from like a little sweetener absolutely it's also [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8257.72s)]
*  reigning in from what I've read what artists can do so like they can't they can't release more than [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8262.84s)]
*  four different types of the album deluxe version regular album blank even like they're potentially [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8267.64s)]
*  before releasing 10 different albums different songs because your super fans are going to buy [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8273.16s)]
*  10 different times yeah yeah and you can only change the cover like a few times like it's sort [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8276.599999999999s)]
*  of consolidating what artists are able to do it allows a artist that's not as famous or not as [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8281.56s)]
*  successful to have a fighting chance and right now they don't like if you're a super big if [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8287.0s)]
*  Taylor's dropping the same day as like indie rock artists yeah indie rock artists have no fucking [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8291.88s)]
*  chance because even if people don't like Taylor's album her label can just buy the fucking streams [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8296.2s)]
*  and guarantee you're the number one so it to me it's cooler they're like an indie rock artist [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8301.4s)]
*  with an amazing album that people are like really fucking with has a chance to knock out one of these [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8306.52s)]
*  big time acts like that's fire yeah but is it doing anything to the streamers where it's like [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8311.8s)]
*  they can buy the bots on spotify or apple or any of those places like is it preventing that in any [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8319.4s)]
*  way i don't know i don't know enough to tell you i i assume but maybe not maybe it's just on these [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8324.439999999999s)]
*  like what third party sites or whatever yeah because that would be worse for the indies [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8329.32s)]
*  then they'd be completely screwed it is it is peculiar that they would do it i don't know if [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8335.0s)]
*  billboard is owned by these big streamers but it's in the best interest of the record labels who [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8338.68s)]
*  own a piece of the streamers to control that market as much as they possibly can they want to be able [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8345.08s)]
*  to turn it up on their artists and they want to be able to kind of ignore the ones that they're [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8351.64s)]
*  not signed to or they don't have signed to them so it does seem like it's kind of democratizing [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8355.24s)]
*  the way that we review how much music has been consumed which is not in the best interests of [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8361.16s)]
*  umg and if umg and these other big streamers own big companies own parts of spotify that's not in [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8366.68s)]
*  their best interest either like you want to create the illusion if you need to hopefully you don't [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8374.36s)]
*  have to but you want to if you need to yeah because they've got so much money invested in them can't [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8379.720000000001s)]
*  they just ask spotify be like yo are 50 of the streams coming from india you know i mean like [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8383.960000000001s)]
*  couldn't they just look at the back end be like yeah you're getting all your streams from india [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8388.04s)]
*  it's probably bots yeah like couldn't spotify just cut that shit i think spotify came out not [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8390.76s)]
*  too long ago spotify's getting paid by the sorry to interrupt but like spotify's getting paid per [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8394.84s)]
*  stream so if the record label wants to spend money streaming them spotify's getting paid they're not [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8398.52s)]
*  going to be like please don't give us your money they're in the business of people streaming the [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8403.48s)]
*  music so whether it's a bot or not they're getting their three cents or you know fraction of a penny [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8408.36s)]
*  or whatever it is per stream so why would they say no to it as long as they're getting paid every [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8413.56s)]
*  single time but are they getting the same money if it's just a bot they have to be like how does it [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8417.8s)]
*  work like subscription ads stuff like that no i think every time a song gets played they have to [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8423.0s)]
*  pay a certain amount of money to spotify or no they have to they have to spotify has to pay a [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8428.76s)]
*  certain amount of money to the record label that's what i thought yeah that spotify's hosting is [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8434.12s)]
*  they're licensing it from the label so they have to probably shift so it's no my mind spotify would [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8441.08s)]
*  be like yeah we're not getting any money from these subscriptions from some random house and [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8445.0s)]
*  so they should if anything it's costing them more for to have bots so they should want to get [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8449.08s)]
*  rid of bots i think they are cracking down on bots like i i'm pretty sure i saw this a couple months [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8453.0s)]
*  ago where spotify is like oh if like 80 percent of your streams are coming in bots we're going to [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8457.0s)]
*  start penalizing you like they they know what's going on and they're like now they're trying to [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8461.72s)]
*  cap it we'll still let you do it but just not so aggressively as you've been doing it could you [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8466.6s)]
*  look that up joey to see because every single one of those bots doesn't have a spotify account that [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8471.96s)]
*  they're spending money monthly on right a lot of them are probably listening on like the free [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8475.72s)]
*  version where you got to have ads and if if the advertisers find out that a large percentage of [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8479.72s)]
*  the people consuming music on spotify aren't even real they'll reduce their what is it per click [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8486.359999999999s)]
*  yeah spend well i think indians are real people but it does like it's just some shrewlaken dude [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8494.199999999999s)]
*  like listening to like music all day listen to ads and shit well is it even him or does he have like [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8499.56s)]
*  a farm where it's a thousand phones and they all like you've seen those the farms right so just [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8503.56s)]
*  phones all across the whole wall so if you're spending for a million streams or you're spending [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8508.039999999999s)]
*  for a million people to watch your advertisement on spotify and then you find out 250,000 of those [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8513.08s)]
*  people are just one guy in sri lanka with a lot of phones or a handful of these people you're like [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8517.64s)]
*  all right well i'm only going to spend 750,000 because 250 isn't now 25 percent of your revenue [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8522.039999999999s)]
*  out the door you got to clean that bot shit up yeah whoa yeah dude so this might work out [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8527.24s)]
*  maybe it doesn't change the way that we see drake it doesn't change what happened in the beef but [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8534.68s)]
*  maybe it does transform the music industry a little bit and if drake does a halftime show at the [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8538.039999999999s)]
*  at the world cup oh man come on dude see you later out of here he's back drake is back half the [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8542.52s)]

*  i don't think they ever will and if it does come out i think it's gonna be a political weapon [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8613.24s)]
*  against the people they want dog shit there's gonna be just as dumb they're gonna be like iran killed [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8616.36s)]
*  jfk we gotta go get oil yeah man probably they're smart man they're the best at politics [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8620.04s)]
*  make a claim that they're not gonna do half ass it and say and they could be like look see we did [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8627.08s)]
*  it yeah but the public really didn't get them yeah but i voted for the guy who said he was [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8632.84s)]
*  gonna release that and he released it yeah i think a lot of files are burned and shit like i think [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8636.68s)]
*  you learned from build the wall that was too much that was like that's like i have to build the thing [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8641.48s)]
*  yeah but this i could be like i'm gonna release the files yeah i released them they're not [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8646.199999999999s)]
*  yeah they were there you can't read them but they're out there yeah like the i've seen one [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8650.439999999999s)]
*  the the thing that i think sauger even said it like they they redacted stuff that were already [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8654.359999999999s)]
*  was already out yeah so there was more shit covered yes so it's like i don't know i don't think i don't [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8658.359999999999s)]
*  think we're gonna know anything they don't want us to know here how kind of like skeptical or like [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8662.6s)]
*  kind of down on this this first part of trump's term that sauger was interesting he was you [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8667.4s)]
*  remember he was just like i don't like what's happening i don't like the power elon has i don't [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8672.279999999999s)]
*  think this bodes well for trump and his legacy like it was interesting to hear that from a staunch [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8676.359999999999s)]
*  conservative they're like i'm not very happy with this administration right now is that what you got [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8680.44s)]
*  from the combo that's what i got from the convo i should have been listening i didn't get that [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8684.84s)]
*  was criticizing elon he was criticizing you all didn't hear that yeah he was criticizing elon not [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8690.84s)]
*  too much yeah but he was just like the first hundred days defines a presidency right now it's [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8694.84s)]
*  getting dominated by this this is the story and that is incredibly important for trump's legacy [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8698.28s)]
*  and if he keeps letting elon dominate the headlines instead of the other things he's doing that's not [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8703.24s)]
*  going to be good like i'm not very bullish on how this is going to be viewed and i think he wasn't [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8707.48s)]
*  bullish on a lot of the dode stuff in general but like it was interesting to hear that from a guy [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8711.32s)]
*  who i figured would would love what was happening yeah the sense i got was just like hesitant and [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8715.4s)]
*  like he sees that it's a risky play that could pan out but he does see the risk that's involved [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8719.880000000001s)]
*  in the strategy yeah well i thought it was even more like not that into it than what you're saying [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8724.6s)]
*  now to be fair i think that we were kind of like forcing him to give a steel man and i think that's [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8728.92s)]
*  maybe what you're responding to maybe you see all the test is exploding yeah i'll send it selling [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8733.880000000001s)]
*  his tesla i'm not gonna sell it yet because the resale value is tanking right now but uh [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8740.92s)]
*  just rebrand have you seen how people rebrand the tesla but this is terrorism [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8746.92s)]
*  this is domestic terrorism tell him tell him not for real like you should lock these motherfuckers [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8751.08s)]
*  up this is you can't do this bro freedom what's interesting vandalism and terrorism if you do it [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8755.480000000001s)]
*  against the guy like that's i don't know vandalism might be too mild of a word but terrorism i assume [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8760.52s)]
*  people got to be in danger yeah i feel no people are in danger it's somewhere in the [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8768.44s)]
*  tantalism oh wow i looked at terrorism as like uh violence with a political agenda [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8771.720000000001s)]
*  i think that's the definition of terrorism but then is property violence like if no one dies [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8777.96s)]
*  yeah does it need to like this is property damage marks mark's right yeah i guess the [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8782.68s)]
*  property damage can't count as terrorism because in spain there was a group that would uh blow up [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8788.76s)]
*  cars and they would make sure that nobody was there but they would just blow up the cars or [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8794.76s)]
*  like there was a bomb in a building but they would make sure nobody was there but the idea was to [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8799.24s)]
*  like stoke this fear and they had a political agenda so i don't know if anybody needs to get [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8802.44s)]
*  hurt for it to be defined as terrorism i just think we should look that up so i think but i [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8805.8s)]
*  think it wasn't that when they were trying to fight uber no no this is this is way back when [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8809.8s)]
*  they were fighting over yeah this is this is like there was a separatist group i think in like the [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8814.599999999999s)]
*  bask country or something like that yeah and um i i wonder even if like the car bombs and [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8818.759999999998s)]
*  shit like that in ireland were like people in the cars i think they were targeting people if i'm [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8824.92s)]
*  not mistaken yeah and at some point that person will likely be in the car at a car dealership [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8829.64s)]
*  you know these cars are empty sure sure sure but that has nothing to do with the political agenda [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8834.68s)]
*  part of it oh no no there's a political agenda i just don't know if you would call this violence [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8840.04s)]
*  or like even a building where you know people are going to go into or whatever i just feel like a [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8843.24s)]
*  car that's unsold that doesn't belong to anyone except tesla right that's on a parking lot it just [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8847.08s)]
*  seems different yeah it seems like this is this is trying legal i think we're like splitting hairs [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8852.04s)]
*  yeah on a word but i think the point that i'm trying to make here is that like this is an [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8856.2s)]
*  aggressive act of whatever you want to call is this violence what is this terrorism probably [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8862.2s)]
*  find is a calculated use of violence or the threat of violence to instill fear and achieve [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8867.08s)]
*  political or ideological goals often targeting civilians or non-combatants right it's definitely [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8871.0s)]
*  instilling fear it's absolutely instilling fear right and for a political agenda like they don't [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=8875.720000000001s)]

*  argument i can find online i've been using chaff gpt and try to find one is that they're saying it [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9209.88s)]
*  could be framed as the is the boston tea party vandalism or was it terrorism or was it revolution [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9215.08s)]
*  oh and i was like oh i like this this is good let's let's talk it out oh that's kind of nice [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9222.76s)]
*  well t was oh yeah i guess it was hurting the government specifically not i guess yeah i guess [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9228.28s)]
*  it's hurting elon's pockets and he's in the government well the t was there were private um [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9234.52s)]

*  a publicly traded company uh they're attacking well just like tesla's so they're attacking that [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9247.4s)]
*  and then the idea was is the east india trading company would uh hope that england would protect [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9252.6s)]
*  their business interests in america because england was the beneficiary with that tax revenue [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9259.64s)]
*  so yeah this is exactly what they're doing so they better hope they're right [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9264.44s)]
*  what does that say like the difference between like terrorism and revolutionary is the uh the victor [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9268.119999999999s)]
*  yeah or terrorist and freedom fighter yeah yeah yeah so yeah we'll see what happens with this is [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9272.6s)]
*  burning a car could affect a lot of people you could catch a large fire there's like throwing tea [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9277.4s)]
*  overboard doesn't affect people possibly also they're not just doing it to tesla dealerships [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9282.12s)]
*  they're doing it to owners of teslas as well yeah that's like someone's tea out there yeah taking [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9287.32s)]
*  someone's tea from their house and then setting but there were people working on that ship that [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9291.32s)]
*  had to move the tea and that was their job and then if the east india trading company stops or [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9294.84s)]
*  dutchie's india trading company stops doing it they're out of a job those people suffer [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4All-nt4Yzg&t=9299.08s)]
