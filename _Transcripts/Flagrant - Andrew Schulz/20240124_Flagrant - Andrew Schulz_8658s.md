# Vivek Ramaswamy on Becoming Trump's VP & Who REALLY Controls America
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg)
*  What's up everybody and welcome to Flickr and today we are joined by Trump's new running mate, man [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=0.0s)]
*  You're here to tell us you're running with Trump VP. What do you think? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8.64s)]
*  Uh, you know, we're we're thinking things through man. You know, we uh, wait a minute. I was being sarcastic. That looks like confirmation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  We're uh, yeah, i'm going i'm going to see him tonight. Really just at a rally to support him [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=19.04s)]
*  Okay, and you know, just tell you the truth. We're thinking things through like this is a mutual decision [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=23.84s)]
*  I really like that. I mean my view is whatever role somebody takes on so i've run companies and one of the things i've learned [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=27.68s)]
*  Is when you hire people you got to make sure that everybody is swimming in the same direction [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=32.96s)]
*  It's not one person's fault or another person's fault [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=37.52s)]
*  Yeah, but if you have you know, if you got daylight between you even a company or an enterprise or whatever you're building [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  You don't want to figure that out [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=45.52s)]
*  Years in gosh good. It's good to figure that out. So you guys have synergy because he did synergy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=47.28s)]
*  I think we we definitely we're definitely in for the same mission of saving the country [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=51.92s)]
*  Overall mission and the role that each of us plays or i'm gonna hit the role [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  He's gonna play as the next president and the role i'm gonna play whether it's inside government or outside government [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=58.0s)]
*  We're gonna figure it out now. He did [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  deliver [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=65.12s)]
*  A head shot before the primary. I mean we're we're competing man. We're we're but you were loving him [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=66.56s)]
*  I was loving the country and that's what i've been loving the whole time now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=72.4s)]
*  He didn't like some things I said about him. Like what what did you say? Well, I think uh, it was it was the well [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=75.04s)]
*  Show him that size 14 bro. I didn't know that kind of size 14. Yeah [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=79.76s)]
*  That's a well built indian [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  I was approaching I was getting right there at about six feet flat and that was not what a size 14 predicts [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=89.28s)]
*  Okay, but tell us okay. So he he delivers this shot [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=94.64s)]
*  He said that there are some things that you didn't uh that he didn't like. Yeah, I mean it was a primary [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  We're running against each other and so I play to win and so we all play to win [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  But I respect i've said it every step and I meant it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=104.88s)]
*  I respect his legacy and what he did for the country. Okay, he kept us out of war and he grew the economy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=108.0s)]
*  Okay, I think those are two of the most important things a president can do. Yeah [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=113.36s)]
*  He also rolled over the log of the deep state, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=116.8s)]
*  And we saw what crawled out. I need to learn about the deep state. I want to get into all we can get into all of that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=120.48s)]
*  It's part of my notes [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=124.48s)]
*  And so and so I said one of my things is in the campaign is he rolled over that log and we saw what crawled out [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=125.36s)]
*  I'm bringing the pesticide and that was my view is you have to you want to take out the deep state [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=130.96s)]
*  You actually actually want to just spray it down. Give me a name. It's not you're missing the point if you're asking the question [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=135.04s)]
*  It's a system [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=140.8s)]
*  It's a good political machine [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=142.4s)]
*  It's a machine. It's the truth imagine in one of your companies like you asked the people at the company like you own the company [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=144.4s)]
*  You're talking to your ceo and you're like who is the problem sourcing this company and then somebody said back to you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=149.68s)]
*  They're like it's the machine. It's if you're asking a question, you don't even know the answer [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=155.04s)]
*  Like I would listen to it. Nancy Pelosi. I would listen to it. It's it's the it's she's a cog [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  She's a cog. These are all cogs in a give me some cogs. I want to know about the cogs [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=164.48s)]
*  Are you a cog in the machine? I'd like to think not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=168.72s)]
*  But and and i'm not right now, but if you get in there for eight years [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=171.44s)]
*  Maybe you become one and then it's time to get the hell out actually. So that's my view is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=174.8s)]
*  Get in there do your service get out know when to drop the mic and I think it takes fresh blood to do it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=179.52s)]
*  I think you get to be an outsider a solid outsider like a true outsider once [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  And so that was my whole premise in this race is i'm going to take the america first agenda to the next level [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=190.0s)]
*  Reach the next generation while doing it forget the republicans forget the democrats [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=195.12s)]
*  Build a movement that's founded on two basic ideas. Yeah [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=199.68s)]
*  I think these are not particularly partisan ideas. I think they're rather obvious, but apparently they're controversial today [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=203.6s)]
*  The people who we elect to run the government [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=209.36s)]
*  Should be the ones who actually run the government. Yeah, that's number one not unelected bureaucrats [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  So whoever it is agree disagree with me partisan black white doesn't matter the people we like to run the government should run the government [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=216.72s)]
*  And the moral duty that they owe. Yeah is to the citizens of this nation not another one boom [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=222.88s)]
*  There we go. That's it. That's the whole premise [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=228.48s)]
*  And so the fact that that was as controversial as it came out to be in this in this race [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=230.64s)]
*  I think revealed a lot about where we are as a country and gives me a redouble sense of purpose to if it's not going to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=237.76s)]
*  Be as the next president, which is how I hoped to make a positive difference in this country [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=243.12s)]
*  I'm going to find what the next best way is VP. Do you think you're too qualified to be VP? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't know that I mean, I don't see things as like a hierarchy like president number one VP [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=251.6s)]
*  And I don't know that VP imagine it's a caste system like like [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=256.08s)]
*  Speaking speaking to you know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=260.16s)]
*  familiar concepts [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=262.56s)]
*  No, but is it a casting decision there? I might actually call it more of it. Yeah, but uh, okay, that's right [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=265.68s)]
*  That's what I thought you meant. Yeah, I refer to my former acting my former friends career [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=270.56s)]
*  I saw that you took a comedy class 10 shows. Did you have a bit? Uh, they were they were not very good [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=275.44s)]
*  No, but we would love to hear about seven eight years [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  I what's the premise even the premise the thing is the premise was just based on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=282.96s)]
*  Exaggerated versions of my life, right? And so there were [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=289.26s)]
*  It was like I would say I have a good demographic. I have no native [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  I have no native talent for comedy. I would say that but I was amazing. I went to this american comedy institute [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=297.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know this one in uh, it's a mid is there's some people went through there [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=302.96s)]
*  Who were like, you know aspiring comedians or whatever and I just did in the evenings [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=306.88s)]
*  I had my job and I clearly had interests that went beyond my job [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=311.28s)]
*  eventually, it's what led to me starting my company, but [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=315.28s)]
*  Anyway, I went to this class and you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  The guy actually had kind of a formula where without having native god-given gift for comedy to still make it passable [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=319.84s)]
*  Actually, it wasn't it wasn't great [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=326.88s)]
*  But it was not horrendous [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  And the thing he told me was and this actually led me and I owe him gratitude because it's what led me to found [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  My first company. He said [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Take a notebook [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=338.08s)]
*  Wherever like there's an exception that I don't have it with me right now [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  I've kept it a decade later still do it take a notebook everywhere you go [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=341.76s)]
*  Anytime something annoys the hell out of you write it down [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  How many notes are about black people? Okay? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=349.52s)]
*  I self-censor [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=353.76s)]
*  That's right, it was uh the the notebook was black [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=356.88s)]
*  But there were white pages inside [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=361.12s)]
*  Together so the beauty. Yeah, just think of it the beauty of that. Yeah, it's such a beautiful country [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=363.68s)]
*  Right. So if you didn't use a brown pen you would sell out. I'll tell you that's right. That's right. I probably do [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=367.76s)]
*  I don't remember any of the bits. Oh, I not not super well. Yeah, you need some years ago [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=373.04s)]
*  You need all of my medication, dude [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=376.96s)]
*  But I would know how to bring you one of those I would I would be the guy to help you on that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=379.92s)]
*  We're gonna get to your drug dealing days in a while. This guy used to deal drugs legal [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=383.44s)]
*  The legal is more profitable kind of legal talk about legal. It's cooler to be like I deal drugs [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=386.72s)]
*  Yeah, they almost everybody on this, uh, you know, a sofa couch chair situation has dealt drugs [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=391.44s)]
*  Did you know right? Yeah, okay. All right. Well, I mean, I'm not I'm not an exception [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=396.88000000000005s)]
*  Did you sell drugs at all? Uh, no, I bought oregano one time from a drug dealer [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  oregano [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=406.8s)]
*  Did you how did you consume it? I thought it was weird and then it was not [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  He didn't know [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=414.8s)]
*  Okay, okay. Wait, so so you being too competent to be trump's vp. This is what my concern is is that like [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  The last was just sort of because I want to leave people with this advice especially young people for being an aspiring entrepreneur [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=422.0s)]
*  So I took the notebook down anytime something I know is you there's a joke in it [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=428.4s)]
*  But actually it's the best advice that I could give you for starting a business [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=431.68s)]
*  That's what I wanted to land it because that's what led me to start actually your frustration [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=435.68s)]
*  Your frustrations are often rooted in something real in the world that needs to be and then your emotional attitude to that is part [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=440.0s)]
*  Of what gives you the passion to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=445.12s)]
*  For a good comedian apparently tell a joke. It's great in my case. It ended up taking me in a different direction [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=447.2s)]
*  So that was okay seal that off vp. I don't know if it's the right role or not kamala harris genius [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=450.8s)]
*  She can you know, she's in charge of ai policy, man [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=456.88s)]
*  I don't know if she could spell ai, but I think that she's in charge of ai policy [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=460.08s)]
*  There must be something good there [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Get the notebook [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=467.04s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know what's going on there goofball, right genius, right? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=469.76s)]
*  He's an absolute passion a man man full of passion love and a man full of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  Man full of bro, you know [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=479.67999999999995s)]
*  Brilliant videos exuding that every day you try to convince people in iowa that you believe in jesus and the other gods [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=482.32s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=489.11999999999995s)]
*  We believe jesus is a son of god that's what I said [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=492.96s)]
*  God which is different than saying he's the son of god and the guy's talking to a presidential nominee. He goes [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=496.0s)]
*  There's one son of god [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean look, I will respect there there were there were a number of people who I met who struggled [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  One pastor towards the end of the campaign and he wrote an extensive post [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=509.12s)]
*  Which was and he's a influential pastor and he's a he's a good man, but he wrote I didn't admit him at this time [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=513.44s)]
*  part of a demonic cult the way, you know the way he describes hinduism and and he recommends everybody vote against [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=519.84s)]
*  The member of a demonic cult being our u.s president. He wrote that about you. Oh, yeah, it was an extensive post [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=526.48s)]
*  No, but I think those are the words exact words demonic call. What's the justification? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=532.16s)]
*  Why I think so so so I think people were just like stay, you know, stay away from what did you say to him? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=537.3s)]
*  I called him. I called him on the phone and said I would love to sit down with him [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=542.66s)]
*  He came out you gotta show up in the middle of a blizzard in the middle of a blizzard [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=545.86s)]
*  he came out and he listened and we had a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  Deep conversation on the back of my campaign bus afterwards. Yeah [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  and he [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=557.3s)]
*  Brought up. He's a collector of ancient books. He brought he said it was the most valued book and he left it with me [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=558.42s)]
*  I'm still I promised him I would read it and I would it hasn't been that long since the end of the campaign [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  But in his world [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=569.9399999999999s)]
*  It's about it's it's a book about the values that informed american history [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=571.62s)]
*  And it was a signed book by the author and it's not in print anymore. It's an old book and it had real sentimental value to him [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=576.02s)]
*  He then after our talk had an extensive post on you want me to pull it up actually? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=581.14s)]
*  Yeah, sure [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  I could pull it up in the case of vivek if god decides to use him as a president [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=586.42s)]
*  I'll have cause for joy and certainly support him and pray for him as often as I have for any other president [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=590.34s)]
*  But what we are discussing is whether or not we as christians are allowed to reward a candidate with authority and power [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=596.66s)]
*  In a republic and then it goes on to explain why even though he agrees with everything that I say [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=603.62s)]
*  This is ultimately why no christian should be permitted to vote for me in his opinion [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=610.26s)]
*  Do you think if you were white and christian you'd be president right now? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=614.9s)]
*  White and christian would I be president right now? I don't think so [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=618.58s)]
*  I don't think that was the rate limiting issue [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=622.66s)]
*  So I don't I mean just to i'll call it like I did I do think it was an obstacle for me [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=625.3s)]
*  in iowa [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=630.02s)]
*  I think that we [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=631.38s)]
*  opened up conversations about faith at like a level of depth that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=632.98s)]
*  We have not and I think people iowa and myself have not otherwise and would not have otherwise gone into [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=638.26s)]
*  I think many people [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=644.02s)]
*  Elucidated for themselves what the distinction was between pastor and president and how they could [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=646.26s)]
*  With conviction understand that their religion was fundamentally different from mine voting for president [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=652.02s)]
*  And for what it's worth it actually was a forcing function for me to get to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=657.62s)]
*  Like okay, you say you're hindu you say you're christian or whatever you go about your daily business [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=662.5799999999999s)]
*  But this process I think really forced me to deeply understand what the core convictions of my faith actually are [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=667.14s)]
*  And so it was [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=675.06s)]
*  it was very [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=676.5s)]
*  Productive in that sense actually, but I think that there are a small minority. I don't believe in god [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=677.7s)]
*  Yeah, actually [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=683.38s)]
*  Like what even the theology undergirding my faith [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=684.8199999999999s)]
*  I think that that was something that I probably emerged with greater clarity of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=688.18s)]
*  By the end of this campaign rather than the beginning because it's a very frequent topic that comes up [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=692.18s)]
*  It forces you to press yourself to understand. I'm sorry. I would love to hear that and how [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=696.98s)]
*  Yeah, you change your but what does that make it? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=702.8199999999999s)]
*  Rediscover is what I would say. Yeah, how did that make you feel reading that like this is a guy who's vote you want? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=705.4599999999999s)]
*  He's going at you for your faith. And then the end of it is masterful community all positive qualities [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=710.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I still that was actually the beginning of I will never and no one of my faith should ever vote for this man [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  How does that fuck the right answer? How does that make you feel? So that's what i'm interested in [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=721.14s)]
*  So I would tell you what my my first [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=725.3s)]
*  Fleeting reaction is what my total reaction would have been a year ago [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=727.86s)]
*  Which is one of fury rage frustration [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=731.7s)]
*  And like maybe a tinge of sadness [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=735.62s)]
*  and disappointment [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=738.58s)]
*  Does that feel that yeah, okay [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=740.4200000000001s)]
*  That's what I that's that's sort of a microcosm of what my first instinct is and like I said like that's [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=742.4200000000001s)]
*  At the start of this journey what I would have what I would have said [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=748.74s)]
*  right now what I [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=751.7s)]
*  Feel on the other side of that is then some [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=753.22s)]
*  Okay pause [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=756.34s)]
*  I [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=758.6600000000001s)]

*  I [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=5992.34s)]
*  I think all of us have an innate hunger for purpose, right? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=5994.34s)]
*  To feel like what we're doing here in the short time that we're given is meaningful. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6000.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6005.34s)]
*  And I think that each of us also has our own unique God-given gifts. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6006.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6011.34s)]
*  And I think the true source of satisfaction is matching, at least for me, and I don't, my sense is it's probably true for most people, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6012.34s)]
*  is matching what your unique God-given gifts are to your sense of purpose. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6018.34s)]
*  Purpose in the world, yeah. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6024.34s)]
*  And if you can match those two things. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6025.34s)]
*  It's an exciting thing. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6027.34s)]
*  That's much more, that is sort of true self-actualization. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6028.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6034.34s)]
*  That is true liberation more than whether it's a bigger case B or a lower case B. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6035.34s)]
*  And so for me, that match felt like it was in leading this country. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6040.34s)]
*  And weird as it sounded, and most people say it's terrible, I was pretty convinced we were going to succeed at this. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6046.34s)]
*  I mean, I hope. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6051.34s)]
*  Like when we're setting out. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6052.34s)]
*  But even at like 0.0, nobody, I thought we're, it's not like we're going to go and see where this goes. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6053.34s)]
*  I thought that this is going to end with, I think I have the right vision. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6059.34s)]
*  I have deep conviction in it. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6063.34s)]
*  I believe that most people in this country, if they don't see it today, can be made to see that. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6065.34s)]
*  And ended up getting 8% rounded up. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6070.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6073.34s)]
*  And so there was some structural reasons for that this time around. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6074.34s)]
*  But I think that nonetheless, that was what motivated me. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6078.34s)]
*  You're asking a question about the politics or the analysis of it. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6084.34s)]
*  But what compelled me, that's what I felt is the unique. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6086.34s)]
*  Was it exciting? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6090.34s)]
*  Confluence. Yes. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6091.34s)]
*  Did you love every single day? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6092.34s)]
*  I love most days. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6093.34s)]
*  Not every single day. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6095.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6096.34s)]
*  But I love most days. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6097.34s)]
*  More unexpected challenges of the campaign that you didn't see. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6098.34s)]
*  Yeah. What was the shit? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6100.34s)]
*  I mean, I'm going to sound so, it's going to sound so stupid when I say it because it's like, should have been obvious. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6101.34s)]
*  The first time for everything. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6106.34s)]
*  No, it is like, I mean, the influence of mega money on politics. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6107.34s)]
*  Break it down when you first felt it. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6113.34s)]
*  When I understood the dynamic of dealing with mega donors, actually, it's sort of disgusting, actually. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6115.34s)]
*  So I spent 30 million. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6121.34s)]
*  It's a lot of our money. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6122.34s)]
*  You spent 30 million of your dollars. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6123.34s)]
*  Close to 30. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6125.34s)]
*  Yeah, right about 30. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6126.34s)]
*  He can do that. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6127.34s)]
*  I just want to write that down. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6128.34s)]
*  It might have been 29.5 or something, but something like that. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6129.34s)]
*  30 million. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6133.34s)]
*  To lose. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6135.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6136.34s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6137.34s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6138.34s)]
*  You're really twisting the knife here. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6139.34s)]
*  You could have gave me 15, bro. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6140.34s)]
*  What the hell is that? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6141.34s)]
*  You're twisting the knife. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6142.34s)]
*  I'll just joke. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6143.34s)]
*  But take the delta between your net worth and our net worth. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6144.34s)]
*  But it's, I mean, at a certain point, like what's the point? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6147.34s)]
*  Can you write that off? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6153.34s)]
*  There's got to be something. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6154.34s)]
*  No, no write off. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6155.34s)]
*  No write off. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6156.34s)]
*  You spent 30. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6157.34s)]
*  Yeah, just out the door, not coming back. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6158.34s)]
*  And never coming back at all. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6159.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6161.34s)]
*  And your wife, how did you train her to be like this? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6162.34s)]
*  She does not care about, she just does not into, she's not that into stuff, actually. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6165.34s)]
*  She's also a doctor on our list. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6170.34s)]
*  She's not into stuff. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6171.34s)]
*  She's a surgeon. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6172.34s)]
*  I think she's good. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6173.34s)]
*  The thing is, the thing is, she's, I mean, the thing is, actually many of the procedures [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6174.34s)]
*  she does, we have such a broken healthcare system. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6177.74s)]
*  I bought Mark Dinner once, and my wife was like, why? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6179.34s)]
*  30, if I spent 30 million dollars? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6180.34s)]
*  I ordered double though. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6181.34s)]
*  I was smoking. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6182.34s)]
*  God damn. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6183.34s)]
*  You got a Tomahawk steak right there. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6185.34s)]
*  Okay, go. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6188.34s)]
*  So anyway, I think that, yeah, I mean, if we don't, that's our sense of, for me it was [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6189.34s)]
*  a sense of purpose, is what I would say. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6194.34s)]
*  I believe God's given me unique gifts in this category to use them. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6196.34s)]
*  I believe that there's a purpose that needs to be fulfilled, and I'm here to fulfill. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6200.34s)]
*  And that's what gave me my sense of deep satisfaction about this. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6206.34s)]
*  And she was super supportive of it, largely because she's doing the same thing. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6210.34s)]
*  Like, I think, actually, the last time we had a conversation like that was in reverse, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6213.34s)]
*  believe it or not, was when, so our first son, Karthik, was born in, I talked about [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6219.34s)]
*  this in, actually, you might not have gotten to that part yet. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6223.34s)]
*  Did she go back to school after their kid? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6226.34s)]
*  She doesn't go back to school. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6228.34s)]
*  She's in residency, so she's finishing her residency here at Cornell. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6229.34s)]
*  That's in the last chapter, I forgot, in Cornell, Columbia here. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6233.34s)]
*  She's an ear, nose, throat surgeon, but she specializes in throat surgery. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6236.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6241.34s)]
*  She's an airway surgeon. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6242.34s)]
*  And he's born in February of 2020, which is an interesting time to be born in New York City. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6243.34s)]
*  He's born February 23rd, 2020. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6248.34s)]
*  And that was like literally the week after that is when that first wave. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6250.34s)]
*  And people went COVID policy crazy in this country in the next couple of years. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6255.34s)]
*  But that first wave in New York City, I don't know if you guys were here. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6260.34s)]
*  That was not a joke. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6262.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6264.34s)]
*  And the hospitals were super overfilled. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6265.34s)]
*  So she had just had an emergency c-section at Columbia on February 23rd, 2020. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6267.34s)]
*  And yet she's an airway surgeon. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6274.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6276.34s)]
*  And so there's short staff at the hospital. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6277.34s)]
*  They've got patients piling up. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6279.34s)]
*  Every operating room is converted into an ICU. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6281.34s)]
*  And there's literally a lot of older people included, like going to die, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6283.34s)]
*  unless there's people who are able to help them with the skill set she's been given. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6287.34s)]
*  And she's very good at what she does. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6291.34s)]
*  And so in some sense of the union of our God-given skills and our sense of purpose, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6294.34s)]
*  for her, that was March of 2020. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6300.34s)]
*  So a little over three weeks in after emergency c-section, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6302.34s)]
*  she could take six months off if she wants to for maternity leave, or at least six weeks. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6306.34s)]
*  She goes back. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6311.34s)]
*  So she's in the operating room less than four weeks after given emergency c-section. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6313.34s)]
*  And back then nobody knew what this was back then. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6317.34s)]
*  So you told people this? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6323.34s)]
*  Not a lot of people. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6324.34s)]
*  This is good stuff. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6325.34s)]
*  Come on, a lot of people. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6326.34s)]
*  We're too late in to hear this. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6327.34s)]
*  This is good stuff. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6329.34s)]
*  Move over, Michelle Obama. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6330.34s)]
*  This is... [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6332.34s)]
*  So I'm a biotech CEO. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6334.34s)]
*  I'm CEO of Roevent here. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6335.34s)]
*  We don't care. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6336.34s)]
*  We're the doctor. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6337.34s)]
*  I know. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6338.34s)]
*  She's seen in lives. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6339.34s)]
*  Don't forget about me, guys. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6340.34s)]
*  So I brought that up because I had been traveling the whole prior year. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6341.34s)]
*  And so she had to have... [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6344.34s)]
*  When I talked about the sit-down conversation I had with her, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6346.34s)]
*  she had a sit-down conversation with me. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6348.34s)]
*  It's like, listen, I have to go do this. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6350.34s)]
*  That's fucking amazing. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6352.34s)]
*  We have a son. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6353.34s)]
*  He's three weeks old. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6354.34s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen if I'm doing open airway surgery [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6356.34s)]
*  and we don't know what this virus is. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6359.34s)]
*  It wasn't really a question. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6361.34s)]
*  It was sort of like, I need you to step up and do this. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6363.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6367.34s)]
*  So I took our little man. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6368.34s)]
*  We already knew we were going to settle back in Ohio. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6370.34s)]
*  We had moved to Ohio late the year before. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6372.34s)]
*  She was just finishing up her residency here [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6374.34s)]
*  and happened to give birth here because that's where the doctor was. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6376.34s)]
*  So I took him and I spent... [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6378.34s)]
*  I was single father for what was going to be a few weeks. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6381.34s)]
*  But then she ended up predictably, whatever. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6384.34s)]
*  She got sick. Nobody knew what it was. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6386.34s)]
*  It wasn't a big deal. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6388.34s)]
*  Her father also got sick. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6390.34s)]
*  He was also a surgeon and was taking care of patients. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6392.34s)]
*  He ended up in the ICU. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6394.34s)]
*  She's there with a couple weeks. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6395.34s)]
*  And she continues to do open airway surgery for people who are sick. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6396.34s)]
*  Ended up being about two months where I'm playing solo single father [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6399.34s)]
*  of what was our one month to three month old son during those period of time. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6404.34s)]
*  I think it still hurts Apoorva today that she missed those two months. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6409.34s)]
*  She's not going to get it back. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6415.34s)]
*  It's such an amazing example for your son. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6416.34s)]
*  When he grows up, he'll go to appreciate it. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6418.34s)]
*  She's just shipping him breast milk during that period. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6420.34s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6423.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6424.34s)]
*  Goodness. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6425.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6426.34s)]
*  But for us, that was our conviction that she has a skill set. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6427.34s)]
*  God put her here to do it. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6432.34s)]
*  She did her job and did her duty. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6433.34s)]
*  For me, when we were two and a half or three years later, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6435.34s)]
*  I had a similar... [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6440.34s)]
*  It felt like the same conversation in reverse. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6442.34s)]
*  Go to the nation is sick. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6446.34s)]
*  And she didn't take a beat other than to say, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6447.34s)]
*  are you sure we can't do this later? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6450.34s)]
*  We talked through that. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6452.34s)]
*  And she says, great. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6453.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6455.34s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6456.34s)]
*  Question, how does that whole thing influence the way you view COVID policies, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6457.34s)]
*  how we handled everything? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6460.34s)]
*  How did that experience shape your views? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6461.34s)]
*  Is there some interesting things that happened? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6464.34s)]
*  At that time, I remember one of the most remarkable things was [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6466.34s)]
*  they were sending out mass emails to the people who were in the medical profession, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6470.34s)]
*  including in her workplace and everything else, saying, don't wear masks. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6474.34s)]
*  They're scaring people and whatever, only for a few months later to then reverse [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6479.34s)]
*  and say there's a policy. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6485.34s)]
*  So it was just people saying things with a level of certainty that they just didn't have. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6487.34s)]
*  So what in that early stage of that pandemic do we know? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6492.34s)]
*  We didn't know much. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6494.34s)]
*  We knew nothing. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6495.34s)]
*  And so we had to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6496.34s)]
*  We took the facts we had. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6498.34s)]
*  It looked even in that early phase, like even if Apoorva did get this, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6500.34s)]
*  it looked like she was going to be fine. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6503.34s)]
*  And it was the right thing for her to do. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6506.34s)]
*  We didn't know how it would affect infants. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6508.34s)]
*  We separated so that we were able to keep the infant away. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6510.34s)]
*  But my takeaway was at least if we as a government were able to... [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6513.34s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't mean to sound self-important in this way, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6519.34s)]
*  but more as a lesson learned in the way that maybe we handled it as a family, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6521.34s)]
*  if you have government leaders that say, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6525.34s)]
*  and are just honest about the fact here's what we know, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6527.34s)]
*  here's what we don't know, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6529.34s)]
*  here's the best decision we're making in the face of information that's available, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6531.34s)]
*  and here's why, I think we would have been a lot better off [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6535.34s)]
*  rather than the fake hubris of saying that we pretend to know more than we do. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6538.34s)]
*  Here's how we keep you safe. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6543.34s)]
*  Yes, even though we don't know... [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6545.34s)]
*  Where does that hubris come from? [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6547.34s)]
*  I think it comes from a belief that that's what the people need to see. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6549.34s)]
*  It's the same energy. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6552.34s)]
*  It's kind of some of the same mentality. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6554.34s)]
*  People need to see fortitude, strength, decisiveness. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6556.34s)]
*  And is the justification to avoid the chaos that would ensue [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6559.34s)]
*  if people felt that anxiety of uncertainty? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6562.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a fear of chaos. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6565.34s)]
*  They justify by going, we don't want people to feel anxious. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6567.34s)]
*  We don't want them to feel like they're... [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6570.34s)]
*  We want them to believe we know what's going on, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6572.34s)]
*  because then they can be calm while we figure this out. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6574.34s)]
*  And then they will be more likely to listen to what we need them to do [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6576.34s)]
*  when we tell them to do. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6578.34s)]
*  And I think it's actually the opposite. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6579.34s)]
*  I think they misread some of human nature. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6581.34s)]
*  Because I think actually if you just tell somebody, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6583.34s)]
*  just tell them the truth, right? [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6585.34s)]
*  Here's the truth. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6587.34s)]
*  Here's what we know, here's what we don't know. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6589.34s)]
*  But here's just the truth. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6590.34s)]
*  We're not hiding it from you. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6591.34s)]
*  But there's a delicate way that you can deliver that truth [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6592.34s)]
*  that isn't a lie but also doesn't go, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6595.34s)]
*  yo, we don't know what the fuck's going on. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6597.34s)]
*  There is a version of it which is [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6599.34s)]
*  we still need time to accurately decide what is the best way to handle this. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6601.34s)]
*  This is not relevant on the piece of how you address it. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6606.34s)]
*  This is what actually drove the lies about the origination in China, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6608.34s)]
*  worries about racism in the United States or whatever, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6611.34s)]
*  because there was anti-Asian attacks in the US. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6613.34s)]
*  I think just the right answer is we don't know for sure, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6616.34s)]
*  but it sure looks like it came from a lab in China [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6620.34s)]
*  where we were funding research that we intended to use to prevent a pandemic, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6624.34s)]
*  but things might have gone a little wrong, and we created one. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6628.34s)]
*  We as in America, you think America created it. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6631.34s)]
*  I think we funded its creation. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6634.34s)]
*  But they fucked up the stitching. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6636.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6638.34s)]
*  Someone just doors. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6639.34s)]
*  I think there's still unanswered questions. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6642.34s)]
*  I think there's still unanswered questions about what actually went down there. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6645.34s)]
*  I think we deserve the answers to that question [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6649.34s)]
*  and should hold the bad actors accountable [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6654.34s)]
*  or else we can expect even worse in the future. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6656.34s)]
*  Again, without accountability, you're doomed to repeat the same mistakes [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6658.34s)]
*  at a larger scale in the future. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6661.34s)]
*  That's what I believe. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6663.34s)]
*  But anyway, I think that that would be one of my lessons is honesty. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6664.34s)]
*  Free speech matters most not in ordinary times, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6668.34s)]
*  but in supposedly emergency times. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6671.34s)]
*  If you had been allowed to debate the lockdowns, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6674.34s)]
*  I don't think we would have locked down the schools. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6676.34s)]
*  I don't think we would have locked down the cities for nearly as long as we did. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6678.34s)]
*  If you had been allowed to debate the merits of the vaccine, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6680.34s)]
*  I don't think we would have had vaccine mandates in this country. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6682.34s)]
*  I think that autonomy is paramount in the end. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6685.34s)]
*  I think you should be able to take something even if the FDA hasn't approved it. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6691.34s)]
*  I think you shouldn't have to take something just because the FDA has approved it. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6695.34s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of learnings. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6698.34s)]
*  But I think that the irony, the ultimate tragedy in this managerial conceit, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6700.34s)]
*  this hubris, is that it'd be one thing if you actually could have pulled it off, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6706.34s)]
*  that you actually did earn the trust, even if it was based on a lie. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6712.34s)]
*  But the irony is you're in the worst of all worlds, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6717.34s)]
*  where you actually have bred greater mistrust through the act of lying itself. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6721.34s)]
*  So it loses not just on philosophical terms, which is what moves me, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6727.34s)]
*  but even on the terms of its own effectiveness, actually. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6731.34s)]
*  And so I think that that's something that, for me, is one of the great lessons. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6735.34s)]
*  The reason people don't trust the government is actually because the government doesn't trust the people. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6740.34s)]
*  And like in any relationship, trust is a two-way relationship. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6746.34s)]
*  In a marriage, in a friendship, in a work relationship, in a boss, in a CEO-employee relationship, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6750.34s)]
*  trust is a two-way relationship. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6757.34s)]
*  And I think the government is in a relationship with its people. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6760.34s)]
*  We as citizens are in a relationship with one another. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6763.34s)]
*  And I think that that trust is a two-way relationship that has been today squandered in both directions. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6765.34s)]
*  And I think that if we think about ways to heal this country, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6772.34s)]
*  two steps would, I think, go a long way towards uniting and healing this country. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6777.34s)]
*  If somebody got in the government, say a U.S. president, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6782.34s)]
*  it's what I intended to do if we got in there. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6785.34s)]
*  Apparently, that's not meant to be this time. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6787.34s)]
*  But what I hoped to do is to just rip the cord off, whatever, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6789.34s)]
*  take the band-aid off on a lot of the areas where, at least in the last 20 years, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6796.34s)]
*  you can start with the last five years, 20 years might be too far back, last five years, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6800.34s)]
*  where there's been understandable public suspicion of what we've been told. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6803.34s)]
*  And just to say, hey, here's what we know. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6807.34s)]
*  I mean, pick your favorite topic, I mean, the fringy ones, UAPs, whatever it is. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6809.34s)]
*  Here's what we know. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6813.34s)]
*  And here's what we don't. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6815.34s)]
*  Full disclosure. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6816.34s)]
*  And here's where we lied to you. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6817.34s)]
*  Like, be, I don't know, here's where we lied. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6819.34s)]
*  And I say we because even if it wasn't me, if you're the president, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6821.34s)]
*  you own what came before you. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6824.34s)]
*  You represent that. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6825.34s)]
*  You represent that. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6826.34s)]
*  Here's where we lied to you. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6827.34s)]
*  Here's why we got, here's why we lied to you. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6829.34s)]
*  I think the why is important to me, is why we lied to you. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6831.34s)]
*  And here's how we're going to ensure that never happens again. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6834.34s)]
*  And if somebody in the government, ideally the president, steps up and does that, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6837.34s)]
*  that's step one. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6840.34s)]
*  Step two is somebody in the media. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6841.34s)]
*  It doesn't have to be everybody. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6842.34s)]
*  Somebody. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6843.34s)]
*  Could be CNN, could be MSNBC, could be Fox, could be, pick your favorite one. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6844.34s)]
*  But somebody steps up and says, okay, here's where we were wrong. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6848.34s)]
*  Pick your favorite one. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6855.34s)]
*  Hunter Biden laptop, COVID origin, Nashville transgender shooter manifesto, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6856.34s)]
*  you know, January 6th, not, go straight down the list, whatever it is. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6860.34s)]
*  Here's where we lied to you. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6865.34s)]
*  Here's why we lied to you. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6866.34s)]
*  Here's where we were wrong. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6868.34s)]
*  And here's the changes we're making to ensure that doesn't happen again [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6869.34s)]
*  and to acknowledge that whatever the next thing is, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6872.34s)]
*  you're probably not going to trust me because you don't have a reason to, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6875.34s)]
*  but give us a little bit of time and I think we're going to earn your trust back [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6879.34s)]
*  and look their audience in the eye and tell them that. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6882.34s)]
*  Those two things happen, one from the White House Rose Garden [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6884.34s)]
*  and one from any mainstream trust, once trusted anchor, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6888.34s)]
*  looking their audience in the eye and saying it. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6893.34s)]
*  Those two things happen. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6895.34s)]
*  We are well on our way to healing and reuniting this country, actually. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6896.34s)]
*  It's not that hard, actually. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6901.34s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6903.34s)]
*  Real quick, there's a, yeah, I feel like there's an extreme dip in American pride. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6904.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6911.34s)]
*  And after talking to you, it makes sense because how can you be proud [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6912.34s)]
*  of a government that does not represent you and a country run by people... [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6917.34s)]
*  Doesn't trust you. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6923.34s)]
*  ...that do not trust you, right? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6924.34s)]
*  So the relationship... [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6926.34s)]
*  And how can you trust somebody who doesn't trust you? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6927.34s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6928.34s)]
*  So, yeah, because one of the questions I had for you, I was like, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6929.34s)]
*  how do we reinstill the American pride? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6932.34s)]
*  And there's a buddy of mine named Ben Yead, he's a really smart guy. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6935.34s)]
*  He's like, you know, I'm proud to be American. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6938.34s)]
*  I was like, why? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6940.34s)]
*  And he's like, this is the best version of myself. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6941.34s)]
*  That's what America has given to me, the opportunity to be the greatest version of myself. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6945.34s)]
*  I don't think there's another country in the world where I could be the best version of myself. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6949.34s)]
*  Now, this is a country that put his grandparents or was it great grandparents on it? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6954.34s)]
*  Great grandparents on it. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6958.34s)]
*  And the internment camps, right? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6959.34s)]
*  So, but he still is like the ideals of this country. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6961.34s)]
*  Sometimes we get off. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6965.34s)]
*  Yep. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6966.34s)]
*  Sometimes we wiggle. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6967.34s)]
*  And I think this is kind of what you've been speaking to. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6968.34s)]
*  Yep. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6970.34s)]
*  But the ideals are there. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6971.34s)]
*  And I think that that's something we can all have pride in. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6972.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6975.34s)]
*  When we get those right, we are the best version of ourselves. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6976.34s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6978.34s)]
*  No matter who the fuck we are. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6979.34s)]
*  I saw my mom get her citizenship and it was like really touching. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6980.34s)]
*  I got like emotional at it. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6982.34s)]
*  I saw all these people. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6983.34s)]
*  This is an emotional experience. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6984.34s)]
*  I wish people could go see the excitement that is there when these people are realizing [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6985.34s)]
*  this dream because it is a fucking dream. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6991.34s)]
*  Totally. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6993.34s)]
*  And maybe they're looking at America in the best possible way, maybe looking at those [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6994.34s)]
*  ideals, maybe looking at what that constitution represents. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=6998.34s)]
*  But if this managerial class, who is not necessarily doing it with nefarious intent, and that's [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7001.34s)]
*  a really important thing. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7007.34s)]
*  It's benevolent. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7008.34s)]
*  It's benevolent conceit. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7009.34s)]
*  There it is. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7010.34s)]
*  If they are either removed or moved out of the way or there is a way to execute it where [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7011.34s)]
*  they have utility but not disruption. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7017.14s)]
*  I think that could be really- [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7019.34s)]
*  I'm pretty sparse and libertarian in my tendency to believe that the way to do this is just [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7021.34s)]
*  through publicly accountable elected officials, actually. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7026.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7028.34s)]
*  And we'll get a better class of public elected official once that actually becomes clear [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7029.34s)]
*  to everybody how important that is. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7033.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think that makes sense. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7034.34s)]
*  Versus if that's unimportant, then you get the C team that you're getting right now. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7035.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7039.34s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7040.34s)]
*  This is a step to uniting this country. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7041.34s)]
*  It's also part of even when you think about the elections meaning something. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7042.34s)]
*  And this is the more philosophical underpinning of why I favor- so I favor this because I [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7044.34s)]
*  think it quells any of the concern about election integrity. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7049.34s)]
*  But there's a deeper element to this, too, of our elections meaning something. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7052.34s)]
*  That civic ritual that your mother and you as a family, sounds like, went through. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7055.34s)]
*  I favor- that's why I favor single day voting on election day. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7060.34s)]
*  Make it a national holiday. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7064.34s)]
*  And do it with the way the Iowa caucus has done with paper ballots and government issued [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7066.34s)]
*  ID. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7070.34s)]
*  There's the election integrity concerns. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7071.34s)]
*  I favor making English the sole language that appears on a ballot. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7072.34s)]
*  Many people find that controversial. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7076.34s)]
*  But we are a nation founded on ideals. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7077.34s)]
*  But who are we if we can't even communicate those ideals with one another? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7081.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7084.34s)]
*  I think that one of the things that's dividing this country to breaking point is just we're [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7085.34s)]
*  innate as human beings. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7087.34s)]
*  We distrust one another when people are speaking a language you don't understand. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7088.34s)]
*  They can speak that language, but if you don't share that language in common, at least [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7092.34s)]
*  on the day that you're expressing the civic ritual. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7096.34s)]
*  And by the way, all of this goes to the concerns about election integrity anyway. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7098.34s)]
*  And one of the things I've said leading the Republican Party is if we get single day voting [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7101.34s)]
*  on election day as a national holiday with paper ballots, government ID, and English [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7105.34s)]
*  as the sole language on a ballot, I will pledge- and we have to be, we're just done complaining [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7109.34s)]
*  about election integrity or results or whatever. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7114.34s)]
*  And we move the country forward, but we do it with the civic ritual that gives us a sense [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7116.34s)]
*  of appreciation of that set of ideals that the country was founded on. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7120.34s)]
*  Are we perfect? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7126.34s)]
*  No, we're not. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7127.34s)]
*  Have we ever been perfect? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7128.34s)]
*  No, we're not. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7129.34s)]
*  And we're going to keep fucking up. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7130.34s)]
*  Yes, because we are men, not gods. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7131.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7133.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7134.34s)]
*  God. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7135.34s)]
*  We're a nation- [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7136.34s)]
*  God. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7137.34s)]
*  We're men, not God. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7138.34s)]
*  And we are still a nation founded on ideals. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7141.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7145.34s)]
*  So those two things, by definition, it's like a math equation. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7146.34s)]
*  It's like an axiomatic, you have the axioms and the corollary. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7150.34s)]
*  Those two things are the axioms, that we are fallen human beings, not God, and that we [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7154.34s)]
*  are still founded on a set of ideals that we aspire to. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7160.34s)]
*  Then the necessary logical consequence of that is that we will always fall short of [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7166.34s)]
*  our ideals. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7171.34s)]
*  But let me aspire. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7172.34s)]
*  But aspire to. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7173.34s)]
*  If you take away my ability to aspire by having this major class that's going to dictate [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7174.34s)]
*  exactly what I can do, now you're taking away my pride. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7178.34s)]
*  Let me strive and fail sooner than you have me optically succeed. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7181.34s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7186.34s)]
*  It is optic success. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7187.34s)]
*  It's the illusion. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7189.34s)]
*  Because that's how they get the pat on the back. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7191.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7193.34s)]
*  Look what these people did. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7194.34s)]
*  I told you I was right. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7195.34s)]
*  Look how good I am at managing. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7196.34s)]
*  I appreciate you having what seems like, to me, reflecting a deep understanding of my [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7197.34s)]
*  worldview in a short amount of time. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7201.34s)]
*  Because actually, this, I think what you just said. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7203.34s)]
*  I think it's important to be explained in this way. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7205.34s)]
*  That's why Deep State is such a buzzword that people hear, and they have all these ideas [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7207.34s)]
*  wrapped around it that might not actually be what you're saying, even if they mean the [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7212.34s)]
*  same thing. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7215.34s)]
*  I think when people think of Deep State, they're like, Nancy Pelosi's in a room, and she's [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7216.34s)]
*  saying, hey, FBI, go do this, and let's bomb that shit. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7219.34s)]
*  And that's the Deep State. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7222.34s)]
*  And various intentions. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7223.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7224.34s)]
*  Whereas managerial class. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7225.34s)]
*  As opposed to just the slow motion reality is far more boring in nature, actually. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7226.34s)]
*  The reality of what we perceive as evil intent is always far more boring. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7230.34s)]
*  Always. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7236.34s)]
*  If I look at you as just a CEO who would be elected president and remove the bureaucracy, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7237.34s)]
*  that's a very different thing than a guy who's going to tackle the Deep State. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7242.34s)]
*  That sounds so abstract. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7245.34s)]
*  If I look at you as like, oh, this is a CEO who built, he's a billionaire, lowercase [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7246.34s)]
*  B, uppercase B, don't matter, off of this thing, and he's going to help the United [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7250.34s)]
*  States government run more officially and in our best interests. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7255.34s)]
*  That's fucking... [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7258.34s)]
*  What was up with the mega donors you were saying? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7259.34s)]
*  Oh, I was just going to say that. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7261.34s)]
*  Yeah, so it's sort of this dynamic where there's like a courtship and an expectation that you [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7263.34s)]
*  supplicate yourself that I was just very bad at because I couldn't put my heart into it [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7272.34s)]
*  at any point in time. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7277.34s)]
*  And so if there's a next time, and I didn't really do much of it this time, and that's [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7278.34s)]
*  why... [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7281.34s)]
*  Can you give an example? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7282.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7283.34s)]
*  I mean, I think the... [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7284.34s)]
*  Name would be great. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7285.34s)]
*  The handwritten notes, the ability, the idea that people believe that you got to fly to [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7286.34s)]
*  where they are to see them to some donor retreat. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7292.34s)]
*  They summoned every candidate. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7295.34s)]
*  Actually, by the end of it, they didn't summon me, but they summoned the DeSantis and Haley [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7296.34s)]
*  and Scott campaigns to figure out how there was going to be a discussion about who was [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7300.34s)]
*  actually going to take on Trump. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7304.34s)]
*  It's sort of... [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7306.34s)]
*  Who are they? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7307.34s)]
*  Who are they? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7308.34s)]
*  Just like the Koch brothers? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7309.34s)]
*  A lot of wealthy people in the Republican, frankly, in both parties. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7310.34s)]
*  Peter Thiel. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7313.34s)]
*  No, he didn't play this time. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7314.34s)]
*  He didn't play this time. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7315.34s)]
*  But he's always involved, right? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7316.34s)]
*  I think this time he wasn't. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7317.34s)]
*  I like that verb, but he didn't play this time. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7318.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7319.34s)]
*  It is a game. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7320.34s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a game, man. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7321.34s)]
*  So who's one of the people that was playing... [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7322.34s)]
*  I mean, you could look at actually one of the most interesting twists right now. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7325.34s)]
*  One of the most interesting twists is, you know, some of the biggest donors, because [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7331.34s)]
*  it shows you how bipartisan this is. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7335.34s)]
*  You know, the biggest donors to Nikki Haley include the very people who have been actually [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7336.34s)]
*  funding to keep Donald Trump off the ballot from a left-wing perspective. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7341.34s)]
*  So like Reid Hoffman is one such person. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7346.34s)]
*  And he's the founder of LinkedIn, which, by the way, censored me early in this campaign [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7350.34s)]
*  for making factual statements about climate change. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7354.34s)]
*  And then they said it violated their policies on hate speech, misinformation, and violence. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7357.34s)]
*  When we challenged them on what was inaccurate about it after we shared it with... [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7361.34s)]
*  We just shared our email exchanges with the New York Post, which printed it. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7366.34s)]
*  And then Microsoft then comes out and says, I don't know, your account was locked in error, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7369.34s)]
*  which is funny. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7373.34s)]
*  It makes it sound like a technical glitch. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7374.34s)]
*  That's just a funny side story. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7375.34s)]
*  But this is the type of stuff that happens behind the scenes. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7377.34s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7380.34s)]
*  This guy's funding Nikki Haley in an attempt to do what exactly? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7381.34s)]
*  I used to have her beat Donald Trump in the primary. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7384.34s)]
*  I think the idea would be she's much more beatable in a general election. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7386.34s)]
*  No, I don't think that's the idea at all, actually. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7390.34s)]
*  I think the idea is she's actually going to be more effective than Biden at advancing certain [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7392.34s)]
*  of the agendas, actually. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7397.34s)]
*  But does he support... [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7398.34s)]
*  And then the Democratic brand is kind of tarnished right now. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7399.34s)]
*  And if they get Biden, he's started to lose his use as the leader of their pawn on the [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7402.34s)]
*  chessboard. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7407.34s)]
*  But then they got this thing called the Kamala Harris problem. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7408.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7410.34s)]
*  And so once one better way to do that is, you know, the Democratic party's brand is a little tarnished. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7411.34s)]
*  We get to have the illusion of nonpartisanship. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7415.34s)]
*  Put in the fucking... [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7417.34s)]
*  Put in somebody else we can control. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7418.34s)]
*  And just all Nikki needs is to be cut in on the rake a little bit. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7419.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7422.34s)]
*  I mean, she left the government. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7423.34s)]
*  She was in debt and she quickly, you know, eight million bucks off of paid speeches, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7424.34s)]
*  military contracting firms. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7430.34s)]
*  Tell me how these politicians become millionaires. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7431.34s)]
*  Yeah, mostly getting paid. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7434.34s)]
*  You know, we make it sound really nefarious under the table, but it's basically under the table. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7437.34s)]
*  So there are under the table deals made. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7442.34s)]
*  But they're actually hiding... [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7444.34s)]
*  Many of them are just hiding in plain sight. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7445.34s)]
*  So it's my belief that if you have done favors for Boeing to the tune of 900 million or nine [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7446.34s)]
*  figure sums of money, hundreds of millions of dollars in the state of South Carolina [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7453.34s)]
*  showering on Boeing, that it would be inappropriate and undesirable for you to take as one of [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7457.34s)]
*  your first paid seats after you leave government to sit on Boeing's board where they have a [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7462.34s)]
*  nice warm seat waiting for you. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7466.34s)]
*  That's exactly what Nikhila does. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7468.34s)]
*  Or I think it would be inappropriate if you're representing the US at the United Nations [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7470.34s)]
*  and you abruptly step off as your family's wallowing in debt for you to be able to start [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7475.34s)]
*  a military contracting firm that exploits your connections at the UN to advocate for [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7479.34s)]
*  policies that allow a military contracting firm to make more money, which is indeed those [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7483.34s)]
*  that are hawkish or pro-war policies. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7487.34s)]
*  That's exactly what she does. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7489.34s)]
*  Or give paid speeches to foreign actors without disclosing what those speeches are. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7490.34s)]
*  But it's not just Nikhila. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7494.34s)]
*  I mean, I think if you're the vice president of the United States, I don't think your son [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7495.34s)]
*  should be sitting on the board of a Ukrainian company collecting $5 million when he doesn't [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7498.34s)]
*  have the first qualification to do it. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7501.34s)]
*  Especially if you then become the president and fork over $200 billion of money to Ukraine. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7503.34s)]
*  If you're Elizabeth Warren, nobody has any idea. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7507.34s)]
*  Everybody knows what her salary is, her and her husband's included. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7509.34s)]
*  And a few hundred thousand dollars a year, they got expenses. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7513.34s)]
*  And suddenly her net worth is disclosed to be $68 million. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7517.34s)]
*  That math doesn't add up. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7522.34s)]
*  That math does not add up. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7523.34s)]
*  And it's just across the board in both parties. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7524.34s)]
*  This is how it works. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7526.34s)]
*  And so my own view is if you're in Congress, you shouldn't be allowed to trade individual stocks. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7527.34s)]
*  Neither should any of the bureaucrats. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7531.34s)]
*  Or your husband. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7533.34s)]
*  Yeah, in your orbit. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7534.34s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7536.34s)]
*  I don't think you should be allowed to lobby the government for at least 10 years. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7537.34s)]
*  I mean, maybe if you really aspire to a life career as a lobbyist, at least wait 10 years. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7540.34s)]
*  Explain how that happens. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7545.34s)]
*  So basically they leave government and then they get paid by these lobbyists. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7547.34s)]
*  By industry to represent them to go after their own, to get open the doors to their own prior colleagues. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7551.34s)]
*  I don't think that if you've done special favors for a company like showering hundreds of millions of dollars on them, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7557.34s)]
*  you should be able to join the board of that company. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7563.34s)]
*  Which again would create maybe the illusion that you knew that they were going to do that for you at the time you were showering $100 million. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7565.34s)]
*  What about the speeches? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7572.34s)]
*  Or if you're the regulator, if you're at the FDA, I don't think you should be able to join the board of a pharmaceutical company afterwards. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7574.34s)]
*  This is random. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7580.34s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7581.34s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7582.34s)]
*  But I feel like one version, because I was looking into this a little bit. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7583.34s)]
*  I kind of want to do a piece on this. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7585.34s)]
*  But the way that a lot of them make their money after they're in government is through these speeches. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7587.34s)]
*  So do you think somebody really wanted to pay seven figures to hear Nikki Haley speak? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7594.34s)]
*  Forget Nikki Haley. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7598.34s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7599.34s)]
*  This is one of the most boring individuals. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7600.34s)]
*  You're talking about half a million dollars. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7602.34s)]
*  In some cases, we're talking seven figure. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7605.34s)]
*  At least in one of these cases, seven figure. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7608.34s)]
*  But we know the entire country doesn't like hearing her talk. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7610.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7613.34s)]
*  Right? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7614.34s)]
*  So maybe it's not for the talk. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7615.34s)]
*  Right. That's the whole point. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7616.34s)]
*  That's right. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7617.34s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7618.34s)]
*  And is that their way of scratching the backs? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7619.34s)]
*  Of course it is. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7621.34s)]
*  It's one of the tools. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7622.34s)]
*  It's not the only tool. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7623.34s)]
*  It's not explicitly said, but it's basically like, okay, you do this for us. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7624.34s)]
*  And then when you're done running, when you're out of office, we have seven speeches lined up. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7626.34s)]
*  Give your same stupid speech. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7631.34s)]
*  Nobody's even fucking listening. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7633.34s)]
*  And again, it's like a game theoretic thing where I don't think in most cases that's verbalized. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7634.34s)]
*  Yeah, just you understand that's how the game is played. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7638.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7641.34s)]
*  And it just, and the beat goes on. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7642.34s)]
*  That's it. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7643.34s)]
*  Okay. What about Kushner getting that $2 billion deal from MBS? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7644.34s)]
*  What deal is that? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7648.34s)]
*  In terms of investing in a fund? [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7649.34s)]
*  He is a track record investor. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7650.34s)]
*  He's a track record investor. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7652.34s)]
*  I don't know what went down. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7653.34s)]
*  But apparently the Saudi fund- [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7654.34s)]
*  I mean, people have criticized Mnuchin. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7655.34s)]
*  I don't know what he's doing. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7656.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7659.34s)]
*  My view is just across the board. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7660.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7662.34s)]
*  Across the board. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7663.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7664.34s)]
*  Certainly for people in Congress or the US Senate. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7665.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7666.34s)]
*  Let's just start with that because these are the people who should be accountable to the [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7667.34s)]
*  people at large anyway. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7670.34s)]
*  I mean, it seems like an absolute no-brainer. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7671.34s)]
*  Now here's the concern. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7672.34s)]
*  If, and this is an ethical dilemma, of course, because what I'm going to suggest you could [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7674.34s)]
*  do is unethical. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7681.34s)]
*  But if you cannot get rich in politics, will the smart people- [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7682.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7691.34s)]
*  Not want to enter politics? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7692.34s)]
*  So here's what I would say is I think the term limits are good. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7694.08s)]
*  I think you should get in there and get out. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7696.860000000001s)]
*  Which is what it used to be. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7698.5s)]
*  That's the idea here. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7699.5s)]
*  I want eight years. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7700.5s)]
*  So if I can't work for the people for more than eight years as their president, I don't [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7701.5s)]
*  want the people reporting in to me to generally work for them for more than eight years either. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7703.68s)]
*  Get in, get out. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7706.7s)]
*  Three terms is the limit for Congress. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7707.84s)]
*  Two terms is the limit for the Senate. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7709.28s)]
*  And I think that I would sooner have a discussion about increasing the salary. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7712.02s)]
*  I don't think somebody should be forced to be poor or even have to live where they send [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7715.1s)]
*  their kids to school. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7719.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7720.9800000000005s)]
*  But I would rather than just tell us what it is in the open rather than having to do the [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7721.9800000000005s)]
*  underhand deal with them. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7724.54s)]
*  They didn't pay me enough anyway. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7725.54s)]
*  I'm just going to do it this way. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7726.54s)]
*  And so I think that that's a reasonable thing to do. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7727.54s)]
*  Term limits, most of these people wouldn't vote for term limits. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7729.780000000001s)]
*  Here's my solution on that is it's shameful, but it would work. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7731.66s)]
*  It would work in a heartbeat. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7735.46s)]
*  If I was president, we would have gotten this done is grandfathering the people. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7736.46s)]
*  And we got the final deal. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7741.3s)]
*  We got it all lined up. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7742.3s)]
*  You don't want to vote for it. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7743.3s)]
*  We'll grandfather you in. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7744.3s)]
*  Meaning you can you. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7745.3s)]
*  You're not subject to term limits. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7746.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7747.3s)]
*  The guy who comes after you. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7748.3s)]
*  And they would do it in a heartbeat. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7749.3s)]
*  They would do it in a heartbeat. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7750.3s)]
*  Because it's a wildly popular policy. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7751.3s)]
*  And so and the same thing with the insider trading bans. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7754.38s)]
*  Most congressmen hate it when I talk about banning trading. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7756.98s)]
*  Not for you Pelosi. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7759.94s)]
*  You have to say that otherwise they would never pass it. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7760.94s)]
*  So we got the deal lined up and we'll just say. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7764.7s)]
*  They get the virtue signal. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7766.26s)]
*  But you can't make it nakedly self-interested. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7767.780000000001s)]
*  You would say out of out of out of respect for the continuation of prior norms, this [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7769.860000000001s)]
*  will begin on a date certain in the year 2030 or whatever. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7775.780000000001s)]
*  But that's like that's kind of how it would have to go. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7779.34s)]
*  Actually. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7781.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7782.900000000001s)]
*  And so and they would do it because it's a wildly popular policy. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7783.900000000001s)]
*  Let's assume all these things happen and it works. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7785.46s)]
*  Who plots the long term course of America if people are getting elected or reelected [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7788.18s)]
*  every two, six, four years? [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7794.54s)]
*  The long term court like who is making deals that are going to impact our grandchild's [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7797.18s)]
*  futures? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7802.780000000001s)]
*  Because that's an important thing. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7804.06s)]
*  I think that with this set up in the term limits, etc. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7805.22s)]
*  So this is the question, right? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7809.38s)]
*  And I think it's it's the best argument for it's the best argument for the thing that [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7812.5s)]
*  I'm against. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7816.3s)]
*  That's still against it. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7817.3s)]
*  Because I think that you will then select for the kind of leader that is viewing it [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7819.860000000001s)]
*  as a temporary form of public service. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7824.46s)]
*  And the job of that leader is to think on the time scales of history rather than the [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7828.62s)]
*  time scales of tomorrow if they're doing their job right. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7833.46s)]
*  And it puts accountability back on the people to elect such a person back to what Thomas [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7837.14s)]
*  Jefferson said, the people elect the government they deserve. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7841.06s)]
*  OK, so break this down to me real quick. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7843.66s)]
*  You will you think that because the country is now truly in the hands of the government [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7845.5s)]
*  that are selected and not in this managerial class, that all of a sudden their viewpoints [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7851.1s)]
*  for the country will then transform? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7855.38s)]
*  It should. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7857.780000000001s)]
*  The people should elect such people. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7858.780000000001s)]
*  And if not, we got what we deserved. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7859.9400000000005s)]
*  Just like in your personal financial life. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7862.820000000001s)]
*  And then we're OK with that. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7864.3s)]
*  We have to live with that. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7865.3s)]
*  We have to live with that. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7866.3s)]
*  And that's for better or worse. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7867.3s)]
*  That was the that's what was 1776 was fought for. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7868.3s)]
*  Now, as much as I might agree with this, do you think that Americans like the cozy security [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7870.700000000001s)]
*  of a managerial class maintaining the price of oil under four bucks a gallon? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7877.58s)]
*  Right now, maybe we are. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7882.82s)]
*  Do they want that risk in their life? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7884.18s)]
*  So here's the here's the thing we live in right now is you're offering the best statement [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7886.58s)]
*  of that other side's view. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7889.5s)]
*  Right now, we live in the worst of all worlds. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7892.58s)]
*  Yeah, we're actually people are seeing how that has ruined their own lives. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7894.54s)]
*  Managerial class sucks. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7897.1s)]
*  Yeah, and they've actually left. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7898.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7900.1s)]
*  So the hard case presents itself when those come into conflict, which is a philosophical [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7901.1s)]
*  case. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7905.0199999999995s)]
*  That's not where we are right now. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7906.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that's what now makes for the right moment to tear the thing down anyway. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7907.46s)]
*  But I do think that in a psychological sense, we have become a nation of sheep. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7912.14s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7916.38s)]
*  And I think a nation of sheep is what breeds this managerial class of wolves, actually. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7917.38s)]
*  And so I think you get what you deserve anyway. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7922.14s)]
*  It's a two way. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7923.9400000000005s)]
*  Just as trust is a two way relationship, we don't trust one direction or the other. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7924.9400000000005s)]
*  Once you do adopt this nation of sheep, you know, waking up two legged higher mammals, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7927.46s)]
*  doing our diversity, doing what our iPhones tell us to do on a given day, you know, making [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7935.26s)]
*  our way across an American terrain. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7939.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you kind of get the government that feeds you and creates more of that in return. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7941.900000000001s)]
*  And it's up to us to declare independence. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7948.660000000001s)]
*  And so when I say things like the other night, as I said, we live in a 1776 moment. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7951.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7957.08s)]
*  It's our time to declare independence, not just from the managerial class, but even from [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7958.08s)]
*  within that inner prison within each of us too, that has confined us by the tools of [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7962.02s)]
*  the managerial class, including, but not limited to the algorithmification of our modern life. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7968.620000000001s)]
*  That's a whole separate discussion for another day. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7973.900000000001s)]
*  But I think that we live in a moment where it's time for a modern declaration of independence [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7976.820000000001s)]
*  of the forces that have shackled us on the exterior and the interior. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7982.740000000001s)]
*  And those, it's not a coincidence that those two things happen at the same time. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7987.540000000001s)]
*  They actually go together. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7990.22s)]
*  And so I think each of us, I mean, we talked about this at governmental level, but I think [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7992.3s)]
*  each of us has an inner sheep and an inner lion. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7994.860000000001s)]
*  And I think right now the inner sheep has, is winning the day, mostly, at least across [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=7998.06s)]
*  our general population level. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8004.12s)]
*  And it's partly because we've been lulled into that by having the comfort of the fact [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8005.9800000000005s)]
*  that we're not accountable for our decisions, but somebody else's. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8010.860000000001s)]
*  And so might as well give in to my sheep-like tendencies rather than my lion-like tendencies. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8014.12s)]
*  Or, yeah, I mean, it's good to phrase it like that because we all obviously want to be a [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8021.4s)]
*  lion, but I think at the end of the day, people really truly do want security and they're [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8025.12s)]
*  willing to sacrifice some freedom for security. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8029.84s)]
*  Now I'm not saying that that's- [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8032.64s)]
*  And right now we're getting neither. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8034.0s)]
*  But is where we're at right now. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8035.0s)]
*  And I think that's the most important thing. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8036.0s)]
*  Right now practically speaking, it's a wrap. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8037.76s)]
*  You sacrifice your security for this idea of freedom, but you've actually had your freedom [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8038.76s)]
*  further restricted because now you're not represented in any way at all. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8044.400000000001s)]
*  So now you have nothing. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8048.08s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8049.08s)]
*  We still live in fucking America. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8050.08s)]
*  But I hear what you're saying. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8052.6s)]
*  But the trajectory we're on is a trajectory to nothing, yeah, is what I do believe. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8053.6s)]
*  So basically it's like, it was a fool's bet. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8058.04s)]
*  Someone told you, hey, give me a little bit of that freedom or give me a little bit of [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8060.0s)]
*  your representation. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8062.64s)]
*  I'm going to give you all the security. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8063.64s)]
*  And then you didn't get it. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8064.92s)]
*  Yep. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8065.92s)]
*  So you were lied to. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8066.92s)]
*  Which is what makes it an easy moment to drive the kind of change that I am right now where [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8068.08s)]
*  the philosophical and the practical go hand in glove together. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8070.92s)]
*  It's not a trade-off anymore. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8073.56s)]
*  If this change doesn't happen, what do you think happens to America? [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8074.56s)]
*  If we continue on the trajectory we were on, what do you say happens in 20, 30, 50 years? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8077.2s)]
*  I think we go the direction that most nations through human history have, which is to be [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8080.36s)]
*  one other, another ordinary nation in human history where the people couldn't be trusted. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8084.84s)]
*  And we sort of elegant decay into mediocrity, much like what we saw in Western Europe over [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8089.64s)]
*  the course of the last couple of centuries since the U.S. was formed, probably in a tighter [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8097.08s)]
*  time frame. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8101.56s)]
*  We need to build some more fountains. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8102.56s)]
*  I think our own culture of excellence has gone to China. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8103.56s)]
*  And I think they're in autocratic form. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8106.72s)]
*  We'll have a new, a new dominant. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8108.52s)]
*  Aren't they the epitome of the managerial class? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8109.52s)]
*  Well, they are, but they're the best version of it. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8112.12s)]
*  Because they're a benevolent managerial class? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8114.52s)]
*  No, just because that's sort of the nature of the founding of the modern state. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8116.04s)]
*  Whereas in some ways, we're a nation, we're like betraying our true essence. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8120.0s)]
*  So we're not even good at doing this managerial class thing, right? [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8126.200000000001s)]
*  So I think that's actually what's going on is we're this bastardized, mutated form of [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8129.76s)]
*  not even the thing that we are at our core. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8134.84s)]
*  So you could look at this from Mars and say that, oh, is the American model better? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8137.120000000001s)]
*  Is the Chinese model? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8140.84s)]
*  And it's like, well, no one's up. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8141.84s)]
*  Didn't we inspire their model? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8143.240000000001s)]
*  A Martian might say that one is, you know, that these are two different models. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8145.04s)]
*  But at least one model is being itself. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8149.72s)]
*  The communist Chinese government was the one that Mao Zedong set into motion. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8152.5599999999995s)]
*  But we're not the one that George Washington set into motion. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8157.16s)]
*  And so it's in some ways the worst of all worlds is it's a betrayal of what the thing [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8159.84s)]
*  actually was. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8165.32s)]
*  Yeah, because that Martian can't actually look at what we're supposed to be and make [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8166.32s)]
*  that judgment. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8170.04s)]
*  But couldn't you say that the Chinese government or a lot of these governments, even like Russia, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8171.04s)]
*  you can look at Turkey, aren't they a reflection of American influence in a way? [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8175.5599999999995s)]
*  Some of them are. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8179.8s)]
*  So we basically tell the world, yo, let your people vote. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8181.16s)]
*  And then we get in there like, all right, we'll influence this election. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8183.62s)]
*  We got you. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8187.4s)]
*  So we're not giving away potential true democracy. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8188.4s)]
*  That gets into more practical. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8190.4s)]
*  I'm not being nuanced with my geopolitical take here. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8194.44s)]
*  But I guess what I'm trying to say is that they, in order to maintain power or that managerial [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8196.6s)]
*  class or whatever it is, so that they can actually compete with America, they need to [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8201.039999999999s)]
*  have one group or they believe they need to have one group in charge. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8204.84s)]
*  It's the ultimate, I do not trust the people in a lot of ways. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8207.64s)]
*  That being said, I don't know. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8210.76s)]
*  I like betting on us. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8213.08s)]
*  I like betting on us. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8214.2s)]
*  I like betting on us. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8215.2s)]
*  And I'm betting on us with all I have in my life, my money and my effort and my, you know, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8216.2s)]
*  and that's what we're doing. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8220.64s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to make the ultimate bet on America. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8222.68s)]
*  Why'd it take you so fucking long to be, so maybe this is the issue. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8226.68s)]
*  It's like guys like you who are smart, thoughtful, well-read and actually really learn the topics [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8229.72s)]
*  instead of learning the buzzwords and like spitting them out there, which is great when [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8234.76s)]
*  you called out Nikki Haley. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8239.08s)]
*  She couldn't even name the three provinces that she wants us to fight for. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8240.08s)]
*  And then she could, I mean, it was just a perfect example of, she's not even nuanced [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8242.72s)]
*  on this issue at all, but what you have to go make a billion dollars in finance before [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8245.72s)]
*  you can go be in politics. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8250.64s)]
*  Now, if you're in Turkey, you're working for Erdogan, you're probably making $10 billion [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8252.8s)]
*  because he's your boy, but he's got you on his hip like this guy's fucking good and we [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8257.44s)]
*  need to work. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8261.08s)]
*  I'm not saying that we should adopt that system at all. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8262.08s)]
*  That being said, how do we get more people that are like you to stop speculating and [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8264.58s)]
*  start working for the government? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8270.62s)]
*  So I'll tell you when I graduated from college, right? [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8273.14s)]
*  I was in high school when the planes hit the twin towers, I was in Cincinnati. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8276.62s)]
*  A lot of my peers, when they graduated from college or didn't even graduate from college, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8280.62s)]
*  went and served this country in the military. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8285.42s)]
*  I grew up in Cincinnati. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8288.82s)]
*  My dad was facing layoffs in the GE plant in Evendale when Jack Welch was the CEO of [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8290.140000000001s)]
*  GE, slashed about two thirds of the people in the plant where he worked. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8296.74s)]
*  He had to go to night school to keep job security. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8300.78s)]
*  For me, when I graduated from college, Bill Gates gave the commencement address at Harvard, [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8303.380000000001s)]
*  actually, when I was graduating in 2007. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8309.02s)]
*  And I was really looking forward to this. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8311.54s)]
*  He's the wealthiest man in the world at that time. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8312.54s)]
*  I'm excited to, all right, tell us how it's done. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8314.02s)]
*  And what we get is this pathetic pre-can speech about the importance of giving back. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8317.140000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, how the hell does one get the things to give back? [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8322.9s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8326.5s)]
*  He skipped that part of the speech and I listened carefully and you didn't tell me. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8328.300000000001s)]
*  But I was unapologetically gonna say, all right, I'm gonna do it honestly, gonna do [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8332.1s)]
*  it the right way through hard work and hopefully creating valuable things. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8336.78s)]
*  But I'm in this to get ahead as a capitalist. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8341.18s)]
*  And I don't regret that decision. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8344.380000000001s)]
*  But I think that there's a side to each of us that is also hungry to be part of something [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8347.1s)]
*  bigger than ourselves. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8353.26s)]
*  So each of us as an American, I think, is the capitalist, but is the citizen too. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8354.34s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8359.140000000001s)]
*  And so as long as I think we create the space for us to have, this gets super practical, [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8359.82s)]
*  but I'd be the advice I'd give young people is don't think of your career as one thing. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8364.54s)]
*  Think of it as like a storybook with a bunch of different chapters. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8371.1s)]
*  And I think if we are sort of think about the structure of life in that sense, as opposed [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8374.26s)]
*  right now there's three chapters in life. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8379.460000000001s)]
*  One is education, then there's career, then there's retirement. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8381.86s)]
*  Actually, one of the companies I found, it's actually doing pretty well. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8386.74s)]
*  It's in New York City, it's not far from here. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8388.66s)]
*  It's actually doing really well, it's called Chapter. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8390.02s)]
*  It was about that third chapter in life and it ended up becoming, getting into the Medicare [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8391.9s)]
*  plan selection space. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8397.14s)]
*  It started with a grand vision of redefining the third chapter, but it ended up getting [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8398.46s)]
*  very practical and the company's doing well. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8403.06s)]
*  I've always had an interest in sort of redefining that three chapter model. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8406.779999999999s)]
*  And I think that that will, in some ways as a cultural norm, help kind of make more normal [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8413.06s)]
*  the fact that you take eight years to go serve your country, even if not in the front lines [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8421.5s)]
*  in Afghanistan, in the front lines of taking on a bureaucracy. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8425.94s)]
*  And part of my best way to do that, to tell you man, is through example. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8429.699999999999s)]
*  That's why I ran for president with the hope and expectation of being successful. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8434.14s)]
*  And if that's what the people of this country want and that's what God's plan is, maybe [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8439.22s)]
*  I'll do that in the future. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8443.38s)]
*  But I think that that's probably one of the best ways to actually do it, is just by showing [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8444.38s)]
*  that it can be done. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8448.14s)]
*  It doesn't seem like you cut off your capital, you turned off your capitalist part or closed [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8449.14s)]
*  the capitalist chapter or whatever. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8453.34s)]
*  But at what point were you like, because the thing you hear, and maybe you have so much [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8454.42s)]
*  money in your matter, but do you think you hear a lot is you keep the fuck you number, [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8457.86s)]
*  the number that's enough money just keeps going up and up and up. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8461.5s)]
*  I think it's an illusion at some point in time. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8463.7s)]
*  How did you realize that? [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8466.9s)]
*  I think it was actually that 2020 year that did that for me. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8468.5s)]
*  It was kind of a wake up call. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8471.06s)]
*  A lot of things happened. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8472.06s)]
*  Karthik was born. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8473.06s)]
*  I told you the story about, you know, I mean, that experience that I went through for those [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8474.06s)]
*  few months was a wake up call for me. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8478.58s)]
*  And then look at my son in the eye every day for those few months while she was on the [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8481.54s)]
*  front lines doing what she needed to do. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8485.060000000001s)]
*  And then it was a few months after that, two months after that, that the whole George Floyd [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8487.580000000002s)]
*  thing played out and the thing I talked about in Woke Inc. that, you know, my own company, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8491.660000000002s)]
*  there's weird stuff going on that I hadn't thought about in cross corporate America relating [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8496.740000000002s)]
*  to this new ideology that for me, the combination of those things happening in a very short [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8501.34s)]
*  period of time was kind of my call to action. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8506.5s)]
*  And I think it probably organically takes everybody to have their own version of that [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8511.06s)]
*  to really authentically do it as opposed to just doing it by rote. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8515.34s)]
*  But I also think that if we created a cultural norm of that, and I think this is something [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8519.859999999999s)]
*  you don't want instilled from on high, you know, Woke Inc. you haven't gone to the end [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8524.88s)]
*  of the book, but I play with the idea of mandatory service. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8528.22s)]
*  I when I say I agree 95% of the things that are in there, I'm not, I don't think that's [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8531.539999999999s)]
*  actually the right answer because once you mandate it, it loses the quality of actually [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8536.76s)]
*  being service. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8540.2s)]
*  But I do think that's at least at the very least doing it through inspiration, I think [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8542.44s)]
*  is something that is strictly positive. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8549.36s)]
*  And that's what I hoped to achieve as the next president. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8553.12s)]
*  I hope in some small measure, we achieve that even through the campaign itself, but I'm [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8559.0s)]
*  not done. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8564.820000000002s)]
*  And so the answer to that question is important to me. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8566.58s)]
*  And I don't have the clear answer other than agreeing with you that it needs to happen [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8570.4s)]
*  in this country. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8576.22s)]
*  And, you know, the best way is you can't, it's easy, it's always easy to force other [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8577.22s)]
*  people to do something. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8581.16s)]
*  It's a lot harder to do something than up and step up and do it yourself. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8582.16s)]
*  And so instead of pointing it, how can we get a country where other people do it? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8585.74s)]
*  Maybe you just take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself to, to maybe do what [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8590.24s)]
*  you demand of others. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8594.24s)]
*  And that's what the last year was about for me. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8595.52s)]
*  And I hope with some reflection, I haven't decided what I'm going to do next, but take [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8599.74s)]
*  some time on this one. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8603.18s)]
*  You don't get dealt a blank slate very often. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8605.060000000001s)]
*  So I want to take, take full advantage of that. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8607.34s)]
*  But whatever I do next, hopefully will be guided by that same spirit of wanting to practice [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8610.380000000001s)]
*  what I preach a little bit. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8617.800000000001s)]
*  And so whatever that is, we'll see where it goes. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8619.300000000001s)]
*  Vivek, I am, yeah, I'm very, I'm very happy we got to sit down with you, man. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8621.7s)]
*  I'm glad. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8626.480000000001s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8627.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, appreciate it. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8628.480000000001s)]
*  It's good to, yeah, it's good to use, I think, platforms like this where you get this long [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8629.480000000001s)]
*  time to really explain. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8633.68s)]
*  It's a tough game. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8636.2s)]
*  It's a tough game, that politics, this 30 second soundbites trying to get everything [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8637.2s)]
*  out. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8640.2s)]
*  But I'm really glad that you got to explain everything because I feel like I understand [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8641.2s)]
*  your ethos way better. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8645.220000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8646.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8647.6s)]
*  And I think I see it through, through those lenses. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8648.6s)]
*  So thank you very much, guys. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8650.82s)]
*  Give it up for Vivek Ramaswamy, future vice president of the United States of America. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8651.82s)]
*  Maybe president one day. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuQxVICWzg&t=8656.82s)]
