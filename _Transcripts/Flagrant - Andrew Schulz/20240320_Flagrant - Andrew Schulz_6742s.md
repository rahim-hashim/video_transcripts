*  Because I don't think people realize this, you almost died. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2.12s)]
*  Take me through the whole thing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2.62s)]
*  I'm riding on my four-wheeler, and I'm [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3.66s)]
*  about to turn in my driveway. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5.66s)]
*  Just so happened, this lady behind, I never, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6.92s)]
*  I didn't know she was even behind me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  She tried to go around me. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=10.58s)]
*  Boom, hit me, and I flew. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=12.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=13.88s)]

*  When she's like, oh, shit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  I knew I looked crazy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  First thing I called Clowns, I'm being a weird chef forever [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=29.799999999999997s)]

*  For real, for real. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=37.16s)]
*  You know how much I hate this city? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=38.84s)]
*  I love the people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=41.72s)]
*  You do hate New York, but why? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=42.68s)]
*  I love the people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=44.56s)]
*  It's just the city. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=45.4s)]
*  I always had bad luck here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=46.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=47.32s)]
*  Every time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=47.82s)]
*  Did you show them the mask you wear when you walk around? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=48.76s)]
*  Oh, y'all ain't seen it? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=51.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=51.92s)]
*  He's walking around. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=52.28s)]
*  This guy's a fucking lunatic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Wait, which mask is he? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  He goes, I don't want people to notice me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  So he's just wearing like an old man mask. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=57.36s)]
*  What about the chihuahua mask? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=61.48s)]
*  I got that one, too. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=63.24s)]
*  That's my own. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  He's really in his Michael Jackson face right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=65.2s)]
*  Except if you took it off, less people would notice. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=71.36s)]
*  Why are you waving at me? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=78.24s)]
*  Wait, you're doing this to not get noticed? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=79.32s)]
*  No. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=81.4s)]
*  Well, I do this so I can walk around and nobody pay me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=82.92s)]
*  I'm just doing it for the camera right now, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=85.72s)]
*  but usually if I walk around, nobody pay me no attention. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=87.04s)]
*  But say the real reason. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=89.2s)]
*  Because this is the safest person in New York, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=90.48s)]
*  an old white man. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  A giant baby? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=98.92s)]
*  Can I see that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=99.76s)]
*  An old white man. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  It's not an old white man. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=101.4s)]
*  They're looking at you and they're going, give me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=102.48s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=104.76s)]
*  What the? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  What's wrong with it? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=106.2s)]
*  Nobody's fooled by that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=107.28s)]
*  Do you think people are fooled? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  You look like a goblin. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=110.48s)]
*  Your hands are black. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  I put my hands in my pocket. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  It's just for the camera, man. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=113.4s)]
*  But you're wearing a blinged out watch. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=114.72s)]
*  You can't see the watch in this one. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=116.64s)]
*  I just put that for the camera. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=118.48s)]
*  But if I'm walking around normal, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  let me show you me walking around normal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=121.36s)]
*  You think white people look like that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  You think that's walking around normal? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=123.48s)]
*  Yes, without the skull cap. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=124.92s)]
*  Like I told you that for the camera. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  You think the skull cap is the not normal part? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=128.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=130.44s)]
*  Let me show you me without the camera. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=131.36s)]
*  This is so racist. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=132.56s)]
*  This is what you think white people look like. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=133.4s)]
*  You really think? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  Nobody came and said nothing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Because you're in a fucking masking bubble. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  I didn't want them to see me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=140.68s)]
*  That's the whole point of it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=142.16s)]
*  I look so crazy to some people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  That makes some kind of sense. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=147.04s)]
*  That is true. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=148.07999999999998s)]

*  I even tried to wear like a regular mask [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=157.56s)]
*  and motherfuckers still notice me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=159.79999999999998s)]

*  We started. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  There's no start or finish. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=169.2s)]
*  Oh, what's happening, y'all? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  There's no start, there's no end. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=171.72s)]

*  Private airport? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=192.8s)]
*  No, that's at the regular commercial airport. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=193.64s)]
*  The peasant airport. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=196.2s)]
*  I mean. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  So they're catching you at the peasant airport? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=198.2s)]
*  All right, that's a good guess. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=202.96s)]
*  If I saw a short black-handed person [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=204.6s)]
*  wearing an old man mask at a private jet airport. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=207.32s)]

*  No, because when I was a jit-jit, we used to do that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=448.16s)]
*  No, I don't want to talk like that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=452.44s)]
*  See it? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=455.04s)]
*  No, no, I ain't doing that because we can get fucked up in a argument. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=455.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=458.8s)]
*  So I'm gonna just leave that alone. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=459.24s)]
*  So how y'all doing? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=460.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, today we are joined by the legend, the motherfucking goat, the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=461.16s)]

*  Like just to see you there, you come and see how you grew. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=473.04s)]
*  And just like he said, I saw an interview where he was talking about you, that shit [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=475.32000000000005s)]
*  real. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  Just to see you, even the bigger you get, the more you become a better man. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=478.32000000000005s)]

*  You're the inspiration, man. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=485.24s)]
*  You know I always give you credit, bro. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=486.52000000000004s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  I got to know everybody. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=488.64s)]
*  I was like, man, out of all the people that have been around me, it was a white man that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  listened to me. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=493.36s)]
*  Bro, I used to annoy him so much. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  So much. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=498.8s)]
*  Every time. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=499.4s)]
*  He's like, hey man, stop asking me so many fucking questions. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  Every day it got cold. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=503.2s)]
*  Every time we're up there, you ask me a question, ask me something. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  And you tell Charlamagne, like man, this motherfucker keep asking me shit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  Keep asking about how much I make, what you do this, how you do that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=510.12s)]
*  I mean, like man, stop asking me shit. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=513.2s)]
*  Because I figured real early that you had the game kind of figured out. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=515.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=521.24s)]
*  The game of life, he says. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=522.12s)]
*  No, not all. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=523.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=523.88s)]
*  First it was comedy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  And entertainment. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=526.68s)]
*  And then when we went to the Bahamas, I was like, oh shit. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=527.4s)]
*  Figured it out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=530.48s)]
*  You're operating on a very different level. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  But real early, I was like, oh my god, this guy has it figured out. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=534.24s)]
*  He's got his independence. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=536.68s)]
*  He's inspiring all these trends. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=538.16s)]
*  And nobody even knows outside of his community that he's starting it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=540.84s)]
*  Like even the word basic, the way that we talk about basic. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=545.96s)]
*  But there are people right now that are using it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=548.92s)]
*  My fucking wife uses a word that you popularize and has no clue it comes from you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=551.56s)]
*  So once I picked up on that early in guy code, I was just like, let me get game. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=557.6s)]
*  Like this guy has it fucking figured out. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=560.8s)]
*  But I respect people like that too because- [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=562.28s)]
*  And you told me, shut up. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=564.04s)]
*  You go, stop asking questions, just observe. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=565.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=569.2s)]
*  And I guess that's how you picked up game. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=570.76s)]
*  That's the way I tell people all the time. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=572.84s)]
*  People don't listen, they follow. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=574.56s)]
*  So you just got to give them something to follow. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=576.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=577.7199999999999s)]
*  Like most of the stuff we learn, we learn from watching people. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  Morris, we had a guy on the pod who said, Morris caught than taught. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=581.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=584.64s)]
*  You can teach all you want to, but people aren't going to listen. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=585.52s)]
*  Yeah, people not going to listen. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=587.64s)]
*  And when they do listen, they don't heard it for a fifth person. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=588.88s)]
*  But I get a kick out of that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=592.8s)]
*  Like I get a kick out of seeing people be me and they don't know it's me. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=594.04s)]
*  That's where I get my satisfaction from. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=597.92s)]
*  Like I don't get it from the flowers. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=599.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=602.64s)]
*  You get it from actually impacting culture. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=603.68s)]
*  Yeah, and seeing it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=605.3199999999999s)]
*  It's like saying, like you got a child now, when you see yourself in them, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  you get satisfaction just in that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=611.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=613.3599999999999s)]
*  So that's what I get out of people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=614.0s)]
*  I just see myself in. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  And not only just people that look like me, people like you, people like you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=617.28s)]
*  You see it in them. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=620.64s)]
*  People like you, you see them in them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  You is me. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=623.16s)]
*  So. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  No, but that's a good point. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=625.92s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  It's like if you're doing something that he started, that's more obvious. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=627.56s)]
*  When you see me do it, you're like, oh, I'm really impacting culture. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=632.0s)]
*  But that's another thing I picked up from you. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=635.8s)]
*  It was like that's all perspective. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=637.64s)]
*  A lot of people would look at that and be like, all these motherfuckers [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=639.16s)]
*  copying me and I ain't getting no credit. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=641.64s)]
*  You're giving yourself the validation. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=643.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I've always knew you can't wait on other people to give you a praise [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=646.4s)]
*  and shit like that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=651.12s)]
*  If you wait on that, you're going to be disappointed. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=651.88s)]
*  So I never relied on that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=654.12s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=655.96s)]
*  Like when people do give it to me, I damn they'll cry because I ain't used to it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=656.48s)]
*  I don't know how to take the the response, the love and shit like that, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  because I ain't used to it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  Because even when I got an accident, it was I wasn't so used to I didn't realize [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=665.24s)]
*  how many people had love for me. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=670.16s)]
*  I did like I knew I knew you had love. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=672.92s)]
*  Like I knew the people that the tribe that I got around me, I know they're going to be there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=675.4s)]
*  So that's where I got my but I didn't realize like all these people. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=680.64s)]
*  Yeah, the industry, like the people like, damn, these motherfuckers, like I really had [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=684.16s)]
*  an effect on them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=688.56s)]
*  Motherfuckers, you had people that was called. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=689.28s)]
*  I didn't expect to call me or people that was checking on me and shit like that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=691.0s)]
*  There. So that that surprised me out of that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  So what was we talking about? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=696.8s)]
*  I forget. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=699.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's just you getting your just you getting your credit and how you've [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=700.4799999999999s)]
*  created a system. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=704.28s)]
*  And this is what I think you do constantly that I really admire. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=705.56s)]
*  You create these systems where you can get the validation that you want without somebody [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  walking up to you and patting you on the back. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=713.1199999999999s)]
*  And then when they do do that is icing on the cake. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=715.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=717.56s)]
*  Oh, it's like, like I said, I don't know how to take it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=718.16s)]
*  You know, I'm saying like, shit, like people come to me and you did such a such. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=721.12s)]
*  And I probably they probably look at me like this motherfucker just looking at me crazy. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=724.64s)]
*  But I really don't be knowing what this I don't know. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=727.8s)]
*  Say thank you. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=729.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I knew I did that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  That's in my mind. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=732.48s)]
*  It's like I know it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  How did you learn that? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=735.12s)]
*  How did you learn? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=736.04s)]
*  I can't look for validation from other people giving me compliments. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=736.8s)]
*  I got to find it in other ways. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=740.8s)]
*  Well, I've always did it in a I've always did it since I was a kid and I've always had it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=742.7199999999999s)]

*  but it's kind of hard to explain, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1288.2s)]
*  because everything was going in my head so fast. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1291.52s)]
*  My life was going through my head, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1293.52s)]
*  and everything, and I was like, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1295.4s)]
*  ah shit, I fucked up. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1297.04s)]
*  Now keep in mind, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1298.32s)]
*  where he is, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1299.52s)]
*  there's no real hospital. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1301.28s)]
*  No. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1303.04s)]
*  There might not be anybody. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1303.88s)]
*  Is your old lady in the house? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  She sleep. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1306.8s)]
*  Listen. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1308.52s)]
*  So it's like, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1309.3600000000001s)]
*  you could just bleed out there. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1310.68s)]
*  He was just going to wake her up. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1311.52s)]
*  I was standing on the ground, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1312.3600000000001s)]
*  like, wait a minute, I could be there forever, right? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1313.4s)]
*  So I'm sitting there, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1315.04s)]
*  and the lady stopped, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1316.52s)]
*  and she go get my old lady. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1317.72s)]
*  And so when she go get my old lady, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1319.3600000000001s)]
*  my old lady come down, she look at me, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1321.56s)]
*  just when I knew I was really fucked up. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1322.48s)]
*  When she's like, oh shit. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1324.16s)]
*  I knew I looked crazy. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1326.52s)]
*  I knew it was. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1328.2s)]
*  And the first thing she said to her mouth was, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1329.32s)]
*  oh, you got all your teeth. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1331.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1333.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1334.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1335.16s)]
*  Just like right before that, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1336.0s)]
*  the day before that, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1337.16s)]
*  I had said some shit about people, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1338.0s)]
*  old people that got back teeth, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1339.84s)]
*  I got all my back teeth. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1341.28s)]
*  So I was talking shit about teeth, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1342.64s)]
*  and so she was thinking this was like that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1344.48s)]
*  Like, man, fuck out of here, woo woo woo. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1346.68s)]
*  So the first thing I tried to, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1348.68s)]
*  I called Clay. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1349.8000000000002s)]
*  First thing I called Clay, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1351.2s)]
*  I was like, man, I fucked up, bro. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1352.0400000000002s)]
*  I was like, this shit over, man. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1354.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I knew. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1355.8000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1356.64s)]
*  It was a death call. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1357.48s)]
*  Yeah, I was like. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1358.3200000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1359.16s)]
*  I knew I was like, I'm being a weird chef forever now. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1360.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm being a weird chef forever now. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1361.88s)]
*  So right through that whole time laying on the ground, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1363.68s)]
*  I was laying on the ground for a long time. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1366.1200000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you later, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1367.92s)]
*  but I was going through all the money I had. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1368.76s)]
*  I started saying what I can't do no more. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1371.92s)]
*  You just start thinking about all, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1375.24s)]
*  like I say, like you said before, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1376.92s)]
*  I prepared myself for everything. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1379.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  So right then I was preparing myself for being handicapped [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1381.24s)]
*  and not having no, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1383.4399999999998s)]
*  be able to go on the road no more. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1385.3999999999999s)]
*  All that shit, I had it all in my head. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1388.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1389.84s)]

*  I don't even want to talk about it [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1392.24s)]
*  because it's going to make me cry. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1393.08s)]

*  Nah, so, well, when it happened, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1400.9199999999998s)]
*  I kept telling him, kept telling Clay, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1403.52s)]
*  now fuck, he like, nah, you're going to get through this shit. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1406.48s)]

*  For real, for real. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1411.72s)]
*  I don't want to talk about this shit, bro. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1413.92s)]
*  Nah, it's beautiful, man. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1415.3600000000001s)]
*  No, it ain't, man. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1416.56s)]
*  Like I still, it's beautiful. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1417.4s)]
*  That's why I didn't want to do this shit [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1418.52s)]
*  because I knew you were going to bring this shit up. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1419.8s)]
*  Good. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1421.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't even want to talk about this shit. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1422.16s)]
*  No, you guys, well, you don't have to do anything, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1423.0s)]
*  but to me, it's really beautiful [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1424.72s)]
*  to see you have these emotions about him. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1426.44s)]
*  Ask why you don't want to talk about it? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1427.28s)]
*  Nah, it's just, it's just, it's hard, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  it's hard to explain it all through because you still, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1432.24s)]
*  it ain't the accident, I overcame the accident. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1435.32s)]
*  I'm still recovering from Clay. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1438.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1440.24s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1441.08s)]
*  So, so all that shit happened, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1441.92s)]
*  but the day he was the first person at the hospital [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1443.76s)]
*  and he was the last person that got them [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1446.84s)]
*  when the shit happened. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1449.6399999999999s)]
*  So, the nigga was a real nigga. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1450.6399999999999s)]
*  He's a man. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1453.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think people who maybe are unfamiliar with Clay, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1454.68s)]
*  he's like an absolute icon in the music business [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1457.04s)]
*  and like a real standup dude and to the point where [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1459.28s)]
*  there was a lot of situations that you could probably speak [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1462.48s)]
*  to like the music business. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1464.32s)]
*  I think you were his first comedy client, right? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1465.8s)]
*  Yeah, that nigga ain't no shit about comedy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1467.6s)]
*  He never knew about it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1469.3999999999999s)]
*  But he knew about standing on business. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1470.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1472.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, like for example, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1473.28s)]
*  like nobody was gonna short you. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1474.28s)]
*  Nobody was gonna short any artist of Clay's [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1475.84s)]
*  and he would really stand up for them. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1478.08s)]
*  But he even wasn't that, he was just a genuine person. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1478.9199999999998s)]
*  Like even when I fuck with you, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  I fuck with you because he's a genuine person. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1482.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1483.96s)]
*  He just, it is hard to find genuine people. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1484.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1487.2s)]
*  And that's why I hold that more than anything. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1488.36s)]
*  People being genuine, because I can find talent. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1491.0s)]
*  I got talent. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1493.36s)]
*  I don't need nobody to have talent. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1494.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't need nobody to do shit, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1495.96s)]
*  especially with technology. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1497.04s)]
*  I could do everything. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1498.04s)]
*  You see me first, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1499.3999999999999s)]
*  I was the first nigga with a drone in Times Square. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1500.24s)]
*  I got footage of Times Square that nobody got. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1502.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1505.24s)]
*  So I could do everything myself. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1506.08s)]
*  Technology, I could do everything myself. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1507.84s)]
*  It's just finding people, genuine people. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1510.1599999999999s)]
*  I hold on to them. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1513.2s)]
*  And he was one of them. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1515.04s)]
*  So what else do we wanna talk about? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1518.6799999999998s)]
*  We talk about everything, bro. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1520.0s)]
*  I'm curious about the recovery. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1521.36s)]
*  You go to the hospital, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1522.96s)]
*  and how long does it take for you to get on your feet? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1523.8s)]
*  Shit. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1526.56s)]
*  To get back walking? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1527.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1528.96s)]
*  About six months. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1530.68s)]
*  How long it was? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1531.64s)]

*  When I was down there and I checked in on you, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1533.76s)]
*  I'm down in that lane, I'm doing a movie. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1538.32s)]
*  Oh, we went to Magic City. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1540.44s)]

*  I was like, do you wanna go get some food [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1550.92s)]
*  or something like that? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1552.0s)]
*  And then you said, nah, let's go to Magic City. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1553.04s)]
*  And I was like, why? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1555.52s)]
*  And you're like, what'd you say? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1556.36s)]
*  You're like, it's safer. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1557.52s)]
*  It was something about you parking your car at a restaurant. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1560.6s)]
*  You were worried that some people might recognize your car, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1563.56s)]
*  and then they'll try to follow you. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1567.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's just one. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1569.04s)]
*  This is when they were jacking cars like crazy. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1569.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1572.12s)]
*  They be stealing cars in Atlanta a lot. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1572.96s)]
*  So you just gotta pay attention and know where you're going [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1575.16s)]
*  in Atlanta or whatever. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1577.68s)]
*  But yeah, I took her to the Magic City [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1578.96s)]
*  and shit like that there. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1581.8000000000002s)]
*  Cause that's some fire. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1583.3600000000001s)]
*  And Clay was there too. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1584.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1585.28s)]
*  It's like I said, Clay's always been there for a nigga. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1588.04s)]
*  I mean that was great. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1589.28s)]
*  That was right after the accident or? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1590.1200000000001s)]
*  No, that was a few months. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1591.2s)]
*  It was about four, five months afterwards. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1592.4s)]
*  But I was in my wheelchair, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1595.04s)]
*  and that's why I put respect on people who are handicapped. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1597.48s)]
*  Cause the world don't give a fuck about handicapped people. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1600.3600000000001s)]
*  Anybody you see out there in that goddamn wheelchair, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  they did a lot just to get up. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1605.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1607.48s)]
*  And you learned that when you were in that goddamn chair. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1608.48s)]
*  But that's, see that's another thing, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1610.6799999999998s)]
*  like perspective with you. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1612.04s)]
*  I think a lot of people look at that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1613.6s)]
*  and they be angry that they were in a wheelchair. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1614.96s)]
*  No, I wouldn't. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1617.28s)]
*  And then you look at it and you're just like, man. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1618.12s)]
*  Cause I knew I was getting up. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1620.08s)]
*  They ain't never getting up. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1621.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1622.6799999999998s)]
*  Like I knew, like I said. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1623.52s)]
*  At what point did you decide, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1625.36s)]
*  I'm recovering from this shit? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1626.52s)]
*  When I was laying on that ground waiting for about four [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1627.72s)]
*  hours, couple hours waiting. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1629.6799999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1631.08s)]

*  All that shit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1634.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm never gonna walk again. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1635.48s)]
*  It don't take long for you. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1636.32s)]
*  I'm gonna walk again. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1637.1599999999999s)]

*  It wasn't nobody's celebrities like that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1877.48s)]
*  Not even celebrity, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1879.32s)]
*  but like what was the most surprising thing? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1880.32s)]
*  Shit, the love I got back from the industry people. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1885.28s)]
*  Cause like I said, you know me, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1888.12s)]
*  I don't, as much as people think like industry, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1889.32s)]
*  like hanging with celebs, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1892.56s)]
*  I've never been that guy like that. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1894.12s)]
*  I never gave a fuck about hanging with celebrities. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1895.56s)]
*  But the celebrities that hit me up, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1897.8799999999999s)]
*  I was more surprised about [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1902.96s)]
*  and just the love I got from outside of people [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1904.52s)]
*  that I didn't think that knew me. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1907.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1909.8799999999999s)]
*  So shit like that. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1910.72s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1912.12s)]
*  Like it's more a community thing. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1912.96s)]
*  Like it wasn't like a. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1913.8s)]
*  You know what it is sometimes? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1915.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like when somebody's going through something difficult, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1916.52s)]
*  you feel more comfortable showing them love [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1919.8s)]
*  than when they're thriving. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1922.56s)]
*  Because when they're thriving, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1923.56s)]
*  when you show them love, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1924.64s)]
*  some people feel like they're just glazing you. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1925.48s)]
*  Or like they're just trying to kiss your ass. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1927.8000000000002s)]
*  But when you're struggling, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1929.72s)]
*  it's almost like the excuse to pour in. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1930.5600000000002s)]
*  To pour in. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1933.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe so, I guess so. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1934.88s)]
*  Which is like, even like when you have a kid, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1936.16s)]
*  it's so easy for people to reach out and congratulate you [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1938.2800000000002s)]
*  and just give you so much love. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1940.8400000000001s)]
*  I felt that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1941.88s)]
*  And yeah, it's just an awesome. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1942.88s)]
*  And then later on down the line, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1945.5600000000002s)]
*  like when you call me, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1946.8400000000001s)]
*  it's like, man, this shit is a lot. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1947.68s)]
*  Bro, yo. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1949.3600000000001s)]

*  But like I told him, like that was the. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1962.48s)]
*  You stayed home during the day with the baby. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1964.48s)]
*  Yeah, like when my baby mama came home, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1965.9599999999998s)]

*  Like that's what the bond I get [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1978.56s)]
*  with my daughter now, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1980.28s)]
*  cause they're one to two year old time. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1981.12s)]
*  Cause like it'd be like a nurturing [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1983.2s)]
*  or like a psychological shit that goes on at that time [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1984.68s)]
*  that you bond that you can't take away from [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1988.6s)]
*  when they get older. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=1991.8799999999999s)]

*  I'm not gonna be with her like that. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2014.8s)]
*  But somehow the universe made me [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2016.36s)]
*  why I had to sit there like that for about a year. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2018.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2021.08s)]

*  Nope. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2028.0s)]
*  I never said nothing to her because like I said, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2028.84s)]
*  I felt like it was supposed to happen. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2031.4399999999998s)]
*  Like the way that shit happened [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2033.76s)]

*  So that's why I'm a Christian. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2334.32s)]
*  So I can apologize for some bullshit. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2335.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2338.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2339.52s)]
*  I fucked up. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2340.36s)]
*  You're middle ground. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2341.2000000000003s)]
*  I love that. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2342.04s)]
*  You want to stop for me. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2342.88s)]
*  Yeah, you want to know the rules there, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2344.0s)]
*  but you still want to break them. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2345.08s)]
*  Yeah, stay there. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2345.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2346.76s)]
*  I don't need them to be that. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2347.6s)]
*  No, we all supposed to be just doing what we want to do, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2348.44s)]
*  but. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2352.2000000000003s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2353.04s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2353.88s)]
*  We want to fuck around and fuck a dog. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2354.7000000000003s)]
*  That's why you can't let everybody understand that religion. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2355.54s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2359.76s)]
*  Who's fucking dog is this? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2360.6000000000004s)]
*  Understand which religion? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2361.44s)]
*  Hinduism. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2362.28s)]
*  Like it's like, do what the fuck you want to do. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2363.1200000000003s)]
*  Like it's just freedom. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2364.96s)]
*  It's like you're free, but some people freedom goes to. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2366.0800000000004s)]
*  You get karma. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2369.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2370.48s)]
*  You got to pay that. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2371.32s)]
*  Yeah, but that karma ain't enough for now. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2372.1600000000003s)]
*  That dog. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2373.2400000000002s)]
*  That karma ain't enough for now. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2374.0800000000004s)]
*  Like now in America, you say just free [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2374.92s)]
*  and just do what you want to do. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2378.2000000000003s)]
*  We'll do it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  You'll do it. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2380.56s)]
*  So it's, it don't work here. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2381.38s)]
*  So you need Islam to be like no dog fucking. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2383.0s)]
*  Yeah, like calm your ass down. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2385.0s)]
*  Stay in these rules and you'll never. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2386.6000000000004s)]
*  And see, I already have my own rules in my hands. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2388.7599999999998s)]
*  So a lot of stuff I don't, I don't. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2390.6s)]
*  You're fucked up. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2392.7599999999998s)]
*  Where do you get rules? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2393.6s)]
*  Where do you get the rules? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2394.52s)]
*  Self-discipline. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2395.72s)]
*  But how do you decide what is moral? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2396.7599999999998s)]
*  What is ethical? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2399.64s)]
*  Shit, you put some in your, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2400.8799999999997s)]
*  you put people in your life that's going, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2402.0s)]
*  like people like Clay, he was the person. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2404.12s)]
*  Like even though like I do what I want to do, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2405.8799999999997s)]
*  but sometimes when he used to tell me shit, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2408.72s)]
*  even if I didn't agree with it, I just do it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause it just gave me structure. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2414.12s)]
*  Dude, it's so funny. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2416.16s)]
*  I always say this about my dad. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2417.6s)]
*  Like what would my dad do in this situation? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2419.6s)]
*  And I feel like a lot of people have that with religion. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2420.72s)]
*  They're just like, okay, what would Jesus do? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2422.8399999999997s)]
*  Literally, what would Jesus do in this situation? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2424.44s)]
*  Cause he's the embodiment of the best decision [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2426.4s)]
*  to make in that moment. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2428.64s)]
*  But if you don't have that, I can see how anxious [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2430.6s)]
*  you must be because you never know [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2433.16s)]
*  what the right thing to do is. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2434.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we all can, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2436.3599999999997s)]
*  we all can get fucked up with some shit, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2438.0s)]
*  but like I say, I always, I'm a forward thinker. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  So if you're a forward thinker, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2442.24s)]
*  you always thinking about what if, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2443.3599999999997s)]
*  what if I'm in this position? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2445.96s)]
*  I ain't trying to go in that position. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2447.6s)]
*  That's why I've never chased being a billionaire [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2449.28s)]
*  because I've seen people in that position [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2451.92s)]
*  and there's nothing appealing to me about it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2455.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2457.08s)]
*  You're almost a prisoner of it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2458.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I don't care enough [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2459.76s)]
*  about that type of shit like that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2461.68s)]
*  I don't care about the money. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2463.12s)]
*  I don't care about all, I can make a difference. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2464.16s)]
*  And I've seen, I've proven, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2466.12s)]
*  I can make a difference being on this level. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2467.64s)]
*  Make a more impact than them motherfuckers doing. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2469.96s)]
*  You're actually more relatable on this level, probably. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2471.8s)]
*  Yeah, and don't get it twisted [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2473.88s)]
*  because that part, it's all part of the ecosystem. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2475.48s)]
*  You need that motherfucker up there too. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2478.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2480.0s)]
*  Because they make changes in the world too. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2480.84s)]
*  But you still need somebody right here [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2483.36s)]
*  to make a change too. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2484.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2486.2400000000002s)]
*  So it all works in the work of the ecosystem. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2487.08s)]
*  Is there something? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2490.08s)]
*  Do you ever get upset or angry? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2490.92s)]
*  And if you do, how do you deal with it? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2493.04s)]
*  It seems like you never get upset. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2494.56s)]
*  I get angry about five minutes or some shit, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2495.4s)]
*  but there ain't no real anger. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2497.32s)]
*  It's really nothing to be angry about. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2499.32s)]
*  I haven't seen everything, I've done everything. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2500.76s)]
*  I ain't got fucked up, damn it, dad. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2502.68s)]
*  Couple times. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2505.12s)]
*  Like this is the second time I got hit by a car. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2505.96s)]
*  Y'all ain't know it? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2507.7999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2508.64s)]
*  That's how this happened. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2509.48s)]
*  I just let people think this, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2510.3199999999997s)]
*  but this shit been like this since I was a Jit. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2512.96s)]
*  Since I got, well not a Jit, about 20 something, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2515.16s)]
*  I got hit by a car in Atlanta. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2516.96s)]
*  And dragged under it, right? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2518.2799999999997s)]
*  No, I got hit crossing the street, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2519.52s)]
*  and a motherfucker hit me. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2522.36s)]
*  Well what happened? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2523.88s)]
*  It wasn't as bad as this one. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2524.72s)]
*  How'd it hit you? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2525.72s)]
*  Just crossing the street, just hit me and I flew again. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2526.88s)]
*  Like I'm a little motherfucker, so who's gonna fly? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2529.7599999999998s)]
*  So I flew again. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2531.9199999999996s)]
*  And then shit. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2534.16s)]
*  That time too, people don't think I'm bullshitting, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2536.3599999999997s)]
*  but that time too, when I was laying out there [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2538.64s)]
*  and blood was coming all down my face, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2542.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about that shit was pouring down [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2545.16s)]
*  out of this shit. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2546.56s)]
*  And somebody, I don't know who it was, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2547.72s)]
*  some lady walked up and touched my head, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2549.12s)]
*  and that shit stopped. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2550.68s)]
*  I swear. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2552.72s)]
*  Come on, Steve. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2554.3199999999997s)]
*  I promise you, man, like even with this surgeries, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2555.16s)]
*  nigga, I had to have surgery here and here, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2557.72s)]
*  three surgeries. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2560.48s)]
*  And they told me, they saw blood. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2562.36s)]
*  On your brain. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2564.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2565.04s)]
*  They told me that. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2565.88s)]
*  And it was like, we're gonna probably have to have surgery [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2566.72s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2569.36s)]
*  And that night I prayed like a motherfucker. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2570.32s)]
*  To whom? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2572.56s)]
*  God. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=2573.4s)]

*  Every time I've almost died, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3161.64s)]
*  I almost died when I got hit by a car the first time. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3163.48s)]

*  because now it's become pretty popular tourist attraction. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3175.6800000000003s)]

*  and you jump through a hole and come out that way. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3192.48s)]
*  This is why black people don't screw with us. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3194.6800000000003s)]

*  That's it right there. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3209.4799999999996s)]
*  Okay, so- [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3211.2s)]

*  Yeah, I went the wrong way. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3216.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I've done it twice. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3217.12s)]
*  The first time, that's why I thought I could do it. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3218.4399999999996s)]
*  The second time was when I almost died. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3220.16s)]
*  Son, that's crazy. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3222.16s)]
*  So what happens is- [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3223.56s)]
*  You go through there and you slide through it [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3225.04s)]
*  and then you come out the other way. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3226.8799999999997s)]
*  But he jumped in- [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3228.3199999999997s)]
*  I jumped in and this was the first time I did it, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3229.56s)]
*  I didn't smoke. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3232.72s)]
*  You know, I wasn't smoking before then. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3233.56s)]
*  The second time I did it, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3236.08s)]
*  I went to Jamaica hiding, motherfucker smoking. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3237.12s)]
*  And I'm with my girl at that time. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3239.92s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I'm gonna do it now. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3241.6s)]
*  I'm trying to show her I can do this shit [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3243.36s)]
*  because she'd never seen me do it. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3245.4s)]
*  That's it right there. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3246.64s)]
*  You go down, I went down and I think I made a right [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3247.68s)]

*  You got lost. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3252.84s)]
*  You made a wrong turn in that one. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3253.68s)]
*  The fact that there's even a wrong way. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3256.64s)]
*  This is how I knew I was high. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3259.2s)]
*  I was under that bitch with my eyes closed [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3260.64s)]
*  trying to navigate through that shit. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3263.7599999999998s)]
*  Fuck with my head. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3265.4s)]

*  But then once I realized I had my eye, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3272.72s)]
*  I opened my eyes up and I swam back up. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3274.36s)]
*  And that's how I got out of that month. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3276.88s)]
*  And the crazy part, when I came up, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3278.68s)]

*  I'm like, I'm gonna die either way. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3411.96s)]
*  But either I'm gonna die up here where they gonna find me. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3413.9s)]

*  And I just got up and I was like, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3428.36s)]
*  hey, I came up too soon, I'm about to die. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3430.0s)]
*  And an old white man, an Asian white man came and swim [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3432.66s)]
*  and got my ass and swim and threw me on that goddamn boat [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3437.66s)]
*  like a fish. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3440.76s)]
*  And I just lay on the fish and he saved my life. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3441.6s)]
*  Wait, was that the boat you were with [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3444.32s)]

*  it's like, that's why they tell, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3453.36s)]
*  if you fly, you can't fly for 24 hours. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3455.0s)]

*  that you can't fly for 24 hours [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3460.44s)]

*  But I guess I didn't catch it. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3463.2s)]
*  Maybe I wasn't down no longer than I thought I was, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3465.36s)]
*  but you still want to do that safety check. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3467.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3469.68s)]

*  This is terrifying. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3478.7599999999998s)]

*  but all right, but me and my old lady, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3486.6s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit, let's go out there to my island. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3488.48s)]
*  I got a little small island out there. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3491.04s)]
*  I'm like, let's go out there [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3492.36s)]
*  and see if something's out there. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3493.2s)]
*  So I go out there with nothing out there, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3495.0s)]
*  cut the engine off, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3497.52s)]
*  tried to cut it on. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  That bitch didn't come home. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3502.24s)]
*  So I'm just trying again, boom, boom. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3504.8199999999997s)]
*  I ain't tripping. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3507.16s)]
*  I'm like, all right, boom, boom, boom. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3508.0s)]

*  And I'm like, oh shit, she start getting nervous. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3511.0s)]
*  I tried again, that shit was, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3513.6s)]
*  five minutes later, the island was this small. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3515.56s)]

*  Because the tide start to rise. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3522.2799999999997s)]
*  And when he says island, it's like a mound of sand. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3523.72s)]
*  It's part of your body. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3526.88s)]
*  No, it's not a mound. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3527.72s)]
*  No, no, this is a rock. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3528.56s)]
*  There was shit right in front of my house. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3529.4s)]

*  It's just a big rock and it's coral around it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3531.88s)]
*  That's why I go scuba diving and see all the fish [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3534.18s)]
*  and you can, what y'all do when y'all on scuba dive? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3536.2799999999997s)]

*  and the shit was this small and it was getting dark. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3552.84s)]
*  That ocean ain't nothing to be fucked up with. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3555.96s)]

*  Now you get it. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3725.88s)]
*  I see why y'all. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3726.7200000000003s)]

*  Like that's the only thing, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3741.36s)]
*  that's the reason why I probably still do stand up [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3742.6s)]
*  because it's the only thing that I still have to work at. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3745.4s)]
*  Everything else, life is so simple to me. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3748.8399999999997s)]

*  Keep thinking about it. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3755.56s)]
*  So maybe that's why. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3757.2799999999997s)]
*  What's the most important thing somebody could do [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3758.48s)]
*  for like a happy life? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3760.4s)]
*  Like you're talking to somebody, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3761.36s)]
*  might not have a ton of money, might have a ton of money, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3762.68s)]
*  who knows? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3764.52s)]
*  What would you tell them? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3765.36s)]
*  This is what you do. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3766.18s)]
*  Understanding. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3767.02s)]
*  That's the key to all this shit. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3767.86s)]
*  Having understanding and trying to find understanding. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3769.04s)]
*  That's what. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3772.7999999999997s)]
*  Because once you have understanding of certain shit, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3774.7999999999997s)]
*  certain shit, a lot of shit you don't stress off. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3777.68s)]
*  A lot of stuff. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3780.68s)]
*  You know what the fight and what not the fight [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3781.68s)]
*  and what's matters. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3783.68s)]
*  Because sometimes you'll fuck around and learn some shit [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3785.2799999999997s)]
*  and then as soon as you learn you're like, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3788.16s)]
*  oh shit, I hate all them people now. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3789.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3791.56s)]
*  Because you don't have no understanding [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3792.72s)]
*  because you've been. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3793.96s)]
*  Like say if you find out the Bible says, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3794.7999999999997s)]
*  Noah spread the Red Sea. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3798.88s)]
*  Now I scuba dived in. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3803.52s)]
*  Moses. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3804.36s)]
*  Who was it? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3805.18s)]
*  Moses spread the Red Sea. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3806.02s)]
*  So I scuba dived in the Red Sea. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3808.24s)]
*  And I'm looking at it like there's no fucking way. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3809.88s)]
*  You know, like this shit's like the Grand Canyon [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3812.04s)]
*  under this motherfucker. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3813.7599999999998s)]
*  But some people look at it like, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3815.2s)]
*  oh that's fucked up, fuck Christianity, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3817.12s)]
*  woot woot woot woot woot. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3818.64s)]
*  Where I don't look at it like that. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3820.04s)]
*  It's just a story that's give you understanding [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3821.36s)]
*  to make you see shit. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3823.2s)]
*  But if you don't have no understanding of that, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3824.36s)]
*  you would take that and say fuck all the Bible, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3827.0s)]
*  fuck everything. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3829.48s)]
*  And so you miss out all the stories and lessons [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3830.52s)]
*  that you could learn just because you heard [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3833.08s)]
*  that shit the wrong way. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3835.84s)]
*  So understand. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3836.68s)]
*  So don't immediately write things off. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3837.52s)]
*  Yeah, just have understanding. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3838.88s)]
*  Instead of feeling like oh I've been lied to, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3840.72s)]
*  you think oh what's true about this? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3841.92s)]
*  Yeah like why? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3843.16s)]
*  So just understanding, that's what. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3845.32s)]
*  And as a kid you would do this? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3847.44s)]
*  With everything, maybe not to this level, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3849.28s)]
*  but whatever level I was. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3851.2400000000002s)]
*  What's your life like as a kid? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3852.96s)]
*  Like you're 10 years old. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3854.16s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3855.8s)]
*  You're in Jacksonville? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3856.64s)]
*  I've always been popular. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3857.46s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3858.92s)]
*  I've always been, and you know what's so funny? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3860.1600000000003s)]
*  I just realized, in my mind I've always thought [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3862.32s)]
*  I was a star, but I just realized why. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3866.28s)]
*  Because when I was a kid, my mama had me [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3868.88s)]
*  in this thing called United Way. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3871.5200000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, the NFL did it, the United Way. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3875.48s)]
*  United Way, it's like Feed the Children type shit. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3877.5200000000004s)]
*  I was the kid on there. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3879.7200000000003s)]
*  I was the kid that they, I was the Feed the Children kid. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3882.5600000000004s)]
*  But in my mind, I guess where it really, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3885.1600000000003s)]
*  everybody knew me. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3887.6800000000003s)]
*  So you're a star. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3888.84s)]
*  In my mind I'm the star. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3889.84s)]
*  But I didn't realize I was the Feed the Children. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3891.1600000000003s)]
*  He's not a star, he's star. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3893.4s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3896.4s)]
*  What an amazing perspective. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3898.4s)]
*  So I'm glad I didn't realize until later on, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  I just put two and two together, like a couple years. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3903.6000000000004s)]

*  Yeah, like Feed the Children kid. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3930.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you know what I'm saying? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3931.7200000000003s)]
*  So from that, but programming wise, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3932.56s)]
*  subconsciously, by me thinking I'm a star, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3936.28s)]
*  I guess that plugged me into acting like a star. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3938.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3942.4s)]
*  And then I learned early on, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3944.04s)]
*  like when I'm in the hood, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3945.6s)]
*  I'm looking around my hood and I'm like, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3946.8799999999997s)]
*  I ain't supposed to be here. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3948.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I don't. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3950.04s)]
*  Was there a moment where you, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3950.8799999999997s)]
*  That's where the reincarnation come in. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3953.52s)]
*  Because like right then it was like, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3955.16s)]
*  Oh no, that's not for me. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3957.72s)]
*  This, it ain't for me. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3958.72s)]
*  It's like, this don't look like, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3960.2s)]
*  I don't look like I'm supposed to be in this environment. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3962.7599999999998s)]
*  And so right then it was like, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3965.72s)]
*  What was the moment that that? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3966.9199999999996s)]
*  Just looking around, just like, I'm like, what the fuck? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3968.24s)]
*  And why, why'd you feel like? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3970.68s)]
*  I don't know, like right. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3972.4s)]
*  I don't know, because like, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3973.52s)]
*  when I made that perspective of my mind, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3975.36s)]
*  I was like, I'm here to help these motherfuckers. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3977.76s)]
*  How old are you at this time? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3980.36s)]
*  Were you having this? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3982.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know, maybe a kid. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3983.0s)]
*  I couldn't, I be lying. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3983.84s)]
*  10, 12, 13? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3984.6800000000003s)]
*  To sound good for this camera, yeah, 10. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3986.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay, gotcha. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3987.84s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3988.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3989.52s)]
*  But it was some type of moment and I was like, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3990.36s)]
*  I'm here to help all of these people around here. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3992.76s)]
*  Well. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3994.64s)]
*  So then that program stuck in my brain to trigger. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=3995.48s)]
*  You didn't care about the reward system [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4000.64s)]
*  of the neighborhood? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4002.0s)]
*  Like, if there was like a guy, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4003.16s)]
*  like a drug dealer that had money, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4005.36s)]
*  you didn't think, oh, I could do that. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4006.36s)]
*  I've always was protected. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4007.64s)]
*  Like the village really raised me. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4008.76s)]
*  Like I've always, like I'm one, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4010.44s)]
*  you know how they say, like, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4011.76s)]
*  you can always die in the hood and shit. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4013.56s)]
*  Like, I've never been like that [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4015.36s)]
*  because I've always been protected by the hood. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4016.92s)]
*  Like they've all, like it goes back on [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4019.4s)]
*  being United Way nigga. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4021.0s)]
*  Maybe that's, the village always protected me. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4023.0s)]
*  Like if I've never had to, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4026.56s)]
*  like somebody like he might walk in there [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4030.0s)]
*  and they like, they poke their chest out. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4031.44s)]
*  I never had to poke my chest out. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4034.32s)]
*  Like I could talk shit. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4035.64s)]
*  I didn't start offending people to Twitter [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4036.84s)]
*  because they couldn't see me. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4040.36s)]
*  So before then I'm not afraid. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4042.0s)]
*  I can walk in a room and talk shit. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4043.88s)]
*  This nigga just killed six niggas. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4045.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4047.52s)]
*  I'm talking shit. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4048.56s)]
*  And in my mind, I don't realize that [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4049.52s)]
*  I shouldn't be talking to him like this. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4051.8s)]
*  But he's okay with it. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4053.7200000000003s)]
*  He's okay with it. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4054.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4055.96s)]
*  So I've always been, they've always protected me. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4056.8s)]
*  And so I've always been that type of person. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4059.2400000000002s)]
*  So it worked in my favor. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4061.7999999999997s)]
*  I think what Marcus also asked, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4064.3199999999997s)]
*  and we hear these things, I grew up in the suburbs. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4065.48s)]
*  You hear rappers be like the only way [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4067.24s)]
*  you thought you could make it out of the hood [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4069.04s)]
*  was selling drugs or playing ball or rapping. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4070.48s)]
*  Which was true. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4073.24s)]
*  And you value that reward system. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4074.24s)]
*  But did you feel like I need to do these things [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4075.72s)]
*  to get out of here or did you- [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4077.92s)]
*  I tried everything. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4078.7599999999998s)]
*  I tried everything. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4080.48s)]
*  When you're in the hood, I tried to play basketball. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4081.3199999999997s)]
*  Got cut, that was too little. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4083.2799999999997s)]
*  I tried everything. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4085.04s)]
*  I tried the band. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4086.12s)]
*  I tried football, got hit. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4086.96s)]
*  Then I joined the band. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4088.68s)]
*  But what I was great at, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4091.96s)]
*  this one I knew this was what I was supposed to do. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4094.4s)]
*  We had pep rallies in school [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4096.4s)]
*  and I used to be the dancing nigga. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4098.5199999999995s)]
*  And I went out there and I started, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4099.92s)]
*  and when I heard that crowd reaction, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4101.5199999999995s)]
*  I was like, that was my drug. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4104.36s)]
*  That's my, ain't no high bigger than that to me. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4105.76s)]
*  Even that morphine, that's second close. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4109.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's not like that. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4112.64s)]
*  To me, when I get that crowd reaction, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4114.76s)]
*  it's like the world is hugging me. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4117.8s)]
*  That feel like a God hug to me. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4119.4s)]
*  You were dick throwing back in the day. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4121.84s)]

*  But I was more of the Daytona era. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4196.68s)]
*  Daytona was 10 times. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4199.8s)]
*  Like Spring Break? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4201.0s)]
*  Spring Break. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4201.84s)]
*  Was it crazy? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4202.68s)]
*  It was called Black College Weekend, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4203.52s)]
*  but it was no college kids there. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4205.160000000001s)]
*  Niggas and street motherfuckers. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4208.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4210.2s)]
*  I never heard of it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4211.04s)]
*  You wouldn't have. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4212.84s)]
*  I grew up in New York. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4214.08s)]
*  What was the best HBCU in Florida? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4216.2s)]
*  FAMU, if you ask me. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4219.72s)]
*  But I'm biased because I'm a FAMU guy [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4221.8s)]
*  and I'm from North Florida. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4224.639999999999s)]
*  I fuck with BCU now they changed their name, BCU. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4227.0s)]
*  Why was Daytona Black College Weekend so crazy? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4230.88s)]
*  You trying to get me to talk. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4235.68s)]
*  Yes we are. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4238.04s)]
*  Yes we are. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4238.88s)]
*  Nope. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4239.72s)]
*  Actually, that's the point of this whole thing. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4240.56s)]
*  For you to talk. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4243.360000000001s)]
*  We've been talking for hours. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4244.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4246.04s)]
*  We had a good time, man. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4247.88s)]
*  Yeah, I hate this guy. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4248.96s)]
*  I have to go pee since you're not saying anything. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4250.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4253.04s)]
*  Yeah, we had a good time. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4255.88s)]
*  Okay, so young age. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4257.320000000001s)]
*  Real quick. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4259.12s)]
*  So young age, so you start to recognize [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4259.96s)]
*  that you want to help these people. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4262.12s)]
*  You're probably seeing something in the neighborhood. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4264.2s)]
*  You're seeing something in yourself. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4267.96s)]
*  There's a little bit of a difference. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4269.6s)]
*  But I see that I'm a reflection of everything around here [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4271.04s)]
*  and I got the, God gave me the way [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4274.2s)]
*  to articulate to people like you. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4277.92s)]
*  So but also to people like them. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4280.04s)]
*  I think that you speak to everybody. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4283.36s)]
*  I know, I'm every nigga, it's all in me. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4284.68s)]
*  Yeah, well did you just call me? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4287.16s)]
*  We all in. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4289.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4290.72s)]
*  He's all in me. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4291.5599999999995s)]
*  He wanted to sing that one. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4293.679999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm a man and I prove that by, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4295.04s)]
*  I'm not one of the people that like to tell, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4299.28s)]
*  hey man, I get, I don't understand, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4301.84s)]
*  I just show you and you see it. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4303.5199999999995s)]
*  Social media helps that too [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4305.24s)]
*  because I don't have to say it, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4306.5599999999995s)]
*  you'll see it in me. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4307.96s)]
*  Like you relate to something I'm doing. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4308.8s)]
*  Exactly, you have like a Larry David quality, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4310.72s)]
*  you know Larry David, right? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4312.599999999999s)]
*  Like you know how everybody relates to his frustration. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4313.8s)]
*  Because it's all of our frustrations, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4316.76s)]
*  the human frustration. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4318.24s)]
*  It's not a Jewish thing, an old white guy thing, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4319.24s)]
*  it's just everybody. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4321.32s)]
*  And I feel like you, when you communicate, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4322.36s)]
*  it works in the same way. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4324.5599999999995s)]
*  And I don't say, like I do talk to y'all, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4325.4s)]
*  but I don't say this is for black people, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4327.4s)]
*  this is Dutch and such. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4329.84s)]
*  I just show it, you know what I'm saying? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4331.2s)]
*  I don't have to say I'm for black. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4332.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't have to say this is black owned. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4334.599999999999s)]
*  Like if I got rich broke. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4336.4s)]
*  Yeah, your protest is different. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4337.24s)]
*  Yeah, if I have to tell you I'm black, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4338.48s)]
*  this black owned, you know what I'm saying? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4341.12s)]
*  Like and we don't realize, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4343.4s)]
*  and I learned this through Chris at MTV2. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4344.599999999999s)]
*  Just like sometimes when you put a label on it, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4348.56s)]
*  you block all this. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4351.12s)]
*  You alienate people. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4352.2s)]
*  You alienate, so like if a club say hip hop, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4353.04s)]
*  if you ain't in hip hop, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4355.96s)]
*  you're not gonna go in there. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4357.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4358.84s)]
*  But if it just say club, you will try it out, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4359.8s)]
*  and you never know you might like it. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4362.84s)]
*  So that's how I treat everything. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4364.84s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4366.24s)]
*  I don't, even on my social media, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4367.08s)]
*  I try not to, unless it's something like it's a joke [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4368.4800000000005s)]
*  that works good if I just say it. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4370.64s)]
*  But for the most part, I try to keep it to where [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4372.96s)]
*  it's just me, and then whoever draw to it, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4375.16s)]
*  that's who come to it. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4379.24s)]
*  Like I don't, I didn't say I wanna be, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4380.08s)]
*  I wanna get in the white world. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4382.32s)]
*  So here's what I'm saying, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4383.96s)]
*  like most people in my industry, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4384.8s)]
*  they like, they try to get in the white world [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4386.92s)]
*  and such and such. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4389.04s)]
*  I've never wanted to do that. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4389.88s)]
*  I've always been cool with it. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4391.36s)]
*  If the worst case scenario, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4392.76s)]
*  all I gotta do is entertain my people. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4393.599999999999s)]
*  I was cool with it. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4396.5199999999995s)]
*  But I also understood too, we all the same. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4397.76s)]
*  We all the same, and I learned that through, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4401.24s)]
*  and I proved that through Buckwild, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4403.68s)]
*  we did that show with the guy from Buckwild. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4405.72s)]
*  I was like, this redneck is a nigga. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4409.360000000001s)]
*  Niggas and rednecks is pretty much damn near the same. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4411.72s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4414.84s)]
*  And we showed that through shit like that. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4415.68s)]
*  So I've always took that in everything and applied it. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4418.12s)]
*  But I think a lot of times with people, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4421.0s)]
*  when they feel that sensation you felt, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4422.76s)]
*  which is like, I shouldn't be doing this, right? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4424.88s)]
*  A lot of times there often is like a resentment [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4428.280000000001s)]
*  for the community, right? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4430.72s)]
*  And this happens with, it could be a poor white dude [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4432.44s)]
*  who feels like he's smarter than his community, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4435.24s)]
*  and he's like, I need to get out of here, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4437.2s)]
*  and I need to hang out with these smart people. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4438.4s)]
*  No, I'm not that guy. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4440.04s)]
*  I know you're not. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4440.96s)]
*  I hate people like that too. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4441.799999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4442.62s)]
*  I hate when my people, they get in and they shit on me. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4443.46s)]
*  And they shit on, yeah, yeah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4446.679999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4447.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not that in there. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4448.4s)]
*  I don't, like if anybody, like, Bootsy for example. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4449.24s)]
*  If anybody should understand, Bootsy is us. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4452.839999999999s)]
*  No matter how y'all, y'all can get offended [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4455.5199999999995s)]
*  at all you want to, you say, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4457.5199999999995s)]
*  but we can't shit on our people. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4458.919999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4461.0s)]
*  I can't, because I understand this. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4461.84s)]
*  It's like that drunk uncle. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4464.2s)]
*  Like you might got a drunk uncle. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4465.16s)]
*  You know he gonna offend and such, such. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4467.04s)]
*  But you ain't mad at him. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4469.76s)]
*  So that's how I see our people. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4471.84s)]
*  So when I see other niggas condemning somebody [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4473.32s)]

*  So if you're in an accident, not calling a lawyer [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4701.3s)]
*  means you could be leaving money on the table [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4704.1s)]

*  for over 500,000 clients. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4721.58s)]
*  That doesn't mean one settlement for 199 billion [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4723.78s)]
*  and then a couple other people fighting for scraps. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4726.86s)]

*  because it was so hard for me to... [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4832.78s)]
*  Y'all was the first people to tell me to do them shit. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4834.9s)]

*  And I realized too, over time, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4843.339999999999s)]
*  that rambling can come back and eat your ass up. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4845.46s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4848.42s)]

*  if you ain't paying attention, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4852.299999999999s)]

*  You can take it out of context. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4856.58s)]
*  So I have to protect myself in certain type of ways. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4857.7s)]
*  But I don't know, just over time, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4860.66s)]
*  I think I'm gonna eventually get into it. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4865.54s)]
*  The only reason I'm doing this now, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4868.14s)]
*  that part, not yours, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4869.22s)]
*  but the part that I got coming out [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4870.18s)]
*  is because of Clay and Charlamagne. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4872.46s)]
*  Because Charlamagne, Bing gave me, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4874.9s)]
*  the network Bing gave me the deal or whatever. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4877.46s)]
*  But I just said, fuck this shit. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4880.26s)]
*  Fuck, like, bring it in. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4882.46s)]
*  But by them being my friends, they understand me. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4884.78s)]
*  So they waited out with me. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4888.18s)]
*  Then Clay convinced me to do it with him. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4890.14s)]
*  So I ended up doing it, and then he died. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4895.18s)]
*  So now I'm doing it. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4897.26s)]
*  To honor him. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4898.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4899.62s)]
*  And just because they held me down, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4900.660000000001s)]
*  Dolly and what's-his-name, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4902.58s)]
*  because they could've took the money back, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4904.5s)]
*  you know, that shit. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4906.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4907.42s)]
*  But in general, streaming seems so popular right now. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4908.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, we got off track. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4912.58s)]
*  I think streaming is like that [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4914.54s)]
*  because like I said, people ain't got that much, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4915.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, they ain't got shit to do. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4917.54s)]
*  So a lot of people ain't got shit to do, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4918.58s)]
*  so they just watch. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4921.38s)]
*  It's something to do. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4923.38s)]
*  So it's just boredom? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4924.3s)]
*  You think people are bored? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4925.14s)]
*  It's boredom, and I don't want you to watch me [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4926.26s)]
*  while you're bored. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4927.9800000000005s)]
*  That takes the mystique of power of who you are. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4929.14s)]
*  Wait a minute, explain that. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4932.7s)]
*  You don't want people to watch you while they're bored. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4933.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just like specials. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4936.06s)]
*  That's why I don't care about stand-up specials, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4936.9400000000005s)]
*  because people, it ain't special no more. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4938.46s)]
*  You watch when you're laying in the bed, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4940.38s)]
*  about to go to sleep. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4941.58s)]
*  You want people putting on an outfit, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4942.78s)]
*  going to the movie theater, making an event out of it. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4944.5s)]
*  That's what made us who we are. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4946.820000000001s)]
*  That's what made Delirious great. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4947.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what made all the specials great. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4949.22s)]
*  Even when you watch people you fight. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4950.7s)]
*  When the last time a special changed something. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4951.54s)]
*  When the last time a special really... [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4953.26s)]
*  It don't do it no more. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4955.34s)]
*  It ain't that no more. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4956.18s)]
*  They're not saying you don't do it. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4957.02s)]
*  It's like an album. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4957.860000000001s)]
*  It's like an album. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4958.9400000000005s)]
*  Album don't have the effect it used to do no more. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4959.780000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4962.1s)]
*  So once I understood that, my specials, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4962.9400000000005s)]
*  I've been putting out specials on Twitter for 15 years. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4965.74s)]
*  So, and all, because what specials did? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4968.58s)]
*  They gave us catchphrases, and gave us shit [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4970.860000000001s)]
*  that implemented the culture. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4974.7s)]
*  What I've been doing on social media. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4978.66s)]
*  So I've been doing it. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4980.58s)]
*  And it's just, we're programmed to think [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4981.46s)]
*  that's what comedy is, and that's what that shit is. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4983.5s)]
*  But it really ain't. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4985.9400000000005s)]
*  Like we programmed to think we wanna be movie stars. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4987.78s)]
*  Cause that's what we came up in. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4990.3s)]
*  That shit been done 20 years ago. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4991.66s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4993.7s)]
*  And I understood that 20 years ago. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4994.74s)]
*  That's why I never chased that side of the world. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4996.34s)]
*  Dude, it's so crazy. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4998.34s)]
*  I was looking at why you chose to get into hip hop videos. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=4999.18s)]
*  It's such an interesting thing. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5005.74s)]
*  I didn't know that this was a choice. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5007.02s)]
*  I thought you just kind of like, I don't know, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5009.54s)]

*  I understood early this shit is over with, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5015.9s)]
*  this Hollywood shit. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5019.34s)]

*  It's just money going somewhere. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5033.5s)]
*  So it's the same thing in life. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5035.78s)]
*  So I don't pay attention to what people say. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5036.78s)]
*  I just pay attention to what's going on. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5039.58s)]
*  What's moving culture. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5041.0599999999995s)]
*  Moving, or just, humans, we just talking, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5041.9s)]
*  but we really are what we are. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5045.179999999999s)]
*  So if you pay attention to the people actions, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5046.62s)]
*  and that's what you'll find out. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5048.66s)]
*  So that's what I did then. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5050.219999999999s)]
*  So I just paid, when I went out to LA [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5051.38s)]
*  and I started seeing what was going on, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5054.3s)]
*  like, oh no, this shit changing. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5056.98s)]
*  And then the internet started, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5058.66s)]
*  social media started bubbling at that time. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5059.94s)]
*  And then it wasn't, and then too, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5063.139999999999s)]
*  this was the main thing. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5065.18s)]
*  TV, it wasn't no black shows on TV no more at that time. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5066.9800000000005s)]
*  So this is what- [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5072.06s)]
*  The sitcoms was dying down. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5072.900000000001s)]
*  So after UPN9 kind of started to triple down. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5074.38s)]
*  Yeah, it started fizzling down, so you start seeing like- [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5076.66s)]
*  Where are the black people watching things? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5078.820000000001s)]
*  There's nowhere for us on this motherfucker no more. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5080.780000000001s)]
*  And then you're like, where are they? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5083.18s)]
*  Where are they? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5084.54s)]
*  They're in music videos. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5085.38s)]
*  Yeah, like, where is our culture? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5086.22s)]
*  And so I'm looking at where it's making the impact. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5089.1s)]
*  The impact was in videos. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5092.1s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5094.38s)]
*  Like, to this day, shit that's stuck in our heads [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5095.22s)]
*  is mostly shit from videos. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5097.9800000000005s)]
*  So I understood that, I was like, shit, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5099.58s)]
*  I'm right here in the middle of this shit. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5102.06s)]
*  These motherfuckers love me anyway, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5104.54s)]
*  because most of the rappers- [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5105.900000000001s)]
*  They would come to your show. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5107.74s)]
*  They come to my stand-up shows. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5108.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5109.9800000000005s)]
*  And so we already had, that's why it came. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5110.82s)]
*  And see, that's another thing too, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5112.42s)]
*  because people start trying to do what I did, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5113.38s)]
*  but they didn't say anything about stand-up. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5115.3s)]
*  It was organic, so it works for me. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5117.02s)]
*  Like, I am a hip hop comedian, so it works for me. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5119.38s)]
*  And I ain't trying to force it, because I seen it work. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5123.14s)]
*  It is me, you see what I'm saying? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5125.58s)]
*  And it was just time, that's why I say the universe, God, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5127.660000000001s)]
*  it just all worked at the perfect time. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5130.660000000001s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5133.42s)]
*  And I just rode with it. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5134.26s)]
*  I trust the universe that it's gonna work in my favor. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5135.860000000001s)]
*  So once I understood that, I understood, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5140.1s)]
*  like, I'm gonna go where people love me, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5143.26s)]
*  and I went to Atlanta, I went back to Atlanta, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5145.1s)]
*  and I got on social media, and that was another thing. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5148.1s)]
*  When I got on social media, I was like, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5151.7s)]
*  ain't nobody on this motherfucker yet. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5154.3s)]
*  And I seen this, this was the beginning, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5156.58s)]
*  I understood, like, this is the future. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5158.26s)]
*  And that's when I was like, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5161.7s)]
*  I could be my own Hollywood right here. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5163.9s)]
*  That's when I understood, this is gonna be Hollywood. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5166.66s)]
*  So I just started focusing on, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5169.3s)]
*  and then I understood, like, humans, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5171.94s)]
*  how their brains work, and their kids. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5174.58s)]
*  People was kids on social media at first. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5177.94s)]
*  I was programming people how to talk on Twitter, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5180.5s)]
*  because they didn't understand [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5183.06s)]
*  how to talk regular on Twitter. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5184.14s)]
*  It'd be little shit like that. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5186.38s)]
*  So I understood my power. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5188.26s)]
*  The only time they'd ever typed anything was like an essay. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5190.74s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't understand. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5193.3s)]
*  So they had it typed in colloquial English. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5194.14s)]
*  They didn't understand how to transfer the dialect, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5196.06s)]
*  how we talking now to social media. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5198.82s)]
*  It sounds easy now, but back then, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5201.46s)]
*  it was like people was really stupid or something. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5203.9800000000005s)]
*  You could tell a simple ass joke, and this was hilarious. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5206.74s)]
*  It was go crazy. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5210.139999999999s)]
*  It was like, these motherfuckers are kids now. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5210.98s)]
*  But the difference between me and everybody, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5213.38s)]
*  I understood, I didn't use my shit for personal gain, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5215.54s)]
*  because I could have monetized and fucked over people [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5218.94s)]
*  and manipulated the game and became everything y'all see [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5221.0599999999995s)]
*  in like World Star or all that shit there. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5223.98s)]
*  But I used it more so to say that I used everything [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5226.54s)]
*  to help our people get where we are. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5230.9s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5233.5s)]
*  So, and like people say they influenced [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5234.34s)]
*  by these other comedians, but if you watch them, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5237.82s)]
*  all of them followed my blueprint. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5240.259999999999s)]
*  For example? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5242.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm just saying as far as everything [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5243.38s)]
*  that they successful is, it's from social media, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5245.179999999999s)]
*  from them building that social media and shit. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5248.0599999999995s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5250.46s)]
*  It ain't from them being them fucking movie star. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5251.299999999999s)]
*  Who would have made it from being a movie star [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5253.78s)]
*  in the last 10, 15 years? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5255.099999999999s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5256.219999999999s)]
*  Even in the white world. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5257.139999999999s)]
*  I always. Even in the white world. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5258.0599999999995s)]
*  Who would have made it? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5259.34s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5260.179999999999s)]
*  Like they think, like I always hear them say like, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5261.0199999999995s)]
*  we don't have that much, there's not enough [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5262.7s)]
*  for the black community. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5265.78s)]
*  It ain't nothing for nobody. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5268.34s)]
*  Everybody fucked up. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5269.42s)]
*  We just take it personal, we go through it. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5270.34s)]
*  But you, I remember telling you, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5272.66s)]
*  before this shit happened, you was like, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5275.82s)]
*  man, this shit fucked up out here. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5277.86s)]
*  I'm struggling, I don't know where to go. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5279.7s)]
*  But people don't know that story. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5282.1s)]
*  They don't hear that, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5284.1s)]
*  because they just think all white people got it easy. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5285.0199999999995s)]
*  But he was like, he didn't know where to fucking go. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5287.22s)]
*  He was still trying to figure it out. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5290.0599999999995s)]
*  But look, it happened. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5291.26s)]
*  They only see the success. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5292.62s)]
*  Because of the internet. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5293.9s)]
*  Because of the internet. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5295.0199999999995s)]
*  He created his own. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5296.86s)]
*  He adopted it and he created his understanding. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5297.7s)]
*  So, and that's why I get my. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5300.82s)]
*  You would hit me, I'd have some show [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5304.9s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5306.82s)]
*  And that's another thing that's dope about you. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5307.98s)]
*  There are certain people that like, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5310.139999999999s)]
*  they'll be, they'll take somebody's influence. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5311.219999999999s)]
*  Like I took your influence, right? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5313.7s)]
*  And then when they do something special, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5315.38s)]
*  instead of feeling good about that, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5319.339999999999s)]
*  they'll be like angry or jealous. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5321.7s)]
*  And you, people will do that. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5324.0199999999995s)]
*  But you would always hit me and you'd be like, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5327.5s)]
*  damn man, you're making me cry out here in the Bahamas. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5329.62s)]
*  And somebody's like. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5332.38s)]
*  Yeah, because I love to see it. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5333.22s)]
*  That's why I do it. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5334.86s)]
*  That's where I get my satisfaction from. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5336.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was really cool. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5337.74s)]
*  It ain't the money, it ain't the success. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5338.58s)]
*  I've had so much success now, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5340.22s)]
*  ain't pretty much nothing left. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5341.58s)]
*  Everything you could think you wanna do, I did. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5343.5s)]
*  So I mean, it's just like now, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5345.86s)]
*  I get my satisfaction out of watching people that. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5347.42s)]
*  But what a great, like what a great. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5351.94s)]
*  Even if they don't give me props. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5353.82s)]
*  I just like to see it. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5355.74s)]
*  It's just like you're seeing a kid, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5357.34s)]
*  like look at this motherfucker acting like me. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5358.66s)]
*  But isn't that like a genius move? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5360.58s)]
*  Like think about that pivot, right? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5362.38s)]
*  You go, okay, where is my community? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5363.9s)]
*  Where are our eyeballs? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5367.82s)]
*  What are we watching? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5368.9s)]
*  Oh, we're not watching TV shows [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5369.86s)]
*  because ain't shit out there really for us. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5371.42s)]
*  We're watching music videos [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5374.099999999999s)]
*  and the music videos are almost our stories. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5375.5s)]
*  They're our shows. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5377.42s)]
*  I'm gonna integrate myself in this where I already exist. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5378.5s)]
*  I'm friends with all these guys [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5381.38s)]
*  and I'm going to be the thing I already am, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5382.46s)]
*  which is hip hop comedian. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5384.42s)]
*  That takes balls. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5386.02s)]
*  Most people are still trying to chase Hollywood. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5386.9s)]
*  They're still trying to tell you TV show. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5388.62s)]
*  That's what they talk. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5389.46s)]
*  That's they do what you talk. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5390.5s)]
*  Like you do what works. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5391.66s)]
*  But that's genius shit right there. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5392.5s)]
*  Sometimes, and you might not credit yourself, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5394.14s)]
*  but genius is bucking the trend. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5395.9s)]
*  Genius is doing the thing that nobody wants to do [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5397.74s)]
*  or nobody is willing to do. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5400.22s)]
*  It's sitting right there and none of us see it. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5401.06s)]
*  Even though it makes perfect sense. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5402.78s)]
*  And the confidence to do it. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5403.9800000000005s)]
*  But it just comes from being simple. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5405.46s)]
*  I understand how to make it simple. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5408.06s)]
*  However you wanna describe it. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5409.7s)]
*  What I'm saying is it's a very rare quality. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5411.1s)]
*  It's easy to be second. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5412.74s)]
*  It's easy to see someone do it and then do it after them. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5414.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's very hard to be the first person to do it. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5417.219999999999s)]
*  It's just trailblazing. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5421.7s)]
*  I mean it's just being a trailblazer [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5423.219999999999s)]
*  and then being an explorer. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5424.62s)]
*  Like I hate being in a room [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5426.219999999999s)]
*  and everybody knows something I don't. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5427.459999999999s)]
*  So I've always applied that to me. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5429.98s)]
*  So it's like if I find out there's something going on, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5431.7s)]
*  like when I got into aviation [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5434.82s)]
*  and I seen that whole world and I start putting to it, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5437.299999999999s)]
*  then I'm like this shit been going on 100 years. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5439.379999999999s)]
*  I don't know not one person that really fly for real. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5441.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5444.54s)]
*  That's what I'm here for. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5445.38s)]
*  I'm here to show these motherfuckers we can fly. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5447.06s)]
*  What about space? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5449.18s)]
*  I wanna go to space. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5450.820000000001s)]
*  That's boy, that's my girl. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5451.66s)]
*  That's the last one right? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5453.18s)]
*  That's the last one. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5454.02s)]
*  I can't wait to do the self in the world behind me. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5455.02s)]
*  Head stunt from now. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5457.02s)]
*  I'm gonna shit on the motherfuckers. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5457.860000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna go live. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5459.02s)]
*  That's when I'm gonna go live. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5459.860000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna go live on that bitch. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5461.54s)]
*  And then after that I don't know what the fuck to do. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5462.9800000000005s)]
*  Bottom of the ocean would you do that? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5464.900000000001s)]
*  I've done that. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5466.34s)]
*  But like deep submarine? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5467.18s)]
*  I got a submarine in the dark. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5468.860000000001s)]
*  I don't go in, this is the camera though. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5470.38s)]
*  But I want a submarine. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5471.820000000001s)]
*  I saw one but that shit cost too much. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5473.42s)]
*  You're not gonna get scared claustrophobic? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5475.38s)]
*  I'm claustrophobic. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5477.14s)]
*  I'd rather go to space than the bottom of the ocean. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5477.9800000000005s)]
*  I think so. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5480.1s)]
*  I'd rather go to space than the bottom of the ocean. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5480.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5481.78s)]
*  Space is space. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5482.74s)]
*  I don't know, I've been rethinking the ocean for a second. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5483.58s)]
*  I don't know, that might be a portal somewhere for real. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5487.38s)]
*  What you mean? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5491.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5492.66s)]
*  The ocean scares me so I'm probably gonna believe [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5493.5s)]
*  whatever you say. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5495.46s)]
*  The ocean is something in there. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5496.3s)]
*  It's like Aquaman the movie. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5497.14s)]
*  That comes from something for real. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5499.54s)]
*  That shit real down there, man. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5502.62s)]
*  And when you go down there, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5504.34s)]
*  scuba diving is what made me understand how dumb I was too. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5506.38s)]
*  What you mean? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5510.18s)]
*  When I first went down I realized, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5511.02s)]
*  damn this is a whole world down here. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5513.02s)]
*  Yeah, most of the world. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5514.78s)]
*  70% of the world or whatever is water [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5516.18s)]
*  and we haven't explored the majority of that 70%. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5518.26s)]
*  You see that and you realize how much you don't know. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5520.9s)]
*  You're like, oh no, I'm really dumb. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5523.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5525.74s)]
*  That's why I say we all dumb. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5526.58s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't see it. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5528.740000000001s)]
*  What does dumb mean to you? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5530.66s)]
*  Does dumb mean just there are things you don't know? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5531.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we're all dumb. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5534.66s)]
*  We're all robots but we think we smart [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5535.5s)]
*  because we put you and two together but we dumb. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5537.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5539.9800000000005s)]
*  And we prove it every day [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5540.820000000001s)]
*  because the robots are programming us. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5541.66s)]
*  So you use the word dumb as just following, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5543.860000000001s)]
*  not acknowledging there's so much more out there [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5547.5s)]
*  that you don't know. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5549.3s)]
*  I'm using like we don't control ourselves [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5550.22s)]
*  as much as we think we do. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5552.34s)]
*  We have a lack of autonomy. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5553.22s)]
*  So what's that? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5554.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5555.06s)]
*  That's dumb, man. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5555.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5556.9400000000005s)]
*  We really wake up and do whatever we program to do. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5558.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5560.82s)]
*  The difference is I understand my programming [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5561.66s)]
*  so I reprogram it before I can see it. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5563.139999999999s)]
*  I'm like, shoot, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5566.3s)]
*  All right, now I can do that move. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5567.62s)]
*  That's what self-discipline come in. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5568.9s)]
*  What do you think about AI, artificial intelligence? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5571.38s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5573.3s)]
*  Like, shit, I think AI is to connect us together [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5574.139999999999s)]
*  and we gonna be super humans. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5577.0199999999995s)]
*  We gonna be like X-Men around this bitch. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5578.7s)]
*  So you got it. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5580.3s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5581.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, best case scenario for you is [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5581.98s)]
*  the robots are best case scenario. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5583.0199999999995s)]
*  Which is gonna fix things. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5584.78s)]
*  Now it's definitely gonna, I mean, it's gonna leave. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5586.34s)]
*  It's gonna be like if you ain't got the robot [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5588.78s)]
*  or understand, it's gonna be like not knowing [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5590.78s)]
*  how to read back in the day. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5593.860000000001s)]

*  and take over humans? [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5645.58s)]
*  I think that's just where we supposed to go as humans [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5646.94s)]
*  in the long run anyway. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5649.42s)]

*  from this little ragged ass body of ours [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5659.42s)]
*  and go to there. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5662.5s)]

*  oh no, I do know what I'm talking about. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5684.62s)]
*  How much shrooms did like, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5686.62s)]
*  and it opened up like, oh shit. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5688.42s)]
*  Now it made me realize a lot of, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5690.42s)]
*  you like, oh shit, that was how they invented. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5692.98s)]
*  They was on shrooms. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5695.42s)]
*  That's how that was it. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5696.78s)]
*  They was on shrooms. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5697.82s)]
*  That you are, shrooms just opened up any ayahuasca [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5698.94s)]
*  or the other sh, what's that, MDM? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5702.86s)]
*  DMT. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5705.82s)]
*  DMT, yeah. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5706.66s)]
*  It just opens it up to understanding it. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5707.74s)]
*  But even to do them, you gotta already be kinda there. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5710.74s)]
*  You have to be willing to accept it. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5714.139999999999s)]
*  Accept it and see it for what it, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5715.42s)]
*  have a little understanding that [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5717.94s)]
*  it's bigger than who we are as humans. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5720.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's something that, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5722.38s)]
*  when we were in the Bahamas that you kept, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5723.54s)]
*  stressing is the wrong word, but kind of pointing out. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5726.7s)]
*  And it was like, when at night we looking at the stars, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5729.0199999999995s)]
*  it was this constant humbling. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5732.26s)]
*  You're just like, look how little we are. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5734.22s)]
*  Look how significant we are. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5736.66s)]
*  That's what shrooms do. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5737.860000000001s)]
*  Show, it makes, like you can't be arrogant on shrooms [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5738.9400000000005s)]
*  because you realize it takes it back to Hinduism. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5741.900000000001s)]
*  That's where it takes it back to that. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5746.1s)]
*  It's just like, oh no, this is what we supposed to be doing. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5748.66s)]
*  And I'm sitting in the grass with bugs all on me [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5751.42s)]
*  and I can't, and like this is what it is. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5754.06s)]
*  And that's when it goes back when I went traveling [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5757.54s)]
*  and shit, they would say all pieces of the puzzle [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5759.66s)]
*  and then they start coming together. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5762.78s)]
*  It's like, oh, that's what I was learning over there [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5763.62s)]
*  with that goddamn Hindu shit. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5765.66s)]
*  This is what boom, boom, boom. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5768.179999999999s)]
*  Dude, it was fun being. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5769.46s)]
*  Life is the best show ever. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5771.259999999999s)]
*  It is, if you're willing to watch it. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5772.54s)]
*  If you're willing to watch it, that's how I look at shit [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5774.379999999999s)]
*  from the outside looking in. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5776.139999999999s)]
*  But I'm just happy I'm a part of the characters. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5778.0199999999995s)]
*  But your character in it, like, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5781.099999999999s)]
*  cause watching your show is kind of funny [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5784.66s)]
*  because we would be walking, right? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5786.66s)]
*  And you're gonna be like, yeah man, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5789.0599999999995s)]
*  my old lady don't like Asian bitches or something. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5792.02s)]
*  You just say something random, right? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5795.42s)]
*  And then I'd be like, oh fuck, is that poison ivy? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5797.14s)]
*  And you'd be like, yeah, it's okay. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5800.62s)]
*  Just rub some of that leaf on it. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5802.22s)]
*  I go, why? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5803.7s)]
*  And you go, oh, nature always puts the cure [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5804.54s)]
*  to the illness right next to it. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5806.5s)]
*  And you're like, what is going on right now? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5808.26s)]
*  Do you remember telling me that shit? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5810.86s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5812.26s)]
*  But that's true though. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5813.1s)]
*  You told me that poison oak. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5813.94s)]
*  There was something like the cure was a leaf [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5815.86s)]
*  right next to the thing. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5817.98s)]
*  I mean, not America. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5820.06s)]
*  The world always gives us something. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5820.900000000001s)]
*  It gives us everything. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5822.580000000001s)]
*  We just lost it over time through technology. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5823.42s)]
*  But it's right there. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5825.9400000000005s)]
*  Like it's usually whatever the problem is, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5827.18s)]
*  the solution right next to it. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5830.54s)]
*  And that's in life too. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5831.820000000001s)]
*  Damn, that's deep. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5834.18s)]
*  I just thought about that. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5835.02s)]
*  See, like I'm saying, I'm not smart. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5837.9400000000005s)]
*  This shit just be coming out from somewhere, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5839.22s)]
*  but it ain't me. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5840.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm just happy whoever used it, me using it. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5843.5s)]
*  Do you ever feel like they were trying to silence you? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5846.1s)]
*  Because I feel like there was a time where Instagram. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5848.58s)]
*  There probably was, but when you were on that floor [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5850.7s)]
*  thinking you don't realize it afterwards, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5853.22s)]
*  and then you're like, oh shit. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5855.1s)]
*  But yeah, I mean. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5857.46s)]
*  There was a time like I was trying to follow you [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5858.3s)]
*  and then there was another page and another page. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5860.34s)]
*  You were canceled on Instagram. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5862.14s)]
*  But that was, I was just, usually when shit happen, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5863.54s)]
*  I'm usually the first one. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5865.74s)]
*  So I'm the collateral damage for everybody. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5867.14s)]
*  So even when I think I was on your show last time, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5869.06s)]
*  I was like, everything y'all see ain't happen now. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5871.26s)]
*  It's gonna happen to everybody else eventually in our culture. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5873.5s)]
*  And it's every, and for the last four years. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5875.82s)]
*  Niggas was getting deleted for just talking like niggas. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5878.58s)]
*  So this is like a really, there's important distinction here. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5881.06s)]
*  This exposed the problem with the lack of diversity. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5884.18s)]
*  There were people getting kicked off Instagram. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5888.02s)]

*  You stupid, Instagram would deem as bullying [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5901.9400000000005s)]
*  when anybody who knows black people [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5905.78s)]
*  is the highest compliment when you make a joke. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5908.099999999999s)]
*  But it was just the fact that there were no black people [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5910.62s)]
*  in there realizing that there were certain vernacular, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=5913.0199999999995s)]

*  What's stopping us from not doing it? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6173.3s)]
*  I'm not finna be Amish. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6175.34s)]
*  Amish, what is it? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6176.42s)]
*  Amish. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6177.58s)]
*  I'm not finna be that motherfucker out here. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6178.98s)]
*  And where I live in the islands, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6182.0599999999995s)]
*  that's about as Amish as I'm gonna get. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6183.34s)]
*  You know, to me, on that island, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6185.38s)]
*  it's like if I don't need it over here, I don't need it. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6188.42s)]
*  So that's why I program myself to be like, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6190.94s)]
*  just in case I don't wanna go too far left, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6194.1s)]
*  I can still deal with this shit. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6196.06s)]
*  What do you think about America, living in America, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6197.54s)]
*  the future of America? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6200.34s)]
*  I'm curious all your thoughts, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6201.18s)]
*  because I think about this a lot. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6202.34s)]
*  I think America in the beginning stages [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6203.740000000001s)]
*  of where we gonna be is who we are. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6205.9400000000005s)]
*  Everywhere we, Asia, that's pretty much what it is. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6209.06s)]
*  Whatever going on over there, that's kinda like, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6213.42s)]
*  we so, we think we are here, but we really behind. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6215.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6218.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6219.46s)]
*  I think so, as far as where, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6220.3s)]
*  with China and Russia, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6222.219999999999s)]
*  financially Russia and just socially China. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6226.66s)]
*  We move more and more. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6231.179999999999s)]
*  Think about it, they socially awkward, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6233.099999999999s)]
*  who the most socially awkward people are? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6234.82s)]
*  Oh, you're saying that we're just gonna get there. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6236.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we just- They're already there. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6238.259999999999s)]
*  They're already isolated. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6239.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they already there. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6240.86s)]
*  They already what they are. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6242.0599999999995s)]
*  They already super robots. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6243.259999999999s)]
*  You know, this is it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6244.94s)]
*  You see them viral moments when they doing this shit. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6245.78s)]
*  They already there. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6247.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6249.58s)]
*  At the beginning stages of all this shit, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6250.42s)]
*  and even in the economics or whatever, business, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6253.1s)]
*  we still at the beginning stage. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6256.54s)]
*  And do you think we're all gonna eventually [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6258.1s)]
*  become those robots? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6259.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6261.74s)]
*  And is that something you- [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6262.58s)]
*  We keep saying robots is not robots. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6263.42s)]
*  The robots is just enhancement. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6265.3s)]
*  It's like a viagra. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6268.46s)]
*  When I say robots, I don't mean robots, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6271.58s)]
*  I mean like, do you think that all the decisions [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6272.9400000000005s)]
*  will essentially be made for us [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6275.14s)]
*  and we'll just have no autonomy? [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6276.42s)]
*  Because that seems to be what you're saying right now [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6278.26s)]
*  is like you are deprogramming yourself [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6279.74s)]
*  and that you're gonna make the decisions about your life [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6282.82s)]
*  and do what you think is best [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6284.94s)]
*  instead of having these trends decide what you do. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6286.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6288.3s)]
*  That's how you're supposed to do it. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6289.139999999999s)]
*  That's how you're supposed to do it [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6289.98s)]
*  even before all that shit happen. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6290.82s)]
*  Before you get affected by the world, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6292.5s)]
*  you understand the world and build your own world [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6295.5s)]
*  like an ecosystem where none of that shit [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6299.099999999999s)]
*  is going on out there, don't even bother. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6301.0199999999995s)]
*  They do that in full at all. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6303.66s)]
*  There's so many communities, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6304.5s)]
*  like already small communities, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6306.66s)]
*  where they have their own world. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6308.98s)]
*  Bro, that's the thing about Florida where like, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6310.58s)]
*  you saw Florida, I think black people in Florida [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6313.259999999999s)]
*  were the first black people to openly support Trump. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6316.379999999999s)]
*  And to me, I'm like, oh, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6319.419999999999s)]
*  they're operating in their own community. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6320.78s)]
*  They're not worried about what the world might think [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6323.46s)]
*  of a black person supporting this guy who is called racist. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6326.66s)]
*  We just, it ain't so much like we right or wrong. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6330.66s)]
*  We just say what the fuck we wanna say. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6333.379999999999s)]
*  That's just Florida motherfuckers [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6334.82s)]
*  and we get a kick out of it. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6336.259999999999s)]
*  But now everybody gets a kick out of it. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6337.5s)]
*  Yeah, because that's another thing too. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6339.5s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6341.34s)]
*  Like the trend started there. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6342.18s)]
*  That's in America, if you wanna see the future, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6344.3s)]
*  go to the Bay or go to Florida. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6346.42s)]
*  Wait, really? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6348.22s)]
*  Yeah, the Bay gonna tell you the technology future. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6349.06s)]
*  Florida gonna show you the streets. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6351.66s)]
*  Wait, really? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6354.66s)]
*  So the street shit starts Florida always. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6355.5s)]
*  That's why I say I was in the perfect place. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6357.46s)]
*  Florida, that's why everything I am, I'm the coach. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6360.02s)]
*  I'm the coach of everything. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6363.78s)]
*  So I might have a heads up already [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6365.14s)]
*  because where I'm at, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6366.78s)]
*  it's like God put me in a perfect place. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6369.34s)]
*  Well, I got a question. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6371.0199999999995s)]
*  You ever seen a ghost? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6371.98s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6373.34s)]
*  Never. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6374.179999999999s)]
*  Do you believe in ghosts? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6375.179999999999s)]
*  If I did, I'd probably, like I'm so, I would accept it. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6376.0199999999995s)]
*  So I probably did, but just looked at it like that's a ghost. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6379.74s)]
*  I ain't be fucking with that motherfuckers. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6383.3s)]
*  Some shit like that. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6384.82s)]
*  I can't say off the top of my head [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6386.66s)]
*  where I just saw like a real motherfucker just appear. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6388.139999999999s)]
*  That? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6390.5s)]
*  Do you think aliens are real? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6391.34s)]
*  That wasn't a ghost. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6393.179999999999s)]
*  I think that was a lady that God used [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6394.0199999999995s)]
*  and it's like, I ain't done with him yet. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6396.78s)]
*  You think aliens are real? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6400.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6402.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, we would be arrogant to think [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6403.259999999999s)]
*  we the only motherfuckers on earth. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6404.9s)]
*  Do you think they're here? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6406.219999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, in Balls, you're so excited. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6407.78s)]
*  We so far behind in the universe shit, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6410.5s)]
*  they probably look at this shit like, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6413.139999999999s)]
*  yeah, it's like, why would we wanna go there? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6414.379999999999s)]
*  These motherfuckers just learning how to fly. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6417.179999999999s)]
*  We still don't know, fly yet. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6420.259999999999s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6422.62s)]
*  Okay, two things. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6424.54s)]
*  I think there's a whole nother entity or something [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6425.38s)]
*  that we beyond our brains. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6428.78s)]
*  Can't even see it, maybe. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6430.66s)]
*  Yeah, we don't realize how dumb we are. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6431.7s)]
*  Like, we really dumb. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6433.78s)]
*  Think about the shit 20 years ago. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6435.3s)]
*  We thought we were so smart and now this shit is seen. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6438.18s)]
*  Bro, I was just talking to a guy about this [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6441.7s)]
*  about germ theory. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6442.900000000001s)]
*  We didn't know about germs until like late 1800s, 1900s. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6443.9400000000005s)]
*  Let's use something simple. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6448.14s)]
*  This is where I come in. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6449.06s)]
*  Car, the engine in the car. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6450.3s)]
*  All them components in the engine. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6454.1s)]
*  Now you got a Tesla, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6456.26s)]
*  the only thing you got in that bitch is a battery. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6457.1s)]
*  Yep. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6458.5s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6459.34s)]
*  We could have been there that shit 50 years ago. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6460.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6462.660000000001s)]
*  But we was too stupid. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6463.9800000000005s)]
*  We want to overthink it. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6465.820000000001s)]
*  Well, over time we start realizing, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6467.900000000001s)]
*  we ain't gonna do all that. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6470.1s)]
*  Take that out. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6470.9400000000005s)]
*  Take that out. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6471.780000000001s)]
*  Take that out, use this. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6472.620000000001s)]
*  Boom, simple. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6474.5s)]
*  Okay, two things. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6475.860000000001s)]
*  One, your daughter is how old now? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6477.740000000001s)]
*  60. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6483.14s)]
*  16 years old. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6484.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6485.66s)]
*  Moments in her life that you really wish [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6487.379999999999s)]
*  that you had paid more attention or focused more. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6492.379999999999s)]
*  Like what happened? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6495.5s)]
*  You have 16 years of experience in something [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6496.5s)]
*  that I have one month of experience. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6498.339999999999s)]
*  So I just want- [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6500.179999999999s)]
*  There ain't no blueprint to this shit, bro. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6501.0199999999995s)]
*  Not how to do it, but like what are some things [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6502.78s)]
*  that like, that were just really special moments [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6505.0199999999995s)]
*  that you were glad that you were there, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6507.98s)]
*  really glad that you were present, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6510.54s)]
*  glad that you did not miss? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6511.7s)]
*  I just came to everything I could. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6514.66s)]
*  And like I say, technology worked in for me perfect. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6516.219999999999s)]
*  When I couldn't be there, the FaceTime. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6519.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6521.219999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6522.0599999999995s)]
*  Technology is really great, bro. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6522.9s)]
*  Like it works in your favor a lot, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6524.139999999999s)]
*  especially nowadays where we move and shit like that. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6525.58s)]
*  And then the bonding from day one, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6528.86s)]
*  a lot of stuff I had to be there as much as I wanted to be. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6531.0199999999995s)]
*  Because the bond was built early. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6534.94s)]
*  The bond was already built and I've always was in her life. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6536.299999999999s)]
*  And me being me kind of worked in my favor. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6540.0599999999995s)]
*  Because now I'm like, I'm cool with that. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6543.14s)]
*  Kids don't listen to parents, you know what I'm saying? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6546.42s)]
*  But unless you somebody, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6548.740000000001s)]
*  unless they look up to you like that, you know what I'm saying? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6551.22s)]
*  Most of the time when we look up to people, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6555.38s)]
*  we look up to people we wanna be like, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6556.700000000001s)]
*  you don't really wanna be like your mom or dad [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6558.38s)]
*  or some shit like that, where we came from. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6560.22s)]
*  So for me being who I am, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6562.38s)]
*  and I guess her friends or whatever, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6566.34s)]
*  it worked in my favor because like that's her dad [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6568.780000000001s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6570.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6571.700000000001s)]
*  Makes you proud. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6572.7s)]
*  You think she's as wise as you were at that age? [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6573.54s)]
*  Why is there less, you know what I mean? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6575.58s)]
*  The shit that's me is, I'm not, I don't, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6580.3s)]
*  it ain't me, right? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6583.46s)]
*  Like I can't put this on anybody. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6585.06s)]
*  I don't think everybody that's like me, they get it. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6586.9s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6590.62s)]
*  But I don't think it's supposed to be in her [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6591.46s)]
*  what I is the understanding I guess. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6593.58s)]
*  Does she know you love her? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6595.82s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6598.3s)]
*  Hell yeah she know. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6600.3s)]
*  I don't even have to question that. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6601.14s)]
*  Now I'm at the stage and I want her to, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6603.26s)]
*  I'm just trying to get her to understand, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6605.06s)]
*  cause she's real carefree like me. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6606.54s)]
*  I don't need her to be like that. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6609.46s)]
*  Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6610.740000000001s)]
*  I need her to get more hustle in her. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6612.3s)]
*  So now I'm just getting her to where she, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6614.26s)]
*  good thing about she, I guess you do got understanding [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6616.700000000001s)]
*  because 16, like, and I always tell like, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6618.860000000001s)]
*  you know you about to be grown, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6622.58s)]
*  like you're gonna be 18 in two years. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6623.740000000001s)]
*  But she was like, I ain't ready to be grown. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6626.26s)]
*  She's like, I don't feel like you should be grown [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6628.38s)]
*  to be like 30. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6629.82s)]
*  Which makes a lot of fucking sense. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6631.62s)]
*  So by her just understanding that, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6634.74s)]
*  it makes me feel like she do got a little understanding. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6637.66s)]
*  She understand that she ain't there yet. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6639.54s)]
*  That's a wise thought, yeah. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6643.099999999999s)]
*  So I guess she is wise. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6644.54s)]
*  She's still got a little bit of me in. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6646.259999999999s)]
*  And then final question before you go. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6648.139999999999s)]
*  Any regrets in your life? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6650.86s)]
*  Nope. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6652.5s)]
*  My shit is the best show ever, man. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6653.82s)]
*  I ain't got no regrets. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6656.74s)]
*  And then the little shit is just like, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6660.82s)]
*  I should have took that there, but it don't be shit. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6663.259999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6665.98s)]
*  Just little shit. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6666.82s)]
*  I shouldn't have tweeted that. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6668.0199999999995s)]
*  Some shit like that. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6669.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6670.219999999999s)]
*  But no, I ain't no, hell no. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6671.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, I can't think of a bad part of my life. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6673.9s)]
*  Like all that shit been good. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6676.5s)]
*  Even the accident. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6678.139999999999s)]
*  Now that I'm healed now, it's like, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6680.299999999999s)]
*  damn, that was a good part of the movie though. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6683.099999999999s)]
*  If it was a movie, that would be a good part. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6684.74s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6686.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6687.46s)]

*  Nope. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6689.7s)]
*  Do you think you've achieved your purpose? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6690.54s)]
*  I think I'm living in my purpose. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6692.0199999999995s)]
*  Until he ready for me, until it's time for me [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6693.62s)]
*  to transcend into whatever's next. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6697.66s)]

*  Shit, I could have made billions, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6731.42s)]
*  but it ain't nothing in there for me like that. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6733.299999999999s)]
*  It's more satisfaction than watching. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6736.34s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDdJvOAIG0&t=6738.38s)]
