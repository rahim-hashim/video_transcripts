*  That's crazy. There's no disrespect, but the feet were matching the dress and the bathing suit or [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=572.0s)]
*  whatever that was. This is crazy. And it looked great. And you looked tall, which is another thing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  You didn't look for a filter. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=579.52s)]
*  You didn't look for a filter. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=581.52s)]

*  That's crazy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=593.52s)]
*  We had a wonderful trip, man. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=595.52s)]
*  It was great. Dog loves the beach now. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=597.52s)]
*  So now we gotta go to the beach more. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=599.52s)]
*  Nobody cares about that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=601.52s)]
*  Whether your dog enjoys the beach. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=603.52s)]
*  I can't, dog. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=605.52s)]
*  She's so adorable. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=607.52s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=609.52s)]
*  Did you fly with your dog as a service animal? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=611.52s)]
*  Yeah, all the time. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=613.52s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=631.52s)]
*  Let's not do that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=633.52s)]
*  Hypothetically, if your mom worked at Fox Sports 1, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=635.52s)]
*  hypothetically, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=637.52s)]

*  with all due respect, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=643.52s)]
*  it's Foxy Sports 1, bro. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=645.52s)]
*  It's like how much is Skip throwing down? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=647.52s)]
*  That's what I'm just saying. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=649.52s)]
*  How much is Skip throwing down? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=651.52s)]
*  I don't know about the 1.5, but she's cool for a cool male. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=653.52s)]
*  That is weird. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=655.52s)]
*  The 1.5 is odd. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=657.52s)]
*  Can I ask you just this one question? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=659.52s)]
*  Initial offer. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=661.52s)]
*  It's like take a joke. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=663.52s)]
*  None of you are worth 1.5. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=665.52s)]
*  There's no girl on the planet worth 1.5. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=667.52s)]
*  But the 0.5 throws me off. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=669.52s)]
*  Why you had to account for inflation? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=671.52s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=673.52s)]
*  Can I just be honest with you? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=675.52s)]
*  It's horrible that if something happened to this girl [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=677.52s)]
*  and she was experiencing sexual harassment [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=679.52s)]
*  or workplaces or whatever, that's bad. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=681.52s)]
*  And you shouldn't do this fucked up. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=683.52s)]
*  But you're not worth 1.5. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=685.52s)]
*  That is the joke. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=687.52s)]
*  You have to look yourself in the mirror and be like, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=689.52s)]
*  1.5? You're getting paid 60 grand a year to put blush on Skip Bailes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=691.52s)]
*  You don't get 1.5 to suck him down while he's wearing Jordan 11s. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=695.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=699.52s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=701.52s)]
*  1.5 is sarcasm. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=703.52s)]
*  1.5 is like... [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=705.52s)]

*  Is that an illegal thing? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=733.52s)]
*  That's an interesting question. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=735.52s)]
*  Deadass. I'm being deadass. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=737.52s)]

*  He wasn't the whore. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=755.52s)]
*  It doesn't need to happen. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=757.52s)]
*  The transaction of goods needs to happen. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=759.52s)]
*  If I ask to buy weed from you, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=761.52s)]

*  You could be like, all right bet. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=769.52s)]
*  But unless I give you that money, it's not illegal. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=771.52s)]
*  Solicitation. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=773.52s)]
*  That's what I'm reading. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=775.52s)]

*  We don't know what it does to y'all. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=791.52s)]
*  So just take that with a grain of salt. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=793.52s)]

*  I got diarrhea for three days. So it can't be that bad. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=807.52s)]
*  Vitamin C can give you diarrhea. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=809.52s)]
*  It might be vitamin C. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=811.52s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. We need some bread if we're doing this every single time in the pocket. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=813.52s)]
*  But we don't promote it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=815.52s)]

*  But let's go. Generational triumph. I love y'all. Thank you. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=989.52s)]
*  Got out to your mom. I think she's beautiful. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=991.52s)]
*  And she had two kids. And once you have kids, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=993.52s)]
*  I feel like sexual harassment, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=995.52s)]
*  if you come back from kids, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=997.52s)]
*  all of that you need to fill. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=999.52s)]
*  You need to fill women who've had kids with sexual harassment. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1001.52s)]
*  Or else they'll feel like shit. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1003.52s)]
*  So your wife should be filled with sexual harassment? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1005.52s)]
*  Yo, I don't think you thought this through. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1007.52s)]
*  On some levels. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1009.52s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1011.52s)]
*  I think you painted him into a corner. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1013.52s)]
*  I look at my wife, got her body back after having a kid, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1015.52s)]
*  I'm like, God damn you. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1017.52s)]
*  Okay, shit. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1019.52s)]
*  I don't even think it's thirst trapping anymore. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1021.52s)]
*  I think it's like a marathon. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1023.52s)]
*  So if Skip Bale's propositioned her, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1025.52s)]
*  you'd be like, that's what's up. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1027.52s)]
*  Thank you, Skip. 1.5? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1029.52s)]
*  We gotta have a combo about 1.5. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1031.52s)]
*  Shit. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1033.52s)]
*  You know, 1.5? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1035.52s)]
*  You haven't been risking my life going to Saudi Arabia [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1037.52s)]
*  to do comedy shows, and we can get 1.5? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1039.52s)]
*  But nah, you can't do that, Skip. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1041.52s)]
*  Come on, Skip. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1043.52s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1045.52s)]
*  He said this guy. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1047.52s)]
*  I feel like you should be able to offer without getting fired. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1049.52s)]
*  Bro, why? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1053.52s)]
*  He did this for her ago. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1055.52s)]
*  You know, he started getting in shape around about the time [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1057.52s)]
*  she started working there, seems like. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1059.52s)]
*  This is like the definition of me too. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1061.52s)]
*  Is that me too? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1063.52s)]
*  He's her boss. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1065.52s)]
*  So if she turns it down, she can feel like, oh, I'm gonna get fired. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1067.52s)]
*  He said shit like, you're not gonna be on this network as much. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1069.52s)]
*  No, no, that is where it's at. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1073.52s)]
*  You can't threaten someone's job. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1075.52s)]
*  I looked at that, you cannot withhold anything from them. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1077.52s)]
*  You're not trying to take anything away, you're just trying to offer. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1079.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1081.52s)]
*  Hey, you're gonna get this 1.5, but you still gotta do my lip liner. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1083.52s)]
*  You still gotta come to work. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1087.52s)]
*  You can't get this one, but it's gonna be installments, it's gonna be one of them [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1089.52s)]
*  when you win the lottery. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1091.52s)]
*  But you get the weak one. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1093.52s)]
*  That's a lump sum up front, dog. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1095.52s)]
*  But what if that's not, then you get 1.2? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1097.52s)]
*  Put it in an escrow. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1099.52s)]
*  I'm just saying, I think we have to, in Trump's America in 2025, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1101.52s)]
*  I think we have to loosen the reins a little bit about what it means. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1103.52s)]
*  You know how, remember when they tried to say that we couldn't drink [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1109.52s)]
*  a large Coca-Cola in New York? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1111.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1113.52s)]
*  That's how I feel about sexual harassment. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1115.52s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1117.52s)]
*  Some of these girls need two leaders. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1119.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1121.52s)]
*  Some of these girls need two, if Al respectfully, with all due respect, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1123.52s)]
*  to my home or on Instagram, we should be able to comment on that, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1127.52s)]
*  two leaders. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1131.52s)]
*  You can't tell me the leaders of sexual harassment. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1133.52s)]
*  You can't tell me the leaders of sexual harassment. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1135.52s)]
*  You can't tell me the leaders of sexual harassment. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1137.52s)]
*  You put our feet up, dog. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1139.52s)]
*  I didn't know your feet. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1141.52s)]
*  I did it because you were thirst-driving. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1143.52s)]
*  You put your mom's feet on the internet, bro. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1145.52s)]
*  You put your mom's feet on the internet. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1147.52s)]
*  I was looking at Hell's Body. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1149.52s)]
*  I think that the sexual harassment can be framed not in terms of sex, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1151.52s)]
*  but in terms of like, wow, for your age you look amazing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1155.52s)]
*  Wow, for having a child and you got your body back, that's amazing. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1159.52s)]
*  I don't think any woman would take that the wrong way. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1162.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a compliment. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1164.52s)]
*  You could do makeup, but you could make 1.5 million [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1166.52s)]
*  burying your face into my crotch. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1168.52s)]
*  That seems a little different than the other two examples I've heard. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1170.52s)]
*  It's slightly different, but I see where you're going. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1173.52s)]
*  Why is that so different? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1175.52s)]
*  You can't do cash, but what if you bought her a Rolex or something? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1177.52s)]
*  Then I think, then you're just married. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1182.52s)]
*  That is just permissible. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1184.52s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1186.52s)]
*  You think I got head off of that Rolex? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1187.52s)]
*  You gotta get something, bro. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1189.52s)]
*  That is another thing that we need to discuss. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1190.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1192.52s)]

*  Jerry Jones is last week in the regular season. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1423.52s)]
*  He could be doing his job as a GM. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1426.52s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1428.52s)]
*  He partied with the family St. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1429.52s)]
*  Bart's. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1430.52s)]
*  So Dove sees Jerry Jones go to the bathroom and Dove follows him to the bathroom. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1431.52s)]
*  And on the way back starts chopping him up. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1435.52s)]
*  Charlotte got no clue. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1437.52s)]
*  When he comes back to the bathroom, he comes up to the table. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1438.52s)]
*  Keep in mind, the whole place knows it's fucking Jerry Jones. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1440.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1443.52s)]
*  He comes up to the table, says, what's up, Charlemagne? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1444.52s)]
*  Charlemagne is in his ear. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1446.52s)]
*  What did Dove do to him in the bathroom? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1447.52s)]
*  In the bathroom. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1449.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1450.52s)]
*  Jerry's about that action. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1451.52s)]
*  I'm waiting for one of these cases to pop up. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1453.52s)]
*  Yo, yo, yo, yo. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1455.52s)]
*  Come on. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1456.52s)]
*  Why are y'all suffering in silence, ladies? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1457.52s)]
*  You hate the cowboys. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1460.52s)]
*  Why are y'all suffering in silence? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1461.52s)]
*  Can we have any fun? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1463.52s)]
*  Jerry, we're sorry, Jerry. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1465.52s)]
*  Jerry, you're a good man. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1466.52s)]
*  You're a good man. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1468.52s)]
*  He's not looking at people's feet. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1469.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1470.52s)]
*  You just, you had a bad season. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1471.52s)]
*  That's all. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1472.52s)]
*  Looking is looking. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1473.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1474.52s)]
*  I can't look. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1475.52s)]
*  You know, Jerry liked to party though. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1476.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1478.52s)]
*  Because we offered him a shot and he was like, I should. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1479.52s)]
*  All right, give me the shot. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1481.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1482.52s)]
*  Kneeling through the back. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1483.52s)]
*  Anyway, that was a cool moment to see them. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1484.52s)]
*  He called me to fucking put me through misery. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1486.52s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1489.52s)]
*  He called me this man. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1490.52s)]
*  I was excited. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1491.52s)]
*  I thought he had great news. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1492.52s)]
*  Then he sends me the video. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1493.52s)]
*  I'm like, fuck this guy. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1494.52s)]
*  Poison the water. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1495.52s)]
*  Fuck that guy. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1496.52s)]
*  So anyway, it was fun. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1499.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1501.52s)]
*  Has that always been a new year spot for celebrity rich people? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1502.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1506.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1507.52s)]
*  So basically like St. Bart's Island. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1508.52s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1509.52s)]
*  I'm about to ruin it right now. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1510.52s)]
*  I'm just letting y'all know. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1511.52s)]
*  But it's like the old money starts seeing him come. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1512.52s)]
*  I mean, that's why Jerry left. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1513.52s)]
*  He's like, there's a black guy. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1514.52s)]
*  No, he's like, there's a black guy at the table. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1515.52s)]
*  Does he play? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1516.52s)]
*  He thought he was a runner. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1517.52s)]
*  He said, what are you doing here? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1518.52s)]
*  We're both not supposed to be here. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1519.52s)]
*  No. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1520.52s)]
*  And so basically, it's this island of the Caribbean. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1521.52s)]
*  There's no people in D.C. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1522.52s)]
*  And it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=1523.52s)]

*  we spoke about this last pot. Who's that? She had a glow up now. Her face. Yeah, Lindsay [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3201.52s)]
*  Lohan looks incredible. Yeah. So Lucy was a joy. Wow. I actually like no makeup. Yeah, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3208.72s)]
*  I prefer. Well, there is makeup. It's just this is modern makeup. Oh, I pretty much prefer. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3217.84s)]
*  So it's basically what would you look like? She looks better on the right. I mean, Marilyn [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3222.52s)]
*  Monroe is just like stunning both proper piece. She left her husband. She was like, I'm going [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3225.56s)]
*  to the game. So after one point five minutes out of this, isn't that great? I think he like [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3231.52s)]
*  remarried. He just lived like his regular life in Cleveland or something. Wow. And you're [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3237.52s)]
*  like, you know, you were tagging Marilyn Monroe. What do you what was like? I mean, that's [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3241.52s)]
*  yeah, she's been we remember Marilyn Monroe as this kind of like famous slut. But she's [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3246.52s)]
*  beloved. You know, she's fucking married men. She's like, she's out there. She's doing her [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3253.52s)]
*  thing. She's like throwing the ass around or whatever skirts popping up with the wind. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3257.52s)]
*  Was she scrutinized or did women have like so few public voices back in the day that [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3262.52s)]
*  there just wasn't that much scrutiny? Like now every female podcast would be like, oh, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3268.52s)]
*  who's this bitch fucking all the married men? What a slut? How dare she? But there just [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3273.52s)]
*  weren't shows for them to be empowering. Whatever. Don't slut shame. But yeah, I think I don't [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3277.52s)]
*  even think I think fucking married men, they don't care about their own sex. They don't [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3281.52s)]
*  they don't count as the umbrella of slut shaming. I think most women, if you're out there [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3286.52s)]
*  like fucking married guys, they're like, fuck, fuck single dudes. Yeah, fair enough. That's [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3292.52s)]
*  a good distinction. But back then, did they know that she was doing all that back then? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3296.52s)]
*  That's the other thing I'm wondering. The media was so controlled back then. I don't think [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3300.52s)]
*  the three news channels are going to be like, hey, guess who Marilyn Monroe is fucking the [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3304.52s)]
*  president. And there was more respect for politicians back then. You didn't expose their shit. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3308.52s)]
*  Yeah. So our idea of Marilyn Monroe now is she's like this hoe that's all empowered. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3312.52s)]
*  But back in the day, she was just this beautiful girl with Joe DiMaggio publicly. You didn't [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3318.52s)]
*  know what she's doing on the side. And now I think I didn't watch the movie, but apparently [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3323.52s)]
*  the movie about her, it's like dark, but it kind of paints her in a simple sympathetic [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3327.52s)]
*  light. Like she got taken advantage of by a lot of guys, blah, blah, blah, whatever. I think [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3331.52s)]
*  addicted to drugs. They like kind of fed the addiction, whatever. I don't know. I didn't [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3335.52s)]
*  watch, but now I think it's turning again where she's going to be painted as kind of [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3338.52s)]
*  a tragic figure. Interesting. I mean, it seems like she was scrutinized slightly in her time. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3342.52s)]
*  She was viewed as a commodity. She wasn't easy to work with. She never knew her lines. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3348.52s)]
*  And like the slut stuff, it seems like as much. That's more what I'm talking about. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3352.52s)]
*  Like now she is she's like beloved and emulated, like wearing her dress to the Golden [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3356.52s)]
*  Globes. I remember one year Kim Kardashian, something like that. And like you're wearing [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3364.52s)]
*  like an old whore's dress, but it's if the dress fits, but isn't it? It's kind of am I taking [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3369.52s)]
*  like a weird angle on this? I know it makes sense. No, I think because she was already beloved [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3377.52s)]
*  before we found out this stuff. And then I think she died tragically, right? She died young. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3382.52s)]
*  So we're good. Yeah, exactly. Life. Maybe we look at her a little bit differently. Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3385.52s)]
*  If you live a long life, you have tons of money and everything worked out for you. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3390.52s)]
*  We go fuck you bitch. Why are you having sex with all these married dudes and breaking up their homes? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3394.52s)]
*  If you die tragically, you're like she lived hard. Yeah. Died young. Yeah. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3398.52s)]
*  Also, according to this random comment I found on Reddit, seems like she was seen as classy and elegant on screen. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3404.52s)]
*  She was also funny on screen. She was like comedic. She was a comedic relief sometimes. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3409.52s)]
*  Oh, really? Shows and movies. God bless. So she went from pinups like a starlet where people are like, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3413.52s)]
*  yeah, she's like the epitome of elegance. And there was also probably so few famous people, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3417.52s)]
*  like they're making way less movies. So the famous people of the time were probably revered. Oh, absolutely. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3422.52s)]
*  Regardless of their behavior. Yeah. Now there's so many little micro celebrities yelling at you. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3427.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. I can recognize walking on the street. Nobody gives a fuck outside of like those people. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3432.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? Nobody cares. Back then it's like 10 celebrities. That's it. And I love them. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3436.52s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. So talking is real, turns out. Fuck off. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3442.52s)]
*  All right, guys, take a break for a second. I got to talk to you guys about Odoo. OK, you're starting a business. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3447.52s)]
*  When you start a business, there are many things that you have to pay for, many services that you have to pay for in order to make that business function. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3453.52s)]
*  They could be simple things like doing your books. They could be building a website. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3461.52s)]
*  And there ends up being tens of hundreds of these little individual things that you are going to get subscriptions for. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3467.52s)]
*  You're going to buy straight out. And that's where Odoo comes in. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3474.52s)]
*  Odoo is an all in one platform that combines practically every single tool that you could pay for as a business under one roof. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3478.52s)]
*  You can save hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars by making the switch to Odoo. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3484.52s)]
*  They have a time tracking platform so employees can track their hours worked and accounting platform to replace quick books, invoicing and much more. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3490.52s)]
*  Plans start for as low as twenty four dollars and ninety cents a month per user. Think about it. DocuSign. Right. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3497.52s)]
*  I'm sure you guys have used DocuSign before allows you to sign documents digitally. That's twenty five dollars a month. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3503.52s)]
*  So for less than DocuSign, you can use Odoo's signature platform for the same price while having access to every other business tool. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3508.52s)]
*  And this is free. Your first app on Odoo is free for life with unlimited hosting and support and a free personalized domain name for an entire year. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3516.52s)]
*  If this sounds useful to you, go to Odoo.com slash flagrant to get started with Odoo. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3525.52s)]
*  That is O D O O for free. Now let's get back to the show. All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3531.52s)]
*  Guys, Magic Spoon. They stepped the game up, man. It's not just the serial anymore. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3537.52s)]
*  Obviously, we know Magic Spoon. They got the bangers. OK, one of the first serial companies that I would say that really took advantage of the podcast market. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3543.52s)]
*  I think there's been a lot of loyalty and support shown by the podcast listeners to this brand. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3550.52s)]
*  Well, you know what they're doing? They are turning their high protein cereal into high protein treats that are light, crispy and taste just like those classic crunchy cereal bars. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3555.52s)]
*  That's right. They got the cereal bars. They're also launching a brand new high protein granola. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3566.52s)]
*  Yes, you heard it. High protein granola. True to the Magic Spoon promise. It's packed with protein. Tastes amazing. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3571.52s)]
*  It's perfect for breakfast or just a snack match. Magic Spoon's high protein treats are crispy, crunchy, airy and an easy way to get 12 grams of protein on the go. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3577.52s)]
*  They come in mouth-watering flavors like marshmallow, chocolate, peanut butter and dark chocolate. Magic Spoon's brand new granola packs 13 grams of protein and zero added sugars. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3587.52s)]
*  They come in delicious flavors, honey, almond and peanut butter. So right now you can get $5 off your next order at Magicspoon.com slash flagrant or look for Magic Spoon on Amazon or in your nearest grocery store. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3597.52s)]
*  That's Magicspoon.com slash flagrant for $5 off. Now let's get back to the show. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3610.52s)]
*  What do you guys think about not to grab a topic off of off of that list here, but I'm going to. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3614.52s)]
*  Drake. Drake puts out the disc to LeBron seemingly. Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3624.52s)]
*  What do you how do you guys feel about that? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3634.52s)]
*  One, it seems to have leaked. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3637.52s)]
*  Oh, he didn't leak it himself. No, it wasn't his account that posted it. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3639.52s)]
*  Do you think it was like an organized leak? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3644.52s)]
*  Knowing him, it could be because he's done that in the past. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3646.52s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like he wasn't exactly catching the beat the whole time. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3649.52s)]
*  And he's like just reading off his phone. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3654.52s)]
*  It seemed like he was like, hey, I just wrote this verse. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3656.52s)]
*  I'm going to send it to somebody to check it out and tell me what you think about it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3658.52s)]
*  Like that's what it seems like. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3662.52s)]
*  Because in the video, he's like, oh, you know, like it looked like, OK, ready, go. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3663.52s)]
*  That type of shit. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3668.52s)]
*  I mean, that's a smart way to put it out, because if people don't fuck with it, then you get to be like, I didn't even put that shit out. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3669.52s)]
*  You all were not even done with it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3675.52s)]
*  And if it blows up, it's basically like creating the lowest expectations so you can overdeliver. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3676.52s)]
*  Yeah. Interesting. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3681.52s)]
*  Keep going. Yeah. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3682.52s)]
*  And yeah, like to take shots at Braun, it's. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3683.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3688.52s)]
*  Like you have him tatted on you. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3690.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3691.52s)]
*  Best friends for Madlong. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3692.52s)]
*  You pretty much their careers were coming up around the same time and they both were number one for the longest. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3694.52s)]
*  And so it's not clear. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3701.52s)]
*  This is it's hard to really say that this is a brand. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3703.52s)]
*  OK, let's assume it is. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3706.52s)]
*  OK, just because the name is fighting Irish. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3709.52s)]
*  But then again, if he doesn't name the song, how do we know what it is? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3712.52s)]
*  It's shrouded in shrouded in enough mystery where I feel like Drake can protect his relationship if he wants. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3715.52s)]
*  But it seems like there's some maybe bars thrown in that direction. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3721.52s)]
*  I think it's smart strategic move like, all right, let's get away from this Kendrick thing. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3725.52s)]
*  We'll go towards an even bigger figure, which is LeBron and low key. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3729.52s)]
*  I think there's sympathy. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3734.52s)]
*  Like I felt sympathetic because if that's your boy, you got his fucking jersey tatted on your arm, your homies forever. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3736.52s)]
*  And he shows up to this other guy who I don't even know if you're close to him like that. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3744.52s)]
*  No. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3749.52s)]
*  He shows up to the show. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3750.52s)]
*  He's rapping all the words. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3751.52s)]
*  He's cosigning the fuck out of it. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3752.52s)]
*  I would feel I probably feel hurt. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3754.52s)]
*  I probably feel like one of my friends let me down. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3757.52s)]
*  More justified than all the other shit. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3760.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3762.52s)]
*  And also, you know, if he is alleging certain things like, you know, we did work together, we did fuck shit like you're out here. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3763.52s)]
*  Why are you acting like I don't know things? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3770.52s)]
*  Like if they're as close as the media has portrayed it and maybe they have even portrayed it. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3774.52s)]
*  They have portrayed it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3781.52s)]
*  I mean, look at his fucking arm. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3782.52s)]
*  Exactly. If they're that close and you were doing that to my op, I would feel away. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3783.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3787.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3788.52s)]
*  And I think he's justified. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3789.52s)]
*  And this is his best received, seems like his most well received song since the battle. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3790.52s)]
*  This is the one that people are like, oh, maybe he's back to rapping, whatever. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3793.52s)]
*  I do think the way LeBron distanced himself, something happened. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3797.52s)]
*  Because when Drake lost, and I brought this up on the call, when Drake lost the push a T battle, LeBron brought him on the shop, did like a whole PR piece essentially. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3802.52s)]
*  So like a 20 minute, you're my man, you can't possibly disappoint me, protect your peace, blah, blah, blah. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3810.52s)]
*  I got you. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3815.52s)]
*  I'm holding you down. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3816.52s)]
*  Now this battle, LeBron is kind of making it a point to let you know whose side he's on. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3817.52s)]
*  So something happened. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3822.52s)]
*  I don't know what it was, but I don't think it was just, I don't think it was just LeBron switching up. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3823.52s)]
*  Because wasn't Drake pulling up to Bronnie's games when he was in high school? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3827.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3830.52s)]
*  Like that doesn't really help Drake. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3831.52s)]
*  I feel like if anything, that helps build the stock of Bronnie. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3834.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3837.52s)]
*  So you invested in the family and then all LeBron has to do is not go to the concert. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3838.52s)]
*  It's a very easy thing to not go to. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3843.52s)]
*  Oh no, he's rapping the words if you like that. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3846.52s)]
*  He's going to the concert. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3849.52s)]
*  He's with Steph Curry. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3851.52s)]
*  Steph at the Olympics is like, they're playing the song, not like us. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3852.52s)]
*  And Steph is like, I'm so sick of this song. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3855.52s)]
*  Is it the only fucking song in the world? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3857.52s)]
*  And LeBron is like, I love it. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3859.52s)]
*  I think LeBron is making it a point to let everybody know he's not riding for this guy. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3860.52s)]
*  So why is that? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3865.52s)]
*  That's what I think's I'm happy. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3867.52s)]
*  Because I don't see LeBron as like a flipping guy. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3869.52s)]
*  He's someone that knows the power of teamwork and reputation and relationships. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3871.52s)]
*  All of LeBron's old teammates seem, not all, most of them seem to really still like him. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3875.52s)]
*  He's beloved and respected. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3880.52s)]
*  Kevin loves him, gasses him, loves him like he's incredible. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3882.52s)]
*  Even guys that don't play on his team, they'll defend him with this fervor. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3886.52s)]
*  You know, like, nah, he's the guy. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3890.52s)]
*  How dare you talk about him like Usain LeBron is not as good as this guy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3892.52s)]
*  He's the best still in the league. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3894.52s)]
*  I think it was Kevin Garnett went on like a spirited tirade defending LeBron. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3895.52s)]
*  And they were rivals. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3899.52s)]
*  They were heated rivals. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3900.52s)]
*  Maybe it was a business deal. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3901.52s)]
*  This one's hard. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3903.52s)]
*  This one's hard because that battle was just such a fun thing for everybody in rap. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3904.52s)]
*  And it was like, even if I'm a Drake fan and I still was loving some of Kendrick's songs. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3909.52s)]
*  Like, so it's like you get swept up in that whole shit. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3916.52s)]
*  Plus, he's Mr. L.A. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3918.52s)]
*  You're Mr. Lakers Showtime. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3920.52s)]
*  You're in the city. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3922.52s)]
*  You're in it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3923.52s)]
*  People don't. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3925.52s)]
*  Yeah, we're outside. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3926.52s)]
*  If you're in L.A. during that time and everybody is just riding super high, the whole city is congealed around this one dude. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3927.52s)]
*  Yeah, you want to be at the concert, the biggest concert of fucking the year. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3935.52s)]
*  But what has he done in support of Drake since? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3938.52s)]
*  Again, think about dog. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3941.52s)]
*  What is it? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3943.52s)]
*  Addie Dawn? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3944.52s)]
*  When that came out, that was insane. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3945.52s)]
*  We had never seen any shit like that. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3947.52s)]
*  You are hiding a child. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3949.52s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3951.52s)]
*  And he made it at the time. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3952.52s)]
*  We all felt like, oh, Drake wasn't saving his son and protecting his son. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3953.52s)]
*  He's hiding this child. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3956.52s)]
*  He's ashamed of this child. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3957.52s)]
*  LeBron brings them on. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3958.52s)]
*  Let me help you out. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3959.52s)]
*  I got you. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3960.52s)]
*  Let's flip this whole thing. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3961.52s)]
*  He hasn't done anything for Drake, it seems. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3962.52s)]
*  But I mean, what is what can he do? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3964.52s)]
*  Sons rap along to family matters. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3967.52s)]
*  Or he'll put a video of himself rapping. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3969.52s)]
*  Or don't go to the pop out. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3972.52s)]
*  Sometimes not going or not being part of something, not supporting something is the greatest support for the opposition. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3974.52s)]
*  I think that's what 21 did. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3982.52s)]
*  They asked him, you're from Atlanta and you work with Drake. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3983.52s)]
*  What do you think of this whole beef? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3986.52s)]
*  I think he was just like, yeah, I make music. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3987.52s)]
*  I'm just enjoying it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3989.52s)]
*  I just make music. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3990.52s)]
*  He basically just kind of stepped out from my knowledge. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3991.52s)]
*  So LeBron could have done the same thing. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3993.52s)]
*  And it seems like he had a reason. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3995.52s)]
*  You brought it up and I didn't actually think as much of it at the time. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3996.52s)]
*  But when he was wrapping all the words like that at the game, you were like, LeBron never knows the words. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=3999.52s)]
*  That's like the way I think about it at the time. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4003.52s)]
*  I said, no, he's whatever. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4007.52s)]
*  He just likes a song because I didn't understand, I guess, the weight of what was coming. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4008.52s)]
*  But even at that point, he's making everybody know, making sure everybody knows I know this fucking song. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4012.52s)]
*  I got all the words right on this. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4017.52s)]
*  And then it just kept going. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4019.52s)]
*  And this is one of those peculiar things because I could see where there are other musicians that aren't as popular as Drake. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4021.52s)]
*  They want to see the top guy fall. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4027.52s)]
*  It's a very natural human instinct. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4029.52s)]
*  There is a person who's got the crown. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4031.52s)]
*  You want to see that crown get knocked off. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4032.52s)]
*  And then after it gets knocked off, you're like, OK, we put the crown back on. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4034.52s)]
*  But everybody wants to see someone bleed. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4037.52s)]
*  That 300 scene where the Persian guy gets that little cut. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4038.52s)]
*  And it's like, OK, we just want to see that it's possible. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4042.52s)]
*  So I understand that from definitely other musicians and just like kind of maybe fans of music, definitely Kendrick fans, even West Coast fans. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4045.52s)]
*  And maybe there's probably some Drake haters. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4053.52s)]
*  I get that. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4055.52s)]
*  But LeBron is bigger than Drake. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4056.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4059.52s)]
*  Like, at least in my estimation. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4060.52s)]
*  Globally, yeah. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4061.52s)]
*  I would say he's a big. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4062.52s)]
*  So now I know it gets tricky because music travels in a different way than basketball. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4063.52s)]
*  But LeBron is more wealthy than Drake. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4068.52s)]
*  You could argue more powerful than Drake. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4071.52s)]
*  I don't see a reason to be envious of Drake and wanting to see the crown fall off. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4074.52s)]
*  I could see that from people beneath them. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4080.52s)]
*  When you're beneath somebody, you want to see somebody go down. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4082.52s)]
*  That's a pretty normal human instinct. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4084.52s)]
*  But when you're above somebody, you shouldn't have that same feeling like anybody who had beef with growing coming up in comedy. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4086.52s)]
*  Once I like pass them my like animosity towards them melted away. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4093.52s)]
*  Even if you treat me like shit on the way up, like once I got past, I was like, all right, whatever. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4098.52s)]
*  You're a bitter guy, but that's fine. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4102.52s)]
*  I can't fathom why. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4104.52s)]
*  And I think we would have to just ask Braun because it's like if he imagine if he's just looking at it like, yo, this is sport and I enjoyed the battle. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4106.52s)]
*  So now he's not looking at it like I'm sliding the other guy I'm just enjoying. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4115.52s)]
*  I thought about that. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4119.52s)]
*  There is one little issue about this. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4120.52s)]
*  The whole song is calling your man a pedophile. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4122.52s)]
*  So now you look at two things. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4126.52s)]
*  It's like if he's a pedophile, why were you kicking with him a whole time? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4128.52s)]
*  No, I don't think he's a pedophile. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4133.52s)]
*  Of course. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4134.52s)]
*  But it's different than like, fuck you. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4135.52s)]
*  I'm a better rapper than you. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4137.52s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4138.52s)]
*  You're fat or you get your abs done or what the other shit. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4139.52s)]
*  Yeah, the pedophile thing is different and just reinforcing and supporting that narrative in any way feels a little bit separate than sport. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4141.52s)]
*  Doug, I'm a we've all I've made it known. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4151.52s)]
*  I'm a big Kendrick fan. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4154.52s)]
*  I love the battle. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4155.52s)]
*  He did the shit I saw at Schultz. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4156.52s)]
*  I'm not going to the concert. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4157.52s)]
*  It's not just not happening. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4159.52s)]
*  We can't go to Kendrick concert. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4161.52s)]
*  I mean, we're gonna go together. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4163.52s)]
*  Yeah, boo and solidarity. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4164.52s)]
*  He knows I'll go. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4166.52s)]
*  Until he puts on a fire song. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4168.52s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4169.52s)]
*  I'm gonna still watch the Super Bowl halftime show. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4170.52s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4174.52s)]
*  But I don't say anything to him. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4175.52s)]
*  You'll just see me at the concert fucking rapping along to that line. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4178.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4182.52s)]
*  Once you when he says that song, I'm whatever. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4183.52s)]
*  Got you. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4185.52s)]
*  I'm screaming that shit. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4186.52s)]
*  Dancing. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4188.52s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4189.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4190.52s)]
*  Who is your number one artist? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4191.52s)]
*  Kendrick. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4192.52s)]
*  We got to check. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4193.52s)]
*  I got no responsibility. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4195.52s)]
*  December. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4199.52s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4200.52s)]
*  It's like if you're rocking with somebody, you're going to rock with them. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4204.52s)]
*  That's my brother. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4207.52s)]
*  You're my brother. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4208.52s)]
*  And LeBron and Drake were brothers as far as we knew. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4209.52s)]
*  They said that. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4211.52s)]
*  They're like, dude, go back and watch that fucking barbershop shit. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4212.52s)]
*  Charlamagne gets a bar from Drake where I think Drake is critical of Charlamagne. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4215.52s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4219.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4220.52s)]
*  I'm not blasting that song. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4221.52s)]
*  I'm not posting on social media. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4222.52s)]
*  I'm not rapping those words because it's like, yo, you taking a shot at my boy? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4224.52s)]
*  Back to back, we were kind of saying, just send bottles to Charlamagne. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4230.52s)]
*  No, but it was not a good thing. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4234.52s)]
*  Was that a good thing? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4235.52s)]
*  I thought he passed it up. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4236.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4237.52s)]
*  That was a good thing. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4238.52s)]
*  I thought it was like, yeah, I thought that was like, whatever. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4239.52s)]
*  Charlamagne's in hip hop history. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4241.52s)]
*  I saw that as a win for Charlamagne. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4243.52s)]
*  But even then, if Drake calls Charlamagne a pedophile, we're not going to the Drake concert. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4244.52s)]
*  We're not. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4250.52s)]
*  I'm not going regardless. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4251.52s)]
*  Or we're going to dress as children. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4252.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4254.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4255.52s)]
*  And we can try to fuck them. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4256.52s)]
*  So Al's regular outfit. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4257.52s)]
*  There were other lines in the song though that stuck out when he says he was in the Hamptons. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4260.52s)]
*  Stuck out. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4267.52s)]
*  Stuck out. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4268.52s)]
*  Stuck out. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4269.52s)]
*  I said stuck out. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4270.52s)]
*  He said close enough. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4271.52s)]
*  He wasn't sure if it was stuck or stuck. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4272.52s)]
*  He kind of stuck out in between. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4274.52s)]
*  They stuck out. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4276.52s)]
*  And I was going to let it slide. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4277.52s)]
*  I hope you were in the wide for that. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4279.52s)]
*  You guys are assholes. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4282.52s)]
*  Look at Al Gibbs, Akash, when you said that. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4283.52s)]
*  It's in the song. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4287.52s)]
*  Let's just let it slide. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4288.52s)]
*  Let me not. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4289.52s)]
*  If there's ever a diss song about you, Al's showing up at the concert. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4290.52s)]
*  Oh, I'll go. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4293.52s)]
*  I'll go. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4294.52s)]
*  I'll go to that fucking concert. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4295.52s)]
*  He said stuck out. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4299.52s)]
*  He thought you was Scott Freeh. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4301.52s)]
*  He just goes, stuck out. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4303.52s)]
*  And I go, I said stuck out. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4305.52s)]
*  I'll be crip walking on stage all the way. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4310.52s)]
*  Fuck that shit. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4312.52s)]
*  No, but you were saying, yeah. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4313.52s)]
*  Fuck me. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4315.52s)]
*  But the line about going to the Hamptons and giving people cold shoulders, and that was [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4316.52s)]
*  indicative of Wayne, little Wayne was at that same party, the Michael Rubin all-white [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4322.52s)]
*  party, and he was like the only person who said hi to me here was Glorilla. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4327.52s)]
*  So I think they have beef. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4331.52s)]
*  So it's like Drake is kind of pointing out how everybody is against them right now in [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4333.52s)]
*  this song. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4338.52s)]
*  Even Wayne? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4339.52s)]
*  I think Wayne. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4340.52s)]
*  I think that's a line. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4341.52s)]
*  So at what point is it you, dawg, at JLo? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4342.52s)]
*  Because Wayne didn't really come to his back. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4344.52s)]
*  He didn't really do anything. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4348.52s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4349.52s)]
*  I totally get that. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4350.52s)]
*  At what point is it you? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4351.52s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4352.52s)]
*  God. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4353.52s)]
*  You said he didn't really come in his back or something. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4354.52s)]
*  He didn't really come in his back. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4355.52s)]
*  Come on. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4356.52s)]
*  Maybe I'm horny, bro. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4357.52s)]
*  Maybe I'm horny. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4358.52s)]
*  He's been a kid for a long time. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4359.52s)]
*  He didn't even get to his back, bro. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4360.52s)]
*  He didn't get to his shit. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4361.52s)]
*  I'll live, bro. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4362.52s)]
*  Sorry, Alan. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4363.52s)]
*  What were you thinking? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4364.52s)]
*  I was thinking, I'm going to go to the Hamptons and give people cold shoulders. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4365.52s)]
*  I was thinking that joke and then he saw it in my head. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4367.52s)]
*  How the fuck did you do that? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4370.52s)]
*  I was thinking, thank you, bro. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4371.52s)]
*  That's how you get all the good jokes down there. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4372.52s)]
*  Talking about shit. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4373.52s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4374.52s)]
*  What was the point that you just said? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4375.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4376.52s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4402.52s)]

*  Not fuck you like me fucking, all these people don't like you, so they're like, yo, fuck [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4409.120000000001s)]
*  you. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4412.52s)]
*  There's another part of me that's like, and we know this from comedy, like there are people [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4413.52s)]
*  who are your friends and there are people who are your friends because things are working [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4417.160000000001s)]
*  out. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4420.6s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4421.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4422.6s)]
*  And I think that there are people celebrating that. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4423.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4425.68s)]
*  So I wonder if these are industry friends. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4426.68s)]
*  Sure. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4431.6s)]
*  That Drake maybe thought that since they had some number one songs together, that, you [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4432.6s)]
*  know, he maybe took them on tour or he had perceived that he was helping them. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4438.240000000001s)]
*  These guys might have perceived like, you know, I'm putting this guy from Canada who's [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4443.4800000000005s)]
*  half white over. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4447.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4448.400000000001s)]
*  Without me, he's not legit. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4449.400000000001s)]
*  I'm doing him the favor. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4450.400000000001s)]
*  Like everybody thinks that they're the one helping everyone. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4451.4s)]
*  Nope. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4454.599999999999s)]
*  Very rarely do people, especially in this like narcissistic business, go, I'm put on [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4455.599999999999s)]
*  by these people. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4460.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4461.92s)]
*  Like, it's very rare. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4462.92s)]
*  No, I do think that there are a lot of people who were only friends with Drake because he [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4464.28s)]
*  was on top and they thought they could get something out of him. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4467.759999999999s)]
*  I think it's happening with more than that. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4470.4s)]
*  No, no, I agree. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4472.48s)]
*  I agree. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4473.759999999999s)]
*  There's more. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4474.759999999999s)]
*  But I guess just the point I'm trying to make is like, every time I see an Instagram post [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4475.759999999999s)]
*  where it's like Drake was the number one artist in hip hop from 2010 years straight or like [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4479.0s)]
*  15 years, something insane, I start going, wow, there's a lot of other rappers that are [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4484.04s)]
*  working really hard and they wanted to have the number one album that year and they want [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4488.400000000001s)]
*  to be the most viewed or the most listened to and they're not. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4492.0s)]
*  And they've been doing that the entirety of their career. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4494.84s)]
*  Some rappers careers blossomed and fell off during Drake's reign. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4497.32s)]
*  So despite them being nice and friendly and still wanting a feature, they're also like, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4502.360000000001s)]
*  man, fuck that dude. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4506.8s)]
*  Think about comedians that were like, man, I'd love to open you open for you. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4509.8s)]
*  But then also open you open you open. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4512.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the best. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4530.96s)]
*  I'm a regular Nazi. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4534.12s)]
*  He called you Nazi just in case you. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4541.12s)]
*  So maybe it isn't people flipping on them. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4544.12s)]
*  It's like maybe this is people showing their true colors. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4545.96s)]
*  Like if you hate on somebody when they're down, this is what Charlamagne said, is like, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4548.36s)]
*  if there's anybody that that agree, like when this whole Kendrick thing was going down, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4552.4s)]
*  he was like, listen, keep note if there's anybody who supports this, if anybody who [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4557.04s)]
*  likes post, there's anybody who comments in support of what's going on. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4562.84s)]
*  Keep in mind, they've been hating the whole time. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4566.52s)]
*  They've been dapping you up at comedy clubs, asking to open for you on tour, saying they're [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4568.6s)]
*  happy for you. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4572.24s)]
*  And the second this shit happens, if they like it, they was hating the whole time. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4573.08s)]
*  So keep note and then just cut those motherfuckers out. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4576.88s)]
*  I saw who was liking posts. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4579.4800000000005s)]
*  We all saw. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4582.4800000000005s)]

*  We got an op list. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4591.5599999999995s)]
*  50 got my op list. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4592.32s)]
*  I got it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4593.32s)]
*  We went over it the other day. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4594.32s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4596.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4597.4s)]
*  Anyway, 50 got to watch out. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4598.4s)]
*  He might be on my list. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4599.599999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4600.599999999999s)]
*  He stole his corner. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4601.599999999999s)]
*  He took his shots at me. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4602.599999999999s)]
*  That was love. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4603.599999999999s)]
*  I know that was fire. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4604.599999999999s)]
*  That was love. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4605.599999999999s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4606.599999999999s)]

*  He was awesome. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4609.599999999999s)]
*  They tried to make fun of his Las Vegas thing. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4610.599999999999s)]
*  He handled that perfectly. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4611.599999999999s)]
*  He immediately, the next show is on stage, sold out, going, they saying I'm supposed to [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4612.599999999999s)]
*  not dance like this. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4616.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not Chris Brown. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4617.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not a slut. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4618.639999999999s)]
*  We'll show you the thing you coming for. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4619.8s)]
*  We'll do this. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4621.8s)]
*  All this. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4622.8s)]
*  Fucking love it. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4623.8s)]
*  One counterpoint. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4624.8s)]
*  Go, go, go, go. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4625.8s)]
*  Joe Rogan has been on top of the game for a decade, whatever. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4626.8s)]
*  I'm sure there are comedians who are jealous, who are whatever, but there are also comedians [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4629.8s)]
*  who will ride for Joe. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4634.8s)]
*  They don't fucking cares. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4636.6s)]
*  A lot of those guys. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4637.76s)]
*  Joe helped them out. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4639.280000000001s)]
*  Joe put us on. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4640.280000000001s)]
*  We'll ride for Joe. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4641.280000000001s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4642.280000000001s)]
*  That doesn't seem to be happening nearly. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4643.4800000000005s)]
*  Because you haven't seen this happen to Joe. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4644.96s)]
*  I mean he had the N word thing. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4647.76s)]
*  The difference is that the media is coming for him. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4649.12s)]
*  That the collectivist mainstream media is going against our guy. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4651.24s)]
*  So everyone rallies. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4655.24s)]
*  If it's another person, then people choose sides. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4656.24s)]
*  And also he's never lost the people. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4659.36s)]
*  He's had the media criticize him, but his people have never flipped. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4663.08s)]
*  It felt like with the Drake situation that the people changed sides. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4667.04s)]
*  The people supported the opposition. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4670.88s)]
*  He's just always been on top. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4673.28s)]
*  But if you don't think that there are not some bitter ass, hateful motherfucking comedians [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4674.88s)]
*  that would love something bad to happen to Joe. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4679.0s)]
*  And they relish every time that they try to cancel that motherfucker. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4681.36s)]
*  Of course there are. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4684.08s)]
*  Of course there are. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4685.56s)]
*  And they fucking behave and play nice and play fucking fake. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4686.56s)]
*  And Joe's smart. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4691.16s)]
*  I bet he knows it all. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4692.16s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4693.16s)]

*  That's why I believe it. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4900.98s)]
*  The fact that she gets to go to work every day and do nothing and she's upset. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4901.98s)]

*  Why are you even talking about her name? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4972.82s)]
*  This has nothing to do with you. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4974.82s)]
*  If you're being sexually harassed, talk about your sexual harassment. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4975.82s)]
*  No, but she said that she opened up to Joy and Joy was like, forget about it. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4979.82s)]
*  This is the call to you. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4985.82s)]
*  Don't say a fucking word. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4986.82s)]
*  So you can't even give good advice to your coworkers? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4987.82s)]
*  You asked me for advice. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4990.82s)]
*  I told you forget about it. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4992.82s)]
*  See what I mean? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4995.82s)]
*  If I'm Joy Taylor and I'm fucking my way to the top and this girl gets 1.5 million just [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=4996.82s)]
*  from fucking. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5000.82s)]
*  For not fucking. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5001.82s)]
*  Joy Taylor got to fuck and then come to work. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5002.82s)]
*  This massage artist is going to. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5006.82s)]
*  Allegedly, she got to fuck incredibly famous, successful, talented people in her field. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5008.82s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5016.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5018.82s)]
*  Imagine you dedicate your life to sports and media and you are around talented, successful [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5019.82s)]
*  people in sports and media that you also find attractive. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5024.82s)]
*  You will not have sex with them. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5027.82s)]
*  What do you think about this part though? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5029.82s)]
*  She told the hairstylist if something. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5030.82s)]
*  He's thinking he's looking in your head. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5033.82s)]
*  He's in your head right now. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5035.82s)]
*  He already knows what you're going to say. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5037.82s)]
*  Go, go, go, go, go. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5039.82s)]
*  If they try to fire her. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5040.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5042.82s)]
*  Then she's going to say, oh, that executive. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5043.82s)]
*  That's what's called a joke. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5045.82s)]
*  This massage stylist don't know a single thing about jokes. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5049.82s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5052.82s)]
*  That's a joke. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5053.82s)]
*  She's using me too as a joke like funny podcasters. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5054.82s)]
*  She's involved in media. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5058.82s)]
*  This girl's amazing. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5060.82s)]
*  Tell me you don't want to have someone like that in the office. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5061.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's a morale hire. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5064.82s)]
*  For sure. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5066.82s)]
*  Just get the vibe. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5067.82s)]
*  Talented, beautiful, likes dicks. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5068.82s)]
*  A little expensive. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5070.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no, not. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5071.82s)]
*  She's not expensive. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5073.82s)]
*  She's going to work for it. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5074.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5075.82s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is you can't fuck people. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5076.82s)]
*  Then after fucking them, you build a relationship and they're like, holy shit, not only can she fuck it, she's like really talented. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5078.82s)]
*  She should go on all these shows. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5082.82s)]
*  I don't understand what's wrong. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5084.82s)]
*  Every restaurant that you work in, everybody in the restaurant fucks. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5086.82s)]
*  Every single restaurant, everyone in the restaurant fucks. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5089.82s)]
*  Every business, everyone fucks. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5092.82s)]
*  We don't hire women. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5094.82s)]
*  We don't hire. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5096.82s)]
*  We got one woman here in the what's the rule. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5098.82s)]
*  It's two million. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5100.82s)]
*  That's smart. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5102.82s)]
*  Just price it out. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5106.82s)]
*  Just price it out. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5107.82s)]
*  It's two million and it's going up every year. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5108.82s)]
*  If we get the zen deal, that shit going up to five. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5110.82s)]
*  No, but I'm just saying like people that work together can't have sex. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5113.82s)]
*  Like what world do we live in where you're going to spend 60 hours a week with somebody that you share the same passions and goals with. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5120.82s)]
*  You're both attractive. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5126.82s)]
*  You're former athletes. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5128.82s)]
*  You've got testosterone coursing through the veins. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5129.82s)]
*  Shane is sharp, not supposed to mop that up. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5131.82s)]
*  Apparently he didn't though. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5133.82s)]
*  Apparently Skip Bayless got jealous because he thought hairstylist was fucking Shannon. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5135.82s)]
*  And that is I think where the animosity started between Skip and Shannon. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5140.82s)]
*  Remember when Skip just started taking shots at Shannon for no reason? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5144.82s)]
*  No, he said Shannon was smashing Joy I thought. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5146.82s)]
*  Joy maybe but not hairstylist. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5148.82s)]
*  I'm not talking about the massage therapist. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5150.82s)]
*  I'm talking about Joy. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5152.82s)]
*  It was the best content ever also when they were going back and forth. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5155.82s)]
*  So in a way she contributed to the show. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5159.82s)]
*  How can you not hire this? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5161.82s)]
*  Joy if they fire you, you're hired. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5162.82s)]
*  Wait, where is she going to sit? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5165.82s)]
*  Why would you even ask that? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5168.82s)]
*  Are you faithful ass motherfucker? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5172.82s)]
*  Are you unfaithful? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5176.82s)]
*  Is she going to say Dubster? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5178.82s)]
*  Is she going to say over there? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5180.82s)]
*  No sir. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5182.82s)]
*  Where is she going to sit? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5183.82s)]
*  His wife recovered. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5185.82s)]
*  This guy is crazy. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5187.82s)]
*  No, I don't need that. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5189.82s)]
*  I don't need that. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5191.82s)]
*  I'm trying to learn to love a piece so he can flirt with bitches. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5192.82s)]
*  See? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5195.82s)]
*  I said that sir. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5197.82s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5199.82s)]
*  Give me his end. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5200.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5201.82s)]
*  This is a little bit. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5203.82s)]
*  I mean am I off on this? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5204.82s)]
*  You cannot use this as a form of power. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5206.82s)]
*  Technically you're off. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5208.82s)]
*  But your logic is fine. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5209.82s)]
*  Okay, using it as a form of power, wrong. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5210.82s)]
*  You can't Weinstein that shit. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5212.82s)]
*  Right? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5213.82s)]
*  There's no Weinstein. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5214.82s)]
*  We're not doing Weinstein over here. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5215.82s)]
*  We're not saying if you don't do this you're not going to get that. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5216.82s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5218.82s)]
*  I don't think there's two people at work hooking up with no leverage, use of leverage at all. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5219.82s)]
*  I don't think should be wrong. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5226.82s)]
*  I get that. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5227.82s)]
*  You got to discuss with HR. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5228.82s)]
*  You got to tell HR about it. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5229.82s)]
*  I'm supposed to tell it. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5230.82s)]
*  Yo, I'm trying to fuck. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5231.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5232.82s)]
*  Yo, by the way, I'm trying to fuck Janice, yo. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5233.82s)]
*  That's the only way? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5235.82s)]
*  No, you and Janice both got to go to HR and be like, hey, we're. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5236.82s)]
*  Okay, so Skip should have been like, yo, HR, I'm about to offer a 1.5. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5239.82s)]
*  That's why it's wrong. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5243.82s)]
*  That's why it's wrong. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5244.82s)]
*  You fuck. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5245.82s)]

*  I don't understand. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5248.82s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5250.82s)]
*  Yo, it's good we don't got no women here. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5251.82s)]

*  It's good. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5254.82s)]
*  I would never offer. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5255.82s)]
*  You can just continue not understanding because you'll never have that problem. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5256.82s)]
*  He's too cheap. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5259.82s)]
*  No, I'm never hooked up with someone I work with. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5262.82s)]

*  I don't think I have. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5273.82s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5274.82s)]
*  You work for yourself as you're 22. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5275.82s)]
*  You work for the pizza place. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5276.82s)]
*  No, my friend Alessandro's older sister used to sit on my hard fucking prepubescent dick. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5277.82s)]
*  At the pizza place. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5282.82s)]
*  At the pizza place. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5283.82s)]
*  I was like 13 or 12 and my dick would get so hard and I'd throw that shit up on my belly [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5284.82s)]
*  and she would just sit on that shit and grind up on it. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5288.82s)]
*  And she was like 17. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5291.82s)]
*  Spun the pizzas on it? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5292.82s)]
*  I would, bro. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5293.82s)]
*  Deadass, I could do that. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5294.82s)]
*  Deadass, I could do that. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5295.82s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5296.82s)]
*  I don't think I've ever had erections like that since. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5297.82s)]
*  He's in his sauce ladle. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5298.82s)]
*  But for real, for real. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5299.82s)]
*  So that was her doing something consensual with me. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5301.82s)]
*  When you were slinging lemonade wearing you elephant walk into meals and shit like that. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5304.82s)]
*  That feels mildly racist. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5309.82s)]
*  That feels racist. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5311.82s)]
*  There's no racism about that. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5312.82s)]
*  I just learned elephant walk from these weirdos the other day. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5314.82s)]
*  That felt mildly racist right there. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5317.82s)]
*  And you want to walk him like this? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5320.82s)]
*  You put his dick over your shoulder. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5322.82s)]
*  And you carry it like you got back from a hunt or something. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5324.82s)]
*  I hope. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5327.82s)]
*  Like it's a pickaxe. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5329.82s)]
*  Bro, come on, man. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5331.82s)]
*  I don't see the issue. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5333.82s)]
*  You also worked in your parents' dance studio for a while. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5335.82s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't fuck any of them. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5337.82s)]
*  So that is the problem with working in a family business. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5339.82s)]
*  You can't get no pussy in a family business, bro. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5344.82s)]
*  Who else was supposed to fuck? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5347.82s)]
*  Like for real, just me, my mom, dad, and Greg all sitting around like, well yeah, they fucking. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5349.82s)]
*  My family is, bro. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5355.82s)]
*  So hire somebody. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5357.82s)]
*  Can y'all hire out? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5358.82s)]
*  Can you hire someone else besides a Schultz in here, please? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5360.82s)]
*  You went from that to working for yourself, bro. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5367.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5369.82s)]
*  You didn't have the opp. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5370.82s)]
*  But if you did, you had to go to HR. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5372.82s)]
*  You had to disclose it with them. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5374.82s)]
*  But I can't go there unless she's willing to do it. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5375.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5378.82s)]
*  You could just be ragging. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5379.82s)]
*  You could just be ragging. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5381.82s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5383.82s)]
*  I truly don't get it. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5385.82s)]
*  But I see his point because how are you going to bring her there if you can't even talk to her about it? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5386.82s)]
*  You and I got to talk to HR about something that you don't know about. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5389.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5392.82s)]
*  The second you talk to her, it's wrong. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5393.82s)]
*  The second you offer the massage psychiatrist something, it's wrong. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5394.82s)]
*  You got to be like, hey, meet me in the HR office. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5400.82s)]
*  And then when you get in there, be like, yo, so what you doing lately? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5402.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5405.82s)]
*  And now you just thrust this upon her. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5406.82s)]
*  Like, I feel like that's even worse than hugging her from behind. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5408.82s)]
*  Big hug. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5415.82s)]
*  I mean, I'm being 100% serious here. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5416.82s)]
*  If you're using his leverage wrong, if you're saying if you don't do this, you're fired wrong. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5418.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5421.82s)]
*  I don't think if you have a relationship with somebody and then you realize that they're talented that you can't give them another job. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5422.82s)]
*  I don't think that's wrong at all. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5428.82s)]
*  Why is that wrong? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5430.82s)]
*  So I'm supposed to keep you down despite your talent just because you give me head a lot. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5431.82s)]
*  That seems like sexism the other way. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5438.82s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5441.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5442.82s)]
*  Because then she's just sucking dick for nothing. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5443.82s)]
*  She's sucking dick for nothing. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5444.82s)]
*  But her sucking dick and her being good at her job have nothing to do with each other. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5447.82s)]
*  Virtually nothing. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5450.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5451.82s)]
*  No one thought Joy Taylor fucked her way to the top before this bombshell report came out. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5454.82s)]
*  That's because we didn't watch FX1. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5458.82s)]
*  I have no idea if she's good at her job or not. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5460.82s)]
*  That is true. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5462.82s)]
*  Damn. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5463.82s)]
*  I have no clue. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5464.82s)]
*  Damn. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5465.82s)]
*  Have you done research? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5466.82s)]
*  No. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5468.82s)]
*  No, I wish there was more research out there to be honest. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5469.82s)]
*  No, but you got to watch women talk about sports in order to know if she's good. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5472.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5477.82s)]
*  And I feel like that's too big a risk. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5478.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5480.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5482.82s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5483.82s)]
*  I felt like an unnecessary jab. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5484.82s)]
*  She's probably good at it. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5488.82s)]
*  I don't know why I even said it. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5489.82s)]
*  Yeah, take it back. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5490.82s)]
*  I take it back. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5491.82s)]
*  That was sexist. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5492.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5493.82s)]
*  Doing necessary jobs. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5494.82s)]
*  Doing necessary jobs? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5495.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5496.82s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5497.82s)]
*  Son, in Trump's America, you pussy. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5498.82s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5500.82s)]
*  I feel a little bit. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5502.82s)]
*  I feel a little bit. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5503.82s)]
*  Now, talking to you guys, I don't know what to think because I'm so peculiar. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5505.82s)]
*  I'm truly baffled. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5510.82s)]
*  I don't understand what you think is appropriate or inappropriate. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5513.82s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5517.82s)]
*  I truly don't get it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5518.82s)]
*  To defend Schultz in 1990, 20% of people met their significant other through work. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5519.82s)]
*  If Miles is trying to fuck somebody, he's actually... [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5525.82s)]
*  David, watch out, David! [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5527.82s)]
*  It's obviously Mark. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5529.82s)]
*  Watch out! [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5530.82s)]
*  I'm married. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5531.82s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5532.82s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5533.82s)]
*  No, I mean, maybe... [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5534.82s)]
*  That's why you wouldn't. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5535.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm faithful. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5536.82s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5537.82s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5538.82s)]
*  No, you are definitely wrong. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5539.82s)]
*  We can't be like this guy. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5540.82s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5541.82s)]
*  I said the power thing is bad. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5542.82s)]
*  Can't do it. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5543.82s)]
*  Power just fucking is fine. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5544.82s)]
*  I feel like that's the majority of how people feel. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5545.82s)]
*  If you're on the same level. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5546.82s)]
*  I feel like that's the majority of how people feel. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5547.82s)]
*  If you're on the same level. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5548.82s)]
*  I feel like that's the majority of how people feel. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5549.82s)]
*  I feel like that's the majority of how people feel. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5550.82s)]
*  What girl wants a fucking guy on the same... [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5556.82s)]
*  I think the issue with her is... [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5557.82s)]
*  Don't they... [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5559.82s)]
*  They're attracted to, you know, more or less. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5560.82s)]
*  I think she's basically fucking dude that she knows can give her the job that she wants exclusively. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5562.82s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5566.82s)]
*  And she's married. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5567.82s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5568.82s)]
*  Also, that she's married. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5569.82s)]
*  She's married. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5570.82s)]
*  Yeah, so hairdresser, hair therapist would be with her before they got full-time jobs there. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5571.82s)]
*  And then Joy would just be there with the executive vice president of FS1 while she's married. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5577.82s)]
*  And then clearly there's a vibe going on. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5582.82s)]
*  And then every time this guy's showing up. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5584.82s)]
*  And then she gets the jobs that probably could have gone to more qualified people. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5585.82s)]
*  Because she didn't have much experience. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5589.82s)]
*  And they were looking for a woman with a lot of sports experience. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5591.82s)]
*  Experience in TV, at least. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5593.82s)]
*  And she didn't really have much of that. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5596.82s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't know for a fact that the other people that they were looking at... [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5597.82s)]
*  I just feel bad for these women that are talented and not able to fuck the people that share their passions. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5599.82s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5606.82s)]
*  If I had a pussy, I'd sleep my way to the top. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5608.82s)]
*  Yeah, big fucking surprise there. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5610.82s)]
*  Who didn't think you would? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5612.82s)]
*  So why can we blame them for that? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5613.82s)]
*  It's also you're not even sleeping your way to the top. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5615.82s)]
*  You're sleeping with people you admire and share the same passions. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5617.82s)]
*  Would you sleep your way to the top? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5620.82s)]
*  Say again? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5621.82s)]
*  If you had a pussy, would you sleep your way to the top? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5622.82s)]
*  Nah, she's gay. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5623.82s)]
*  She's super gay. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5624.82s)]
*  And we only blame the men. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5625.82s)]
*  This is actually better. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5626.82s)]
*  We only blame the men. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5627.82s)]
*  He thinking about it. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5628.82s)]
*  Now we blame the women, too. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5629.82s)]
*  He thinking about it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5630.82s)]
*  I mean, who's on top? [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5631.82s)]
*  That's another question. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5632.82s)]
*  Who's the top of the network? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5633.82s)]
*  Is it Tom Brady? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5634.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5635.82s)]
*  If it's Mark Zuckerberg now, you'd probably try to fuck your way to the top now. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5636.82s)]
*  Shut up, little fuckboy Mark Zuckerberg, bro. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5639.82s)]
*  I like this motherfucker now. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5642.82s)]

*  The rebrand has been crazy. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5644.82s)]
*  The rebrand is amazing. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5645.82s)]
*  We've got to talk to whoever his publicist is. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5646.82s)]
*  We had talked to Zuckerberg's, was it publicist that would do that rebrand? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5647.82s)]
*  I guess. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5648.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5649.82s)]
*  It's almost like he had the black girl glow up. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5650.82s)]
*  It's almost like that. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5651.82s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5652.82s)]
*  Let's be careful with those jokes right there, dude. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5653.82s)]
*  Be careful with those jokes. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5654.82s)]
*  We wouldn't want the internet to go crazy. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5655.82s)]

*  Nah, we got to figure that out. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5688.82s)]
*  That sunscreen picture I think changed a lot for him. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5689.82s)]
*  I think he went home after that vacation and was like, I got to, who am I? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5691.82s)]
*  He looked himself in the mirror and was like, I don't even recognize myself. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5694.82s)]
*  And he's got all the data too. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5697.82s)]

*  Remember when I told you I spoke fluent Latin, you believe me? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5724.82s)]
*  No, I never believed that. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5727.82s)]
*  This motherfucker believes anything. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5729.82s)]
*  I slightly believed that. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5731.82s)]
*  I told him I was part lizard when we first met. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5732.82s)]

*  You keep saying it was good. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5822.0599999999995s)]
*  That shit was far. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5823.0599999999995s)]
*  Did you watch it? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5824.0599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5825.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm shocked you didn't watch it. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5826.0599999999995s)]
*  Most people I know said it wasn't good. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5827.0599999999995s)]
*  I was enjoying my vacation. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5828.0599999999995s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5829.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a trans storyline in this season, okay? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5830.94s)]
*  So immediately when there's trans in anything, I think we're like a little bit sensitive [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5837.02s)]
*  to the DEI forced shit. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5841.620000000001s)]
*  Like when we were growing up, every cartoon was diverse. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5844.06s)]
*  Like when Mulan came out, I wasn't like, oh, here comes the Asian thing. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5846.860000000001s)]
*  Captain Planet? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5849.740000000001s)]
*  Captain Planet. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5850.740000000001s)]
*  Like I was like, oh, every race got to be. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5851.740000000001s)]
*  But now because of DEI rhetoric, when we see it, and because Hollywood trying to force [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5853.740000000001s)]
*  it down, like, oh, let's have black Superman or let's have woman super whatever the fuck [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5859.38s)]
*  it is. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5863.18s)]
*  I think we're very sensitive to it. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5865.02s)]
*  So there's a certain part of the internet that if there's a trans in anything, they're [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5866.62s)]
*  like, oh, fuck this. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5870.94s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5871.94s)]
*  So I think a lot of the Twitter rhetoric about it was like, this is bad just because. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5872.94s)]
*  But they didn't watch it because if you watch it, they actually treat the trans story in [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5877.62s)]
*  the most real I've ever seen. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5881.66s)]
*  Like there's an old lady on the show who's just looking at the trans the whole time like, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5883.26s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5887.38s)]
*  So there's even a point where the trans character is badass and earns the respect. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5889.78s)]
*  And there's one of the younger girls on the show that like sees her after the trans character [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5896.82s)]
*  tells her story. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5900.38s)]
*  And she goes, well, I think you're beautiful. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5901.900000000001s)]
*  And this is the moment where like Hollywood just be like, because it's one on the inside [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5904.34s)]
*  that counts. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5908.58s)]
*  The little girl character goes, I think you're beautiful. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5909.58s)]
*  And the old lady character goes, I'm gonna keep it a buck with you. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5912.34s)]
*  I can't see it yet. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5916.02s)]
*  But I think you're cool. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5917.02s)]
*  It was like they actually had a real reaction to a trans person in the world. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5921.02s)]
*  Like you proved that you're a good person and you're kind and like you're dealing with [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5926.9400000000005s)]
*  your shit. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5930.660000000001s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5931.660000000001s)]
*  But I'm not gonna sit here and lie and be like, you know, you're the most beautiful [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5932.660000000001s)]
*  woman I've ever seen. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5933.660000000001s)]
*  You know, it was like, I thought it was the trans shit handled the best in any like major [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5934.660000000001s)]
*  piece of content that I've seen. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5940.22s)]
*  And the story is just amazing. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5942.9800000000005s)]
*  And the guy, the guy who directs this shit, his ability to like build tension and keep [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5944.14s)]
*  you in the edge of your seat and continuing leveling up and leveling up. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5949.18s)]
*  It's like every actor is incredible. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5952.58s)]
*  Is it just the same shit? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5954.9400000000005s)]
*  They go through all the same games? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5955.9400000000005s)]
*  They do. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5957.34s)]
*  It's very creative. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5958.42s)]
*  It's very creative how they get you back into the game. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5960.9400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't feel forced. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5963.780000000001s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5965.54s)]
*  And I will say this, the dubbing now remember when dubbing used to be like their mouths [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5967.660000000001s)]
*  were still moving even though you couldn't hear some shit. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5972.820000000001s)]
*  They got dubbing down. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5975.38s)]
*  I watch it in English. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5977.3s)]
*  Like I watched with English, not subtitles, dub. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5980.14s)]
*  And I don't notice a difference now. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5984.14s)]
*  Like it's, they figured out dubbing. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5986.66s)]
*  I don't know if they're using AI to move the mouth or something like that. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5988.62s)]
*  But like you could tell it's a little off. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5991.06s)]
*  But what I did, I started with the Korean and then once I kind of understood what the [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5993.34s)]
*  characters were, I go to English and it's just easier to watch. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=5998.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6001.7s)]
*  Because, you know, sometimes you're looking at your phone, you're looking at something [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6002.7s)]
*  that when your subtitles on, you got to fucking stare and read the whole time. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6003.7s)]
*  I'm telling you, I thought it was fucking phenomenal. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6007.26s)]
*  And I think that this guy, the guy who writes and directs it, I think he's like a true genius. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6009.740000000001s)]
*  Like genius. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6014.1s)]
*  And I know I'm building it up so everybody's going to watch it with the highest expectations. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6015.1s)]
*  It's not going to meet that. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6017.820000000001s)]
*  But I mean, just the first, I think it's even like the first or the second episode, there's [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6019.5s)]
*  like a moment where you just, you're sitting at the edge of the seat, you're like, what [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6024.06s)]
*  the fuck is this guy doing to me? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6027.9400000000005s)]
*  Like truly phenomenal. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6029.5s)]
*  Do you think that this was a good time for them to drop it? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6030.5s)]
*  Because I don't hear people talking about it. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6033.18s)]
*  It's interesting you say that. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6035.94s)]
*  I think there's just so much going on. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6037.58s)]
*  And also we're on vacation. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6039.099999999999s)]
*  I think, I think this is like a privilege to say, but like, I think when you're on vacation, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6040.099999999999s)]
*  you think everyone is, like the majority of people aren't right there, like at home for [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6044.5s)]
*  the holidays, they're hanging out, they're still, they're going to work on the 26th. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6048.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6053.139999999999s)]
*  Like they, and everybody else is doing other shit, so they need distraction. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6054.139999999999s)]
*  So apparently the one time during the year where shows get more views than normal on [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6056.719999999999s)]
*  Netflix is the holidays. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6062.419999999999s)]
*  Like Christmas is- [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6064.299999999999s)]
*  But how come podcasts are usually down? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6065.299999999999s)]
*  Because that's work. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6067.82s)]
*  Oh, people listen to it at work. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6068.82s)]
*  Yeah, you listen or watch it work on podcasts. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6071.179999999999s)]
*  And then when it comes to like TV shows or films, when you're not working, you have nothing [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6073.74s)]
*  to do and you're like, I got to just indulge in blasters. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6079.78s)]
*  Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6082.219999999999s)]
*  I mean with the fam and stuff, like my whole family watched Wicked five times. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6083.219999999999s)]
*  Like over the break. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6086.66s)]
*  That I seen. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6088.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, thoughts. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6089.0199999999995s)]
*  So I like, it was good. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6090.0199999999995s)]
*  It was good. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6091.0199999999995s)]
*  Isn't it? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6092.0199999999995s)]
*  But directorally, like the world that was built. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6093.820000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, it was fascinating. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6096.580000000001s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6097.580000000001s)]

*  Like on Amazon or something? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6120.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6121.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6123.46s)]
*  Anyway, I would check out Ask Good Game. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6124.46s)]
*  Koreans are good, bro. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6127.74s)]
*  Koreans are nice. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6129.34s)]
*  I think they're the most American Asians. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6130.34s)]
*  Like culturally, I feel the most similar to them. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6133.9s)]
*  And I guess we don't get a lot of like Chinese culture. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6136.78s)]
*  Because they're right next to communism. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6138.86s)]
*  So it makes sense to be the most capitalistic. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6140.42s)]
*  That they're like rejecting it. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6141.98s)]
*  You're saying? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6142.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6143.98s)]
*  I just even like what they're into. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6144.98s)]
*  The way that they're, yeah, just, I don't know. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6145.98s)]
*  I just have always felt this like closeness with Korean culture. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6148.3s)]
*  But we got to go to Korea. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6151.66s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6152.66s)]
*  Right? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6153.66s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6154.66s)]
*  Go to Seoul. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6155.66s)]
*  Kettle of Vibe. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6156.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, we got to go up to the fucking DMZ and just put the Seoul. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6157.66s)]
*  Right? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6159.86s)]
*  If you're up there, you got to just tap it. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6160.86s)]
*  What are the rules on that? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6163.42s)]
*  I feel like Trump could get us into North Korea. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6165.38s)]
*  Just check it out. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6167.38s)]
*  Oh, that's a like. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6168.38s)]
*  You could get into North Korea. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6169.38s)]
*  Go through China. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6170.38s)]
*  I might sit that one out. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6171.38s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6172.38s)]
*  Don't get arrested in Sweden. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6173.38s)]
*  Don't get arrested in North Korea. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6174.38s)]
*  Just talk about a bouncer. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6175.38s)]
*  Just go, just sit down. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6176.38s)]
*  Get us here to fuck our women. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6177.38s)]
*  Get to here. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6178.38s)]
*  No, it'd be kind of cool. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6180.26s)]
*  Would you go to North Korea if you had a chance? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6184.14s)]
*  No, I have no interest. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6185.46s)]
*  I got a kid now. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6186.46s)]
*  I can't play with that shit. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6187.74s)]
*  I don't even got a kid and I don't want to be doing no shit. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6188.74s)]
*  When I was younger and I didn't have that responsibility, I would absolutely do it. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6192.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6197.14s)]
*  But now I'm like, something could happen. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6198.14s)]
*  I could take a picture of some shit or I could call home and they're like, oh, what are you [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6201.14s)]
*  actually doing? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6204.26s)]
*  Are you a terrorist? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6205.26s)]
*  And now I feel like an asshole because America is using resources to get me back when they [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6206.9s)]
*  could be using resources to like fucking blow up Browns and get their oil that's ours. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6210.86s)]
*  Get our oil back. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6217.62s)]
*  Yeah, get our oil. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6218.62s)]
*  Get our oil. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6219.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6220.62s)]
*  Why do they have our oil? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6221.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6222.62s)]
*  Why did they put it there? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6223.62s)]
*  What the fuck do they have our oil for? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6224.62s)]
*  Why did your God put it there? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6225.62s)]
*  It's probably your God. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6227.62s)]
*  Might have been, probably. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6229.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe that's what happens when you fuck mud and you cum in it. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6231.299999999999s)]
*  Years later it turns into oil. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6234.299999999999s)]
*  Then y'all need to get on it, broke ass Americans. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6235.7s)]
*  Yeah, you fucking right about that. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6237.9s)]
*  Does India have oil? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6239.26s)]
*  No. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6240.26s)]
*  Why would it not? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6241.26s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6242.26s)]
*  Landmass is close, right? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6243.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good ask. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6244.26s)]
*  It's close enough. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6245.26s)]
*  But like oil stops in Iran? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6246.26s)]
*  I don't buy that at all. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6248.42s)]
*  I mean, what is oil? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6250.42s)]
*  Is it dinosaur bones or something? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6251.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6252.42s)]
*  See, I just didn't have dinosaurs. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6253.42s)]
*  Just... [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6256.42s)]
*  13% of the country's supply needs came from Indian oil. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6257.42s)]
*  It's not that much, it seems. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6260.3s)]
*  What's that? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6262.34s)]
*  13% of what? [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6263.34s)]
*  Of India's supply. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6264.34s)]
*  But it just feels peculiar that you guys wouldn't have it. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6265.9800000000005s)]
*  Maybe the mountain range is fucked up. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6269.22s)]
*  I was about to say that. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6270.46s)]
*  Them dinosaurs just didn't migrate there for whatever reason. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6272.3s)]
*  You're not going to climb Everest. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6274.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6275.82s)]
*  No. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6276.82s)]
*  Why is it weak? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6277.82s)]
*  Why is that funny? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6278.82s)]
*  Because it's never... [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6279.82s)]
*  There's this huge mountain range that is in between... [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6280.82s)]
*  Himalayas, yeah. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6285.58s)]
*  But what is it in between? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6286.58s)]
*  China and India. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6287.58s)]
*  China and India, right? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6288.58s)]
*  And then you have Nepal in the middle. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6289.58s)]
*  But China's above India, I thought. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6290.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6293.58s)]
*  Mongolia is between it? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6294.82s)]
*  No, Mongolia is above China. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6295.82s)]
*  Nepal is where the Himalayas are. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6296.82s)]
*  So it is Nepal, but yeah, that doesn't make sense why Westward... [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6298.98s)]
*  Because if the mountains are here, why is it Westward that should... [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6303.18s)]
*  It would be... [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6305.54s)]
*  If it were here, it would make sense to stop the oil. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6306.54s)]
*  That's what we're trying to say. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6308.34s)]
*  Odd, right? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6309.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6310.34s)]
*  Well, I'm going to find out. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6311.34s)]
*  It might just be the production. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6313.34s)]
*  It seems like there might be oil. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6315.34s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6316.34s)]
*  It's like there's probably so many people in India, you can't displace that many of [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6317.34s)]
*  them to just dig and hope that there's some oil. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6320.78s)]
*  You think you would just without a question? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6323.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think we would. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6324.9400000000005s)]
*  I feel like England would have figured it out. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6325.9400000000005s)]
*  True that. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6327.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6328.9400000000005s)]
*  I feel like England would have locked that in. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6329.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you have a theory on why Trudeau stepped down? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6331.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6334.9400000000005s)]
*  Can't wait to hear it. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6335.9400000000005s)]
*  Soon as you think of it. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6338.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, he didn't have a choice, right? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6339.9400000000005s)]
*  He was about to get voted down. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6344.26s)]
*  Oh, is that what it was? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6345.26s)]
*  Isn't that how the system works? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6347.02s)]
*  Like the party is the one that chooses the president if the party loses or the prime [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6348.02s)]
*  minister if the party loses. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6351.7s)]
*  How long was he in power? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6352.7s)]
*  It feels like he was in power for a long time. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6353.7s)]
*  He was like eight years. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6354.7s)]
*  Ten. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6355.7s)]
*  Nine years. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6356.7s)]
*  I don't think they have term limits over there. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6357.7s)]
*  Nine years? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6358.7s)]
*  That's too long, Doug. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6359.7s)]
*  You wore out your welcome. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6360.7s)]
*  I saw everybody flip on him in the last two years, but I think it's just too long. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6361.7s)]
*  Also, he sucked. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6366.7s)]
*  He was a cock in the Canadian economy with shit, like the Canadian dollars and the fucking [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6367.7s)]
*  tubes. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6373.5s)]
*  You can't exactly maintain your power while people's money is evaporating in front of [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6374.5s)]
*  them. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6379.38s)]
*  So they stopped caring about these issues that he pretends to care about once the Canadian [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6380.86s)]
*  dollars lose 20, 30 percent. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6385.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6386.78s)]
*  Do you think he stays in Canada? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6387.78s)]
*  Cuba. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6388.78s)]
*  You think he goes back to Papua? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6389.78s)]
*  He's going home. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6391.78s)]
*  He's going to daddy? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6392.78s)]
*  He's going home. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6393.78s)]
*  Where do you think he goes? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6394.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6395.78s)]
*  I mean, because I forget what it was. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6396.78s)]
*  I was reading about other prime ministers, like when they get ousted or when there's [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6397.78s)]
*  pressure against them to step down, they don't stay. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6401.02s)]
*  It's like they'll go to like London and they live in London or something. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6403.02s)]
*  But I was thinking, if I'm him, if I'm a foreign prime minister, I'd just go to [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6406.82s)]
*  fucking St. Barts or something. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6410.34s)]
*  Yeah, go to France. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6411.900000000001s)]
*  He's going to do that. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6412.900000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6413.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6414.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, also like. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6415.900000000001s)]
*  Speaking a little shitty French, your little Canadian French. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6416.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6419.38s)]
*  Shout out Canada, but it's cold eight months out of the year. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6420.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6422.7s)]
*  So it's like if you have tons of money and you have the ability to live anywhere you want, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6423.7s)]
*  like pop in for the beautiful four months of summer and then the other eight months, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6429.42s)]
*  you're fucking chilling. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6433.14s)]
*  Like. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6434.14s)]
*  But I think Canadians are happy about this. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6436.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6437.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know any Canadians that like Trudeau. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6438.98s)]
*  It's the most peculiar thing because obviously in like the Texas of Canada, like when we're [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6441.5s)]
*  in Alberta, they're like, fuck that guy. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6446.98s)]
*  But then when we're in Toronto, they're like, fuck that guy. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6448.94s)]
*  So I'm like, who says they like the guy? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6452.299999999999s)]
*  I think it flipped post-COVID. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6454.7s)]
*  I think the COVID restrictions were so like so severe that I think that was the beginning [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6456.219999999999s)]
*  of them being like, fuck this guy, because he was like a darling early on. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6460.5599999999995s)]
*  I think in the beginning people were like that. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6462.9s)]
*  They seemed to be young. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6464.58s)]
*  I just hear everybody complaining about the cost of living. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6465.7s)]
*  I think that's what they're all mad about. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6468.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6469.66s)]
*  They're like, yeah. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6470.66s)]
*  I think this is like happening around the world, right? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6471.66s)]
*  It's like there's a rejection of progressivism. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6474.1s)]
*  I think the pendulum swung too far and people are like, all right, what are we doing over [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6476.26s)]
*  here? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6479.34s)]
*  Like. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6480.34s)]
*  Son, that's what Zuckerberg basically said in his little five minute address that came [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6481.34s)]
*  out I guess yesterday when this podcast drops. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6483.74s)]
*  But basically he's like, we're moving Facebook from Cali to Texas, it's gone too far, progressivism [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6486.1s)]
*  is taking over. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6490.82s)]
*  He literally is like, no one cares about that shit anymore. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6491.82s)]
*  We're going to change the way Facebook is. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6494.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6496.3s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6497.3s)]
*  And why Texas? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6499.22s)]
*  Do they give him a deal, you think? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6500.22s)]
*  Of course. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6501.22s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6502.22s)]
*  No state tax probably is big, but Texas will give you the deal. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6503.22s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think it's just that it's too far left wing because he's like, I want [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6505.66s)]
*  to take politics out of it. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6509.860000000001s)]
*  Texas is pretty fucking right. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6511.46s)]
*  Austin, maybe not. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6512.7s)]
*  Austin is not. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6513.7s)]
*  But Texas, yeah. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6515.14s)]
*  I mean, wheels isn't even allowing any abortions. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6517.02s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6519.26s)]
*  It's like no abortions whatsoever. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6520.26s)]
*  None of them? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6521.26s)]
*  Wheels is very strict about this abortion issue. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6522.26s)]
*  There's 17 states of. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6524.34s)]
*  But like it's completely gone. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6525.66s)]
*  It's the most severe in Texas. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6527.5s)]
*  Even the one exception for mother's life being in danger is apparently so kind of vaguely [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6528.98s)]
*  warded that they could theoretically be like, no, that's not a good enough exception. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6533.98s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6538.14s)]
*  No, that's crazy. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6539.14s)]
*  This could be an Akash fact. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6540.14s)]
*  That could be mistaken, but I'm fairly certain that's what it is. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6541.14s)]
*  No, I think you're right. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6543.14s)]
*  I think 17 or 19 states right now have like almost full abortion bans. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6544.14s)]
*  But within a certain amount of time or none at all? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6548.34s)]
*  I think it's none at all. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6551.46s)]
*  Texas is the most severe as far as I remember. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6553.22s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6554.94s)]
*  Research is for the pod. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6555.94s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6557.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, Miles told me that they banned porn in Florida. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6558.379999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6560.379999999999s)]
*  Lil Duval posted a porn screenshot. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6561.379999999999s)]

*  Like basketball players. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6620.259999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you know, I was like... [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6621.259999999999s)]
*  Don't kick it off the top. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6622.259999999999s)]
*  No, you know what I mean? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6623.259999999999s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6624.259999999999s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6625.259999999999s)]
*  Cross over. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6626.259999999999s)]
*  It's a cross. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6627.259999999999s)]
*  They close their head. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6628.259999999999s)]
*  No, they don't. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6629.259999999999s)]
*  Behind the back. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6630.259999999999s)]
*  I'm going to pull a video for you. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6631.259999999999s)]
*  I will. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6632.259999999999s)]
*  All right, say, you were trying to masturbate at home and porn hunted you. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6633.259999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6635.259999999999s)]
*  I had a nocturnal omniscient. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6636.259999999999s)]
*  I didn't need that. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6637.259999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6638.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6639.259999999999s)]
*  So how did you know that porn wasn't working? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6640.259999999999s)]
*  I was reading the New York Times. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6641.7s)]
*  Son. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6642.7s)]
*  You don't read that cuck ass publication. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6643.7s)]
*  I was reading the New York Times. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6646.7s)]
*  Stop it, John. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6647.7s)]
*  I was. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6648.7s)]
*  I was perusing the Daily Perennial. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6649.7s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6651.7s)]
*  And they said there's no more porn hubs. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6652.7s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6654.18s)]
*  You fired up your VPN and you got it going? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6655.18s)]
*  I just looked into it. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6656.780000000001s)]
*  Okay, we got a sponsor. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6657.780000000001s)]
*  I want to support the sponsor. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6658.780000000001s)]
*  I don't want to see if it was really banned. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6659.780000000001s)]
*  Apparently some hotels are running their Wi-Fi through states that don't allow porn hubs [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6661.780000000001s)]
*  so that people are masturbating less in their hotel rooms. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6666.22s)]
*  Why are they trying to stop that? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6668.62s)]
*  Because the owners of four masturbators are cleaning. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6670.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6671.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6672.26s)]
*  Because of people like Al just shoot on the carpet. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6673.26s)]
*  So remember when I told you all I had that nocturnal omniscient? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6677.26s)]
*  So when we were in St. Barts, there was a lady that comes by the house to do the laundry. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6681.26s)]
*  And she just mixed all the underwear. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6685.96s)]
*  And Dove just gave me all his underwear. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6690.34s)]
*  Because he's like, you came in your underwear. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6693.26s)]
*  Even if it's washed, I'm not fucking wearing it. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6695.7s)]
*  Dove left St. Barts with no underwear. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6697.9s)]
*  Because he didn't want to mix it up. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6699.9s)]
*  Because he didn't want the potential mix up of my dick. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6702.9s)]
*  That's valid. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6705.9s)]
*  That's valid, Doug. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6706.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6707.9s)]
*  Is that valid? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6708.9s)]
*  I can see both sides on this one. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6709.9s)]
*  That's valid. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6710.9s)]
*  But he's like icky about that kind of stuff. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6711.9s)]
*  Seeming as icky, Doug. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6713.9s)]
*  Seeming as an icky, icky thing. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6714.9s)]
*  He wasn't going to wear his underwear. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6715.9s)]
*  It was just that it was washed. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6716.9s)]
*  But they have the same underwear? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6717.9s)]
*  They have the same underwear. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6718.9s)]
*  We all have the same underwear. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6719.9s)]
*  We all have the same underwear. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6721.9s)]
*  We're all wearing underwear. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6722.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6723.9s)]
*  But I'm still. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6724.9s)]
*  Nah, if it's washed, it's fresh. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6725.9s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6726.9s)]
*  But now I got another 10 pairs of underwear. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6727.9s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6729.9s)]
*  Because I believe that. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6730.9s)]
*  I believe what you're saying. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6731.9s)]
*  I want to say it's in the same water that you're cleaning with. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6732.9s)]
*  Yeah, he played himself on that one. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6742.9s)]
*  But I would do the same thing. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6743.9s)]
*  That's tough. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6745.9s)]
*  Also, going commando is kind of nice. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6746.9s)]
*  Why are you sleeping with underwear? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6747.9s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6749.9s)]
*  That shit is not uncomfortable? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6750.9s)]
*  That's actually a great point. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6751.9s)]
*  Because you get hard-ons while you're sleeping. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6752.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6754.9s)]
*  It's not uncomfortable? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6755.9s)]
*  Don't say uncomfortable. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6756.9s)]
*  That's so annoying that you say uncomfortable. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6758.9s)]
*  He's saying, oh man, when you get a massive erection, doesn't it pull on the threads and [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6760.9s)]
*  the silk in your underwear and rip it off? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6765.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6766.9s)]
*  Does it happen to everybody? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6767.9s)]
*  It's like Hulk Hogan coming out of his chair. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6768.9s)]
*  That's not everybody. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6769.9s)]
*  You're dicking through it. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6770.9s)]
*  What's up, brother? [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6771.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6772.9s)]
*  Actually, I have my dick hanging out the hole in the underwear when I sleep. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6773.9s)]
*  No. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6779.9s)]
*  No, you don't. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6780.9s)]
*  Wait, y'all sleep with your dick in the hole? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6781.9s)]
*  No, actually, one eye open, just like you, bro. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6784.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6786.9s)]
*  I keep my dick out. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6787.9s)]
*  One eye open. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6788.9s)]
*  I just have my dick hanging out when it gets hard, it gets hard, it goes down. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6789.9s)]
*  Why don't you wear it? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6792.9s)]
*  What if someone tried to finger my ass in the middle of it? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6793.9s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6796.9s)]
*  I got to have that blocked. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6797.9s)]
*  Somebody just came in the sheets when he was knocking on them. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6798.9s)]
*  So you just come in the sheets when you're knocked on an erection? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6800.9s)]
*  That's what he does. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6802.9s)]
*  Then if that's the case, then Dove should have kept his underwear. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6803.9s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, but he didn't believe that I just come in the sheets and all my [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6805.9s)]
*  little fuckhole in the mattress. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6807.9s)]
*  You all got a little fuckhole in the mattress? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6808.9s)]
*  Nah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6813.9s)]
*  Dude. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6814.9s)]
*  Bro, that must be tough for you, man. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6815.9s)]
*  You sleep in commando, right? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6817.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6818.9s)]

*  Wait, you sleep naked every night? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6822.9s)]
*  You don't sleep naked, Mark. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6824.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6826.9s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6827.9s)]
*  You sleep on the ground naked? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6828.9s)]
*  Not on the ground. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6830.9s)]
*  You don't sleep naked. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6831.9s)]
*  I'm telling you, bro, I just fucking military style. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMQ1RfCNxo&t=6834.9s)]
