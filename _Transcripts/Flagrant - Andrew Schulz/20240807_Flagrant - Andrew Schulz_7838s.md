*  What the f***? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=17.84s)]

*  We just said that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=19.92s)]
*  Williamsburg was crazy in the 90s. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=20.72s)]
*  It was just affordable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=22.16s)]

*  I can stop him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=29.28s)]
*  HBO was really worried about Game of Thrones. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=30.96s)]
*  They were just like, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=33.12s)]
*  dragons? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=33.6s)]

*  But they took the risk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=36.08s)]
*  With great risk comes great reward. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=37.52s)]
*  Do you have people in the dwarf community reaching out and saying... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=39.44s)]
*  Listen, bro. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  In the tree hollow? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  I did say where they lived, please! [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=47.84s)]
*  Let me call them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=50.32s)]
*  It's really small. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=51.2s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=54.96s)]
*  Welcome to Flaygrant. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=55.68s)]
*  Today, I am incredibly excited. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=56.48s)]
*  Maybe the most excited I've ever been to do an episode of Flaygrant. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  We have an illustrious guest. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  I think the first time that I met him, I said... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  Season two of a specific show, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=69.28s)]
*  his character was the greatest season that a character has ever had in the history of television. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=71.28s)]
*  I think that's what I said. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=78.08s)]
*  And then he said, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=80.32s)]
*  Can you leave me alone, please? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=81.44s)]
*  And I don't think that second part was true. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=83.44s)]
*  We have Peter Dinklage with us! [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=86.88s)]
*  Let's get him filming! [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=88.24s)]
*  Bum, bum, bum, bum! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=89.44s)]
*  Now, we also have... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=91.36s)]
*  Is that the bear horns, Andrew? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=92.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  Special effects are high here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=95.36s)]
*  We also have Elliot with us, guys. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  Oh, what's up, Elliot? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=98.16s)]
*  The fearless director of Peter's new movie. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=99.52s)]
*  On Andrew Shultz's new film. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  No, no, this is your guy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=106.72s)]
*  We call it a film, not a movie. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=107.52s)]
*  Okay, my bad. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=108.8s)]
*  High brow. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=109.44s)]
*  I need to be high or brow. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=110.56s)]
*  You do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  We can pluck. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Can you teach me how to be more sophisticated when I talk about cinema? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Cinema. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=119.04s)]
*  Franchise me way, it is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=119.92s)]
*  It's rubbing off on me. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Okay, we're very excited to have you because you barely do podcasts, you don't do anything. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't do anything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=126.64s)]
*  Outside of just being part of huge movie franchises and TV shows, sorry, film, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=128.08s)]
*  when researching you, there's like three things on the internet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=135.52s)]
*  You have a Mark Maron. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=139.44s)]
*  You have an address that you gave your college. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=141.12s)]
*  That was a highlight, yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=145.12s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=146.4s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=147.04s)]
*  That's really awesome. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=147.52s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=148.48s)]
*  That was very cool. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=148.8s)]
*  And it was like about 20 years after I graduated, I guess, and the school hasn't lost its beauty. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=149.84s)]
*  And the kids, they look so young. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=158.72s)]
*  We think we're adults at that age and they just look like children. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=161.52s)]
*  That just means we're all old. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=165.44s)]
*  But that's good that you think they look like children because sometimes in Hollywood, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=166.88s)]
*  but you were like, they're too young. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=171.44s)]
*  They're so young. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=173.12s)]
*  Look how young they are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=174.4s)]
*  You're on the right side of history. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=175.2s)]
*  I would never think that I'm there appropriately. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=176.32s)]
*  21, yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=180.72s)]
*  Where is your dorm room? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=182.56s)]
*  Yeah, that was a highlight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=186.0s)]
*  But I do things. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=187.68s)]
*  I do things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I do this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=189.04s)]
*  I do things. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=189.68s)]
*  This is where? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  You gotta do things. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=191.04s)]
*  You gotta sell the cars. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=192.0s)]
*  But the more you do things though, I drink a lot of coffee, you know, you poured the wine, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  you start talking your mouth off, especially with friends, and you just get in trouble. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=199.36s)]
*  So actors should, because it's taken out of context, it's taken and used for somebody else's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  agenda. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=212.56s)]
*  Anything hot button. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=213.28s)]
*  We won't talk about anything hot button. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  You talk about what you have for breakfast. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  That's all we're going to do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=220.24s)]
*  I dare anybody to turn it into their own agenda. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=220.96s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  But they will. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  They will. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  They will. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=225.52s)]
*  Now you did have a good opinion about the Olympic opening ceremony. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=225.84s)]
*  I did not see it, but I heard Gaga was great and Celine. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=234.32s)]

*  because they're not looking for Leo. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=652.58s)]

*  You want to give them a lecture. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=666.58s)]
*  Yeah, but it is a funny thing, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=668.58s)]

*  They're just trying to... [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=685.58s)]
*  They... [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=686.58s)]
*  Again, they mean well, but they're just... [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=687.58s)]
*  We don't know what gender they are. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=689.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=691.58s)]
*  They're just... [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=692.58s)]
*  They're just confused. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=694.58s)]
*  They don't get it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=697.58s)]
*  Also, I think when you watch someone... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=699.58s)]
*  This is different where film is different from television. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=700.58s)]
*  Is it... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=703.58s)]
*  Like, I remember watching The Wire when I was younger, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=704.58s)]
*  and those people were... [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=706.58s)]
*  That was their real life. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=708.58s)]
*  They weren't actors to me. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=709.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=710.58s)]
*  Well, yeah, that show was incredible. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=711.58s)]
*  But I think the same thing happened with Game of Thrones. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=713.58s)]
*  It was like, oh, this is the world that I'm just a voyeur in. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=715.58s)]
*  And then you see somebody just walking their dog [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=719.58s)]
*  or getting coffee, and it's like, yeah, that doesn't make sense at all. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=721.58s)]
*  Weren't you riding a drag? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=724.58s)]
*  And you were also so good in that show. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=725.58s)]
*  And to his point, we spent years getting to know you as Tyrion. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=727.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=731.58s)]
*  It's a familiarity, unlike a movie. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=732.58s)]
*  It's a familiarity. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=733.58s)]
*  Yeah, 90 minutes in a movie room. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=734.58s)]
*  I just have to point out, like, before we met, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=735.58s)]
*  I thought Tyrion was this ingenious character that you concocted. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=737.58s)]
*  And then we hung out one night and partied. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=742.58s)]
*  And I was like, I don't even know if he's acting. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=744.58s)]
*  It's like, this guy is fucking getting after it, dude. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=746.58s)]
*  Like, what happened? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=750.58s)]
*  I almost wanted to read the book and see if you just made him you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=752.58s)]
*  No, it wasn't me. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=756.58s)]
*  Dave and Dan are writers. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=758.58s)]
*  They're so good. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=760.58s)]
*  They're so good. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=762.58s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't watched House of Dragon [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=764.58s)]
*  because I feel like what, I don't know, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=766.58s)]
*  I just spent so many years doing that show. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=768.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little close. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=771.58s)]
*  I'm watching other things now. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=772.58s)]
*  It's maybe one day, but it is wild. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=773.58s)]
*  I miss that show, but it's like I miss the life of it more [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=776.58s)]
*  because it's nine years and it's just such a thing. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=779.58s)]
*  It's such a big chunk of your life, which is rare. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=782.58s)]
*  I will say the difference is, like, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=784.58s)]
*  because I'm obviously a huge fan of Game of Thrones, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=787.58s)]
*  and I've been a fan of House of Dragons, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=788.58s)]
*  is I think what some Hollywood execs thought [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=790.58s)]
*  is the reason people like Game of Thrones is the dragons. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=794.58s)]
*  And I don't think they realized that it was like exquisite writing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=798.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=802.58s)]
*  And it was a... [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=804.58s)]
*  You hear it. It's like I love Breaking Bad [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=806.58s)]
*  because those guys are so good, but you hear that crispy, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=808.58s)]
*  like, Vince Gilligan writing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=810.58s)]
*  You're like, this is how people talk, but it's so elevated. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=812.58s)]
*  Dense. Every sentence. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=817.58s)]
*  And you know, yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=819.58s)]
*  And it's not just like... [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=821.58s)]
*  It's not like you read some scripts and you're like, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=823.58s)]
*  there's so many scenes where it's just somebody asks a question, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=826.58s)]
*  somebody answers it, and it's just so sort of dense. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=829.58s)]
*  Meaningless, yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=831.58s)]
*  That's not how people talk. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=832.58s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean by that? It's not how people talk. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=834.58s)]
*  No, no, that... [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=837.58s)]
*  It's not how people talk in life. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=839.58s)]
*  They talk over each other, they do fits and spurts of poetry, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=841.58s)]
*  and they forget their chain of thought. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=845.58s)]
*  It's a really... [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=847.58s)]
*  So sometimes dialogue is... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=849.58s)]
*  Great writers know that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=851.58s)]
*  It's fucking hard to make it look natural. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=853.58s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=855.58s)]
*  Who was I? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=857.58s)]
*  Oh, John Goodman. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=859.58s)]
*  I heard a... I think it was a podcast. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=861.58s)]
*  There we go. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=863.58s)]
*  John Goodman talking about that, like the Cone Brothers. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=865.58s)]
*  It's so good and so fresh, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=867.58s)]
*  you feel like those guys are just improv-ing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=869.58s)]
*  But no, it's written. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=871.58s)]
*  Every line, they're just faithful to. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=873.58s)]
*  Yeah, and you say breaking bad. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=875.58s)]
*  You go outside the lines and it falls apart, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=877.58s)]
*  if it's a really good script. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=879.58s)]
*  You know? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=881.58s)]
*  The thread, the sweater will become unthreaded [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=883.58s)]
*  and you'll lose it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=885.58s)]
*  But you stick to those lines. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=887.58s)]
*  I remember watching Game of Thrones, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=889.58s)]
*  there were certain lines that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=891.58s)]
*  I remember almost like rap lyrics. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=893.58s)]
*  The chaos is a ladder. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=895.58s)]
*  I drink and I know things. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=897.58s)]
*  Or a t-shirt. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=899.58s)]
*  But they become t-shirts, which obviously [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=901.58s)]
*  we're going to commodify everything. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=903.58s)]
*  Yes, they haven't thought of that before. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=905.58s)]
*  But it's so impactful, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=907.58s)]
*  like, okay, this is it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=909.58s)]
*  That's what I was going to say, like Breaking Bad, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=911.58s)]
*  maybe the best show ever, I love it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=913.58s)]
*  I remember I Am the Danger, I remember that one thing. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=915.58s)]
*  I'm the one who knocks. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=917.58s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=919.58s)]
*  Game of Thrones, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=921.58s)]
*  you get a few of those every season. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=923.58s)]
*  Like a few of those, chaos is a ladder, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=925.58s)]
*  like you said, these things, holy shit, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=927.58s)]
*  that's going to stick. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=929.58s)]
*  I fancy myself a little smart, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=931.58s)]
*  but I was like, oh, God, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=933.58s)]
*  why didn't I put that together? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=935.58s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't even put that in. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=937.58s)]
*  Dude, that is perfection. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=939.58s)]
*  The Life Tour, the last leg, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=941.58s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1071.58s)]
*  I won't give you your money back, probably, but I'll think about it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1073.58s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1075.58s)]
*  When the idea of playing the role comes up, is it... [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1077.58s)]
*  Do you not even care that it's fantasy? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1079.58s)]
*  Are you just looking at it? Were you familiar [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1081.58s)]
*  with the books? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1083.58s)]
*  The genre has nothing to do with it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1085.58s)]
*  Sadly, though, sometimes genre... [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1087.58s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I was raised in the 80s [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1091.58s)]
*  where it was like before [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1093.58s)]
*  Lord of the Rings, you had like [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1095.58s)]
*  just like B-movies. The fantasy was like [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1097.58s)]
*  B-movies. Beastmaster. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1099.58s)]
*  They weren't... [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1101.58s)]
*  They were so expensive to make, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1103.58s)]
*  it's hard to, you know, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1105.58s)]
*  to make it look good. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1107.58s)]
*  No fault of any filmmaker was struggling [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1109.58s)]
*  to make those things. But, you know, then [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1111.58s)]
*  I guess probably I fell in love with sci-fi because of Star Wars [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1113.58s)]
*  and Blade Runner and the ones that were done really well. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1117.58s)]
*  But fantasy was always sort of like, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1121.58s)]
*  really? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1123.58s)]
*  I mean, we had Jim Henson, like Dark Crystal, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1125.58s)]
*  which was really cool when I was a kid, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1127.58s)]
*  but everybody sort of shied away from it, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1129.58s)]
*  because it was a certain thing and it wasn't elevated enough. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1131.58s)]
*  So Star Wars... [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1137.58s)]
*  And they were worried. HBO was really worried about Game of Thrones. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1139.58s)]
*  Yeah, they were like... [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1141.58s)]
*  There was a few people who really believed in it, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1143.58s)]
*  and Dave and Dan especially, in their writing, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1145.58s)]
*  but because of that, I think, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1147.58s)]
*  they were just like, dragons? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1149.58s)]
*  We do like The Wire and Supremacy. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1151.58s)]
*  Yeah, we break from... [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1153.58s)]
*  That's so not what... [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1155.58s)]
*  But it was mafia. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1157.58s)]
*  And with great risk comes great reward. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1159.58s)]
*  And every day. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1163.58s)]
*  And I wish people did it more, because [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1165.58s)]
*  then we have knockoffs and sequels, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1167.58s)]
*  and it's like, I'm missing that risk. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1169.58s)]
*  So you think that's what's happening right now with film? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1171.58s)]
*  Yeah, oh my God. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1175.58s)]
*  There's a concern about risk. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1177.58s)]
*  Yes, but I think [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1179.58s)]
*  being inundated by all these remakes and stuff [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1181.58s)]
*  that are sort of flopping at the box office, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1183.58s)]
*  they just are like... [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1185.58s)]
*  But aren't you learning a lesson because of that? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1187.58s)]
*  No. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1189.58s)]
*  It's really hard, and I wouldn't begin to know how to run a studio, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1191.58s)]
*  but I think [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1193.58s)]
*  you've already spent some money [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1195.58s)]
*  developing these scripts, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1197.58s)]
*  we're already at the gate. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1199.58s)]
*  Just un-watch the gate, let us run, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1201.58s)]
*  and if we mess up, we mess up, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1203.58s)]
*  but we might not, and it might be great. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1205.58s)]
*  But I just don't understand. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1207.58s)]
*  That reasoning. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1209.58s)]
*  I was talking to a guy [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1211.58s)]
*  who's in the business, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1213.58s)]
*  and he was saying [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1215.58s)]
*  that the studio model is [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1217.58s)]
*  there's a guy who works there who might be in love with film. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1219.58s)]
*  He truly might love it, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1221.58s)]
*  and that's why he ended up getting the job, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1223.58s)]
*  but his job is to put out eight movies a year. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1225.58s)]
*  That's the job. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1227.58s)]
*  A quota. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1229.58s)]
*  And whenever you have a quota, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1231.58s)]
*  like if you're a cop with a quota, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1233.58s)]
*  you're going to arrest some... [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1235.58s)]
*  My wife pointed out. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1237.58s)]
*  My wife? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1239.58s)]
*  I was pointing... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1241.58s)]
*  You look like a burnout. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1243.58s)]
*  We should be the... [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1245.58s)]
*  go on the dating game. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1247.58s)]
*  Bachelor number one. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1249.58s)]
*  We've done it already. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1253.58s)]
*  How long do you spend washing your hair? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1255.58s)]
*  Five minutes. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1257.58s)]
*  Three hours. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1259.58s)]
*  We really should. We should just go out tonight, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1263.58s)]
*  the three of us. We'll just see what happens. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1265.58s)]
*  We're going to attract three very [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1267.58s)]
*  different types of people. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1269.58s)]
*  We're girls? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1271.58s)]
*  I'm married. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1273.58s)]
*  I don't even know that. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1275.58s)]
*  We're girls just thrown at you like crazy? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1277.58s)]
*  No. When? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1279.58s)]
*  The Game of Thrones? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1281.58s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1283.58s)]
*  The Game of Thrones, even if you're married, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1285.58s)]
*  whatever, it must present itself. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1287.58s)]
*  Just the presentation. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1289.58s)]
*  Thank God I already had kids when Thrones was hitting. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1291.58s)]
*  A shout out to your wife, incredibly talented, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1293.58s)]
*  lovely lady. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1295.58s)]
*  Back to the girls throwing it at you. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1297.58s)]
*  It's a weird thing because [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1299.58s)]
*  when fame comes a little later, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1303.58s)]
*  you're just like, okay, great, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1305.58s)]
*  it's happening, but then maybe [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1307.58s)]
*  you sort of know how to navigate it better. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1309.58s)]
*  But I'm the personality [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1311.58s)]
*  which probably should have [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1313.58s)]
*  had more fun when I was younger. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1315.58s)]
*  But those young people [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1317.58s)]
*  who are getting people, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1319.58s)]
*  let's say men who are famous at a young age, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1321.58s)]
*  who are having the opposite sex [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1323.58s)]
*  or the same sex throwing themselves at them, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1325.58s)]
*  how would you ever trust that? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1327.58s)]
*  How do you [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1329.58s)]
*  trust that? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1331.58s)]
*  You're not falling for me, you're falling [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1333.58s)]
*  for this idea of I'm not that. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1335.58s)]
*  So it's very [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1337.58s)]
*  and I'm sure a lot of young people [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1339.58s)]
*  can speak much more eloquently [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1341.58s)]
*  than I can about it because they're living [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1343.58s)]
*  through it as we speak. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1345.58s)]
*  But yeah, that would be, and I'd see the young people [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1347.58s)]
*  on Thrones, which is huge, we go to [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1349.58s)]
*  Spain and there'd be people [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1351.58s)]
*  in the lobby like, hello, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1353.58s)]
*  what do you want to do? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1355.58s)]
*  Wow, that must be very [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1357.58s)]
*  It was like [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1359.58s)]
*  being a heavy metal musician in the 80s. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1361.58s)]
*  Like Motley Crue, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1363.58s)]
*  it was like our version of that [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1365.58s)]
*  and what those guys must have just [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1367.58s)]
*  had experienced. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1369.58s)]
*  Sorry, if we can backtrack a little bit, you've probably spoken about this, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1371.58s)]
*  but if you can indulge us, when you get the [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1373.58s)]
*  script for Game of Thrones, when you read [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1375.58s)]
*  Tyrion's character as the first [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1377.58s)]
*  season is being filmed, what are you thinking? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1379.58s)]
*  Are you thinking like, this is what I've been [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1381.58s)]
*  waiting for, I've never really gotten a [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1383.58s)]
*  role like this, I'm sure you get [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1385.58s)]
*  a lot of bullshit roles and stuff that you're like [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1387.58s)]
*  this is the same fucking thing I always get. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1389.58s)]
*  Then you get this guy, Tyrion, who's so [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1391.58s)]
*  complex, so smart, so [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1393.58s)]
*  layered, are you like, I get to flex now? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1395.58s)]
*  And then are you like, this is going to be it? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1397.58s)]
*  Yeah, first no, yes, I get to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1399.58s)]
*  flex, but I'm sort of maybe [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1401.58s)]
*  cynical about [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1403.58s)]
*  if something feels [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1405.58s)]
*  that good, it's not going to work. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1407.58s)]
*  Nobody's going to buy this. In the first season, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1409.58s)]
*  we didn't have any money, truly, I mean, it's all [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1411.58s)]
*  relative, we had some money. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1413.58s)]
*  But even at the end, if you visit [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1415.58s)]
*  our base camp, our trailers were the same [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1417.58s)]
*  as they were in the first season, it was really [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1419.58s)]
*  and I think that's what made the spirit [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1421.58s)]
*  of all of us come together so well. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1423.58s)]
*  And the crew, we roughed it, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1425.58s)]
*  man, you really would never know. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1427.58s)]
*  Our salaries got higher as it [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1429.58s)]
*  went along, but the conditions were kind [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1431.58s)]
*  of great, like an indie movie almost. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1433.58s)]
*  I mean, the sets were [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1435.58s)]
*  extraordinary and the costumes [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1437.58s)]
*  were extraordinary, that didn't feel indie, but [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1439.58s)]
*  the vibe did, and I think [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1441.58s)]
*  that's what really, but to answer [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1443.58s)]
*  your question, no, I was kind of [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1445.58s)]
*  cynical, like this is great, nobody's going to [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1447.58s)]
*  go for it. It's weird. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1449.58s)]
*  After the first season, do they [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1451.58s)]
*  start expanding your [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1453.58s)]
*  role, do you think that they saw something special? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1455.58s)]
*  They, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1457.58s)]
*  I don't know if you start expanding [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1459.58s)]
*  it, but they definitely start, what happens [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1461.58s)]
*  in TV, they start to write for the actor. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1463.58s)]
*  They gear it [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1465.58s)]
*  to your strengths and challenge [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1467.58s)]
*  your weaknesses. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1469.58s)]
*  So what did they try to challenge for you? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1471.58s)]
*  Oh shit, I set myself up. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1473.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1475.58s)]
*  My ability to act [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1477.58s)]
*  good. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1479.58s)]
*  No, I told them, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1481.58s)]
*  I knew David Benioff a little bit [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1483.58s)]
*  and I got to know Dan, thankfully, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1485.58s)]
*  now we're two of my close friends. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1487.58s)]
*  We're also [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1489.58s)]
*  the only Americans [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1491.58s)]
*  on that show. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1493.58s)]
*  Some of the producers were American, but I was the only American cast member. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1495.58s)]
*  Memoah was American, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1497.58s)]
*  he was on for the first season. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1499.58s)]
*  That was a fun, fun season. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1501.58s)]
*  So we sort of just got like [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1505.58s)]
*  houses and everybody else would sort of commute back and forth [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1507.58s)]
*  to London, so the three [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1509.58s)]
*  of us sort of spent a lot of time together [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1511.58s)]
*  being like sort of missing our families [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1513.58s)]
*  and being, you know, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1515.58s)]
*  Americans abroad. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1517.58s)]
*  But they definitely started, you could [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1519.58s)]
*  feel them warming up and making [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1521.58s)]
*  you sort of become [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1523.58s)]
*  synonymous. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1525.58s)]
*  So they start to understand you and how you're going to play this character [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1527.58s)]
*  and then they ride towards that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1529.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think so, yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1531.58s)]
*  They had the long [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1533.58s)]
*  game in their mind the whole time. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1535.58s)]
*  The map of the whole thing was exquisite. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1537.58s)]
*  But [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1539.58s)]
*  I just wanted to not be a fantasy dwarf. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1541.58s)]
*  I wanted to like, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1543.58s)]
*  not to be crass, but I wanted to have a [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1545.58s)]
*  dick. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1547.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1549.58s)]
*  And that's so like, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1551.58s)]
*  you know, when [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1553.58s)]
*  clinically what you are [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1557.58s)]
*  has become sort of [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1559.58s)]
*  poached by the fantasy world [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1561.58s)]
*  as a term for somebody who's not human. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1563.58s)]
*  Like a gnome [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1565.58s)]
*  or an ogre or whatever else. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1567.58s)]
*  Fairy, pixie, leprechaun, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1569.58s)]
*  elf, everything, dwarf. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1571.58s)]
*  No, no, that one's real. That one's actually a thing. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1573.58s)]
*  There's no gnomes in the world, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1575.58s)]
*  that's a thing. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1577.58s)]
*  But therefore when you do that, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1579.58s)]
*  you're [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1581.58s)]
*  clipped. You've got all kinds of fantastical [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1583.58s)]
*  things. Dragons, unicorns, dwarves. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1585.58s)]
*  Yeah, you're just clipped. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1587.58s)]
*  And I was like, I can't be clipped, guys. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1589.58s)]
*  I can't be clipped. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1591.58s)]
*  And they do that with not just people my [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1593.58s)]
*  size. They do that with [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1595.58s)]
*  nationality. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1597.58s)]
*  We've got to be careful. Who, who, who do they do? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1599.58s)]
*  Oh, throughout the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1601.58s)]
*  town. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1603.58s)]
*  I'm talking about what we were talking about before. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1605.58s)]
*  Every slave movie has black people in it for [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1607.58s)]
*  some reason. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1609.58s)]
*  When are we going to DI that? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1611.58s)]
*  Why do we all [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1613.58s)]
*  have slave owners? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1615.58s)]
*  Why do slave owners always gotta be white? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1617.58s)]
*  What's that about? It's disgusting. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1619.58s)]
*  It's negative stereotypes, dude. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1621.58s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1623.58s)]
*  I thought it was pretty cool [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1625.58s)]
*  as I was looking at all the things that you've done. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1627.58s)]
*  Again, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1629.58s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know when you first start maybe getting [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1631.58s)]
*  into it. There's certain things you have to do. But it seemed like [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1633.58s)]
*  you made a [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1635.58s)]
*  choice not to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1637.58s)]
*  play any of those [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1639.58s)]
*  roles that you would probably get offered. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1641.58s)]
*  Oh, I got offered. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1643.58s)]
*  Oh, I can imagine. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1645.58s)]
*  Early days, now they know better. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1647.58s)]
*  So we're not going to send that to Pete. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1649.58s)]
*  He'll be upset. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1651.58s)]
*  I'll just quick note. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1653.58s)]
*  Most people that want to be an actor, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1655.58s)]
*  let me [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1657.58s)]
*  rephrase that. Most people want to be famous [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1659.58s)]
*  through acting. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1661.58s)]
*  It's the difference. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1663.58s)]
*  It's the culture we're living in. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1665.58s)]
*  A lot of kids are asked what do you want to be when you grow up and they say fame. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1667.58s)]
*  Fame. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1669.58s)]
*  What's the substance of the fame? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1671.58s)]
*  No. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1673.58s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1675.58s)]
*  Everybody's [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1677.58s)]
*  coming at it from their [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1679.58s)]
*  unique angle. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1681.58s)]
*  I can only speak from [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1683.58s)]
*  my angle on what I wanted [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1685.58s)]
*  to do. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1687.58s)]
*  I think it's more to do with the people [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1689.58s)]
*  you surround yourself with. The people you're [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1691.58s)]
*  lucky to find along the way. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1693.58s)]
*  I call it the tribe. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1695.58s)]
*  You know, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1697.58s)]
*  you become friends with [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1699.58s)]
*  really good writers, really good directors, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1701.58s)]
*  and you start to do that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1703.58s)]
*  together. Because we're nothing without each other. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1705.58s)]
*  We can't act in a vacuum. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1707.58s)]
*  It's collaboration. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1709.58s)]
*  So you sort of hook your [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1711.58s)]
*  wagon to talent. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1713.58s)]
*  And hopefully [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1715.58s)]
*  friendships. And they're usually [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1717.58s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1719.58s)]
*  Do you have people in the [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1721.58s)]
*  dwarf community reaching out? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1723.58s)]
*  And saying [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1725.58s)]
*  in the tree [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1727.58s)]
*  hollow? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1729.58s)]
*  I didn't say where they lived. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1731.58s)]
*  I didn't say where they lived, Pete. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1733.58s)]
*  Hold on. Let me call them. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1735.58s)]
*  It's really small. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1737.58s)]
*  That's [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1739.58s)]
*  dwarven. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1741.58s)]
*  That's dwarven [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1743.58s)]
*  for [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1745.58s)]
*  somebody to page me. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1747.58s)]
*  You guys are pagers? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1751.58s)]
*  You guys are [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1753.58s)]
*  dealers. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1755.58s)]
*  I'm not asking it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1757.58s)]
*  I'm not on a fucking group chat or something. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1759.58s)]
*  I had a real thoughtful question, Buck. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1761.58s)]
*  I'm sure there are. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1763.58s)]
*  I'm just not on those group chats. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1765.58s)]
*  I'm not on social media. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1767.58s)]
*  You know that your fake Instagram account [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1769.58s)]
*  has four and a half million followers? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1771.58s)]
*  No way. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1773.58s)]
*  I met that person once [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1775.58s)]
*  at a press conference in [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1777.58s)]
*  Barcelona, maybe. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1779.58s)]
*  You believed them when they said that they ran it? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1781.58s)]
*  No, it was. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1783.58s)]
*  And he's a really young guy. And I went, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1785.58s)]
*  oh, I didn't know how to process [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1787.58s)]
*  it. Because he was like, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1789.58s)]
*  isn't that great? I'm that guy. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1791.58s)]
*  I'm really trying to... [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1793.58s)]
*  He was being altruistic, like helping me. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1795.58s)]
*  And I went, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1797.58s)]
*  I'm trying not to. You can do what you want to do. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1799.58s)]
*  Just be kind and don't take pictures of my kids. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1801.58s)]
*  I just went right for that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1803.58s)]
*  I admonished him for that. And he was so kind of... [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1805.58s)]
*  It was hard to argue with him [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1807.58s)]
*  because he was really sweet. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1809.58s)]
*  Young and he never did since. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1811.58s)]
*  I checked a couple of times [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1813.58s)]
*  just to make sure he wasn't. And he didn't. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1815.58s)]
*  He can't do that, man. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1817.58s)]
*  Leave the kids out of it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1819.58s)]
*  That's off limits. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1821.58s)]
*  Yeah, the kids... [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1823.58s)]
*  There's a couple things that are off limits. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1825.58s)]
*  And everybody instinctually should [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1827.58s)]
*  know those things as humans. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1829.58s)]
*  Yeah, but the desire for attention makes [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1831.58s)]
*  you often look the other way. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1833.58s)]
*  Yeah. That's a good one. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1835.58s)]
*  At what age did you... [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1837.58s)]
*  But it's strange when people [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1839.58s)]
*  set those up. It's more tension for me than them. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1841.58s)]
*  So is it... I don't... [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1843.58s)]
*  What's the reasoning? They couch it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1845.58s)]
*  They get to see the numbers go up. They still get [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1847.58s)]
*  the gamified dopamine hit from the platform. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1849.58s)]
*  Right, right, right. So anything [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1851.58s)]
*  more shocking [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1853.58s)]
*  gets more, I guess. Yeah, especially if they don't have kids [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1855.58s)]
*  if they're young. Then they're just like, oh yeah, it's just content. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1857.58s)]
*  My cousin posts their kids. Why can't... [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1859.58s)]
*  And we're also living in a culture where people are [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1861.58s)]
*  posing on magazine covers with their newborn [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1863.58s)]
*  babies. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1865.58s)]
*  I actually worry about that. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1867.58s)]
*  I just had a daughter. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1869.58s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1871.58s)]
*  Coolest thing ever. We did not know that, bro. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1873.58s)]
*  Oh, god, the best. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1875.58s)]
*  It's the fucking coolest thing ever. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1877.58s)]
*  You guys are good friends. Do you not [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1879.58s)]
*  keep up with this guy at all? I mainly ask him [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1881.58s)]
*  the questions. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1883.58s)]
*  So I know a lot about what's going on. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1885.58s)]
*  You gotta follow his fake account. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1887.58s)]
*  I'm gonna send you the fake account. It's great. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1889.58s)]
*  I wore capes too, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1891.58s)]
*  but you never fucking asked me. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1893.58s)]
*  No, but it's one of those things where it's like [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1897.58s)]
*  it's the coolest thing I've ever created in my [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1899.58s)]
*  entire life, my wife and I. She did most of the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1901.58s)]
*  creating. Oh, sure. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1903.58s)]
*  Big, god complex. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1905.58s)]
*  But don't they have it? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1907.58s)]
*  It's like just making life. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1909.58s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1913.58s)]
*  I feel like, okay, right now [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1915.58s)]
*  she could look like any baby, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1917.58s)]
*  but once she starts to look like just her, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1919.58s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I don't think she can ever be [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1921.58s)]
*  on social media, at least not mine. I don't want [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1923.58s)]
*  anybody to be able to recognize her. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1925.58s)]
*  But it's also this thing that I'm so proud of. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1927.58s)]
*  They become their own person too. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1929.58s)]
*  They're not doing this anymore. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1931.58s)]
*  They're eye rolling you. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1933.58s)]
*  Okay, so I'm a little bit terrified [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1935.58s)]
*  of that too. Are you at the point where [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1937.58s)]
*  the kids are going, hey, I need my own time, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1939.58s)]
*  dad. Like, you're bothering his dad. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1941.58s)]
*  I do that to them. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1943.58s)]
*  I have to go film a movie. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1947.58s)]
*  The greatest thing is they do, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1949.58s)]
*  they're their own person. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1951.58s)]
*  And your parent will tell you the same thing. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1953.58s)]
*  It's not overnight, it's [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1955.58s)]
*  gradual, and they're always their own person. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1957.58s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1959.58s)]
*  You can't take the credit anymore. The credit [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1961.58s)]
*  sort of fades away. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1963.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1965.58s)]
*  How old are you? 12 and 6. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1967.58s)]
*  12 and 6. Oh, 12 is like... [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1969.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's a real human. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1971.58s)]
*  She sure is. Ideas, opinions. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1973.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1975.58s)]
*  Telling you how the world is. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1977.58s)]
*  What is something she told you? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1979.58s)]
*  What is something she told you? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1981.58s)]
*  Shakespeare's overrated. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1983.58s)]
*  It's just great to just be, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1985.58s)]
*  just have enlightening conversations [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1987.58s)]
*  with your kid. But what was she saying? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1989.58s)]
*  Oh god, I mean, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1991.58s)]
*  you know, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1993.58s)]
*  Taylor Swift. I can tell you anything [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1995.58s)]
*  about Taylor Swift. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1997.58s)]
*  Taylor Swift is, let's talk about [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=1999.58s)]
*  culturally, Taylor Swift. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2001.58s)]
*  Because I'm in it. I'm in it deep [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2003.58s)]
*  in anybody with kids. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2005.58s)]
*  Not in... What? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2007.58s)]
*  Anybody who loves... [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2009.58s)]
*  I'm talking about that thing! [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2011.58s)]
*  Anybody with a tween [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2013.58s)]
*  can tell you the same thing. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2015.58s)]
*  Taylor Swift is just huge. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2017.58s)]
*  I mean, she's everywhere. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2019.58s)]
*  Get out of here! [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2021.58s)]
*  But I think, and I'm like, I think she's fantastic. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2023.58s)]
*  But I also go, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2025.58s)]
*  but what about Nirvana? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2027.58s)]
*  What about the Beatles? What about this? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2029.58s)]
*  What about that? But it's like, Taylor [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2031.58s)]
*  all the way. And my son [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2033.58s)]
*  loves Nirvana. And I'm like, thank god. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2035.58s)]
*  And we blast [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2037.58s)]
*  Nirvana in the car when we're together. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2039.58s)]
*  But when you're not around? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2041.58s)]
*  Taylor Swift. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2043.58s)]
*  And I think it's like, oh my god, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2045.58s)]
*  it's what people were like with like [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2047.58s)]
*  the Beatles. The old [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2049.58s)]
*  parents were like, what's that? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2051.58s)]
*  What is that stuff? It's all the time. We're hearing the Beatles. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2053.58s)]
*  But she's really [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2055.58s)]
*  something. How about politically? Have you guys [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2057.58s)]
*  had any... I had no point. I just [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2059.58s)]
*  wanted to bring up Taylor Swift. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2061.58s)]
*  You won tickets to the show. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2063.58s)]
*  Did you go see her? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2065.58s)]
*  I saw her on Rego, though, which was fantastic. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2067.58s)]
*  She's awesome. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2069.58s)]
*  And they're really good. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2071.58s)]
*  They're so good. And they're [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2073.58s)]
*  sort of broken through to [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2075.58s)]
*  what pop music can [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2077.58s)]
*  be a little bit bubblegum. And they've like put [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2079.58s)]
*  some real genius behind it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2081.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2083.58s)]
*  But yeah, you're not super, super... [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2085.58s)]
*  I'm starting to sweat. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2087.58s)]
*  Because I bring up like cultural [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2089.58s)]
*  icons and I'm saying the right thing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2091.58s)]
*  I love their music. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2093.58s)]
*  I really do. And I listen to it all the time. You gotta love it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2095.58s)]
*  Whose music sucks? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2097.58s)]
*  Overrated, overrated. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2099.58s)]
*  We just want to [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2101.58s)]
*  know whose music sucks, Pete. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2103.58s)]
*  Not Nirvana, obviously. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2105.58s)]
*  Who is long gone? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2107.58s)]
*  What about the Wizzy? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2109.58s)]
*  That caveman who was hitting the rockies? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2111.58s)]
*  He really did, dude. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2113.58s)]
*  But no, but there's like a very [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2115.58s)]
*  famous ska band that was popping up in [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2117.58s)]
*  Jersey back in the day. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2119.58s)]
*  Yeah, there was. They're hugely famous. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2121.58s)]
*  Yeah, hugely famous. The Wizzy? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2123.58s)]
*  The Wizzy. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2125.58s)]
*  You can not help them at all? Very familiar. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2127.58s)]
*  Very familiar. The Wizzy. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2129.58s)]
*  I like their earlier stuff. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2131.58s)]
*  They kind of fell off for me a little. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2133.58s)]
*  Yeah, what was it? What do you think happened? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2135.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2137.58s)]
*  I heard just [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2139.58s)]
*  they went through different ways. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2141.58s)]
*  I heard it was drugs [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2143.58s)]
*  and capes. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2145.58s)]
*  It was a huge addiction. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2147.58s)]
*  Is this [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2149.58s)]
*  the least known fact about you that you were [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2151.58s)]
*  one of the lead singers of a ska band? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2153.58s)]
*  We were rap. We tried to be [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2155.58s)]
*  the Beastie Boys. Rap, ska, everything. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2157.58s)]
*  But you were playing? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2159.58s)]
*  Trumpet. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2161.58s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2163.58s)]
*  At one gig, because we were so drunk, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2165.58s)]
*  somebody sat on it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2167.58s)]
*  I don't know how you can sit on a trumpet and completely [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2169.58s)]
*  bend the bell. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2171.58s)]
*  Damn. I still played it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2173.58s)]
*  I had [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2175.58s)]
*  one gig where I just got kicked in the heads. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2177.58s)]
*  I still have a scar here. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2179.58s)]
*  Blood was everywhere. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2181.58s)]
*  By a bandmate? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2183.58s)]
*  Accidentally, of course. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2185.58s)]
*  But the thing about bands back then [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2187.58s)]
*  is they don't last long because [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2189.58s)]
*  you don't have [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2191.58s)]
*  roadies. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2193.58s)]
*  And somebody always [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2195.58s)]
*  like our drummer Jim [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2197.58s)]
*  had a truck. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2199.58s)]
*  So if you have a truck, we gotta [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2201.58s)]
*  load the equipment in your truck, Jim. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2203.58s)]
*  And then you start to [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2205.58s)]
*  people get a little bit like [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2207.58s)]
*  Jim maybe wants to hang out afterward [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2209.58s)]
*  and not load up the truck. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2211.58s)]
*  There's the one girl that came [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2213.58s)]
*  to the show. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2215.58s)]
*  And you all share. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2217.58s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2219.58s)]
*  It was the 90s. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2221.58s)]
*  So [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2223.58s)]
*  you start to really get at each other. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2225.58s)]
*  And then [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2227.58s)]
*  the band's [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2229.58s)]
*  mission statement isn't fulfilled. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2231.58s)]
*  Some of us want to be actors. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2233.58s)]
*  Some of us want to be not in [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2235.58s)]
*  Wizzy for a long time. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2237.58s)]
*  Just the nature of it. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2239.58s)]
*  Did you ever think about [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2241.58s)]
*  bringing the band back together? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2243.58s)]
*  Well, surprise. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2245.58s)]
*  Come on. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2247.58s)]
*  Yeah, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2249.58s)]
*  I've lost touch with those guys. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2251.58s)]
*  Except for Jim, the drummer. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2253.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2255.58s)]
*  We had a lot of fun. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2257.58s)]
*  They're a great, great, great bunch of people. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2259.58s)]
*  We just were young. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2261.58s)]
*  And not musicians. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2263.58s)]
*  That's a huge [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2265.58s)]
*  No, that's not true. A couple of them were [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2267.58s)]
*  real good musicians. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2269.58s)]
*  Would you write the songs? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2271.58s)]
*  I'd co-write the lyrics, yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2273.58s)]
*  And did you release any? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2275.58s)]
*  I feel so old right now. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2277.58s)]
*  Oh yeah, I wrote those Wizzy lyrics. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2279.58s)]
*  We didn't release them. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2281.58s)]
*  This is the time of cassettes. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2283.58s)]
*  There's a demo on YouTube right now. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2285.58s)]
*  Your demo is on YouTube. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2287.58s)]
*  Nice. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2289.58s)]
*  That was fun. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2291.58s)]
*  We just got free drinks. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2293.58s)]
*  There's a couple years of my life. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2295.58s)]
*  Were you living in Williamsbury at the time? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2297.58s)]
*  I was. I was living in Williamsbury. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2299.58s)]
*  You lived in Williamsburg at the time that it was the most dangerous [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2301.58s)]
*  city in America almost. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2303.58s)]
*  I did. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2305.58s)]
*  A lot of us in the 90s [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2307.58s)]
*  graduate school, you move down [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2309.58s)]
*  to Manhattan. You don't even think of Brooklyn. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2311.58s)]
*  I lived on Ludlow Street. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2313.58s)]
*  Oh, Lower East Side, yeah. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2315.58s)]
*  The smallest apartment. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2317.58s)]
*  And then you move to Williamsburg [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2319.58s)]
*  because you couldn't afford Manhattan. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2321.58s)]
*  And as soon as you get a little scratch, you move back [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2323.58s)]
*  into Manhattan. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2325.58s)]
*  And then you get a little fame [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2327.58s)]
*  and you get the fuck out of Manhattan [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2329.58s)]
*  and you move back to Brooklyn. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2331.58s)]
*  Like we live in downtown Brooklyn now. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2333.58s)]
*  Because there's really good schools and people sort of [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2335.58s)]
*  genuinely leave you alone a little bit more. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2337.58s)]
*  Williamsburg was crazy in the 90s or what? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2339.58s)]
*  It was just affordable. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2341.58s)]
*  And a little empty. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2343.58s)]
*  I think that New York, I've never been... [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2345.58s)]
*  It was all the... [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2347.58s)]
*  All the... [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2349.58s)]
*  The Globals. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2351.58s)]
*  The Curleys were there. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2353.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2355.58s)]
*  Yvonne Zitlager can talk about that. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2357.58s)]
*  Calm down! [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2359.58s)]
*  Don't get it started! [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2361.58s)]
*  I get to talking about the dwarves, you can talk about the dwarves. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2363.58s)]
*  Our domain is this and this. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2367.58s)]
*  Don't get me riled up again. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2369.58s)]
*  Yes, no, it's just because it was cheap. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2373.58s)]
*  It was cheap. They say they aren't... [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2375.58s)]
*  No. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2377.58s)]
*  Elliot's here! [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2379.58s)]

*  Alright guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2421.58s)]
*  Let me solve a huge problem. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2423.58s)]
*  Hangovers. Are you ready? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2425.58s)]
*  Yes. Here it is. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2427.58s)]
*  Pay attention. It's done. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2429.58s)]
*  At my age, even a night of responsible drinking after shows can absolutely destroy ruin the next day. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2431.58s)]
*  You have like a few drinks, you're like, there's no way I'm going to feel this tomorrow. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2437.58s)]
*  No way I'm going to be hung over. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2439.58s)]
*  Yes, you are hung over. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2441.58s)]
*  This is God's way of letting you know you've had your fun. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2443.58s)]
*  Okay? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2445.58s)]
*  It's not time for fun. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2447.58s)]
*  It's time for parenting. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2449.58s)]
*  My point is there is a solution. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2451.58s)]
*  Z-biotics has figured it out. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2453.58s)]
*  Z-biotics is the world's first genetically engineered pre-alcohol probiotic. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2455.58s)]
*  When you drink alcohol, it gets converted into toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2457.58s)]
*  It's this toxic byproduct, not dehydration, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2459.58s)]
*  that's to blame for your alcohol use. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2461.58s)]
*  It's this toxic byproduct, not dehydration, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2463.58s)]

*  Z-biotics is a probiotic drink that produces an enzyme to break down this byproduct [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2471.58s)]
*  so you don't feel that hangover. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2473.58s)]
*  This is genius. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2475.58s)]
*  So just remember to make Z-biotics your first drink of the night. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2477.58s)]
*  So just remember to make Z-biotics your first drink of the night. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2479.58s)]

*  Drink responsibly and you'll feel your best tomorrow. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2483.58s)]
*  Telling you you have vacations, you have weddings, you have birthdays, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2485.58s)]
*  you have reunions, you just want to go out on a Tuesday [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2487.58s)]

*  Alright guys, let's take a break for a second, because we've got to talk about Zimbiatica. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2521.58s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot of supplement companies. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2523.58s)]
*  This is not just a supplement company. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2525.58s)]

*  What I'm telling you is they're going the extra mile. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2537.58s)]
*  First of all, Shilajit is a substance found in rocks in the Himalayas. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2539.58s)]
*  First of all, Shilajit is a substance found in rocks in the Himalayas. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2541.58s)]
*  It can improve memory, learning abilities, help the brain cope with stress, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2543.58s)]
*  help joint health, and improve muscle strength and vitality. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2545.58s)]
*  help joint health, and improve muscle strength and vitality. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2547.58s)]
*  The risk is that if you buy the wrong brand, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2549.58s)]
*  the risk is that if you buy the wrong brand, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2551.58s)]
*  your Shilajit may be tainted with free radicals, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2553.58s)]
*  your Shilajit may be tainted with free radicals, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2555.58s)]
*  mycotoxins, and a bunch of other things that are not good for you. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2557.58s)]
*  but with Zimbiatica, you know you're getting high quality shit. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2559.58s)]
*  each jar is manufactured on a strict quality control, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2561.58s)]

*  Now, Shub and his father have been taking this forever. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2569.58s)]
*  He put us onto this. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2571.58s)]
*  It is actually pretty amazing. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2573.58s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2575.58s)]
*  It's a little creepy looking when you first look at it, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2577.58s)]
*  it's like a little spider man on the moon. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2579.58s)]
*  but it is a vibe. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2581.58s)]
*  I want to show people what it looks like. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2583.58s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2585.58s)]
*  It's like Venom from the Spider-Man movies. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2587.58s)]
*  but it is a vibe and it has been incredibly helpful. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2589.58s)]
*  and yeah, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2591.58s)]

*  On the day. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2775.58s)]
*  Were you going to do something at home? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2777.58s)]
*  I knew you'd connect. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2779.58s)]
*  I thought... No, I was really... [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2783.58s)]
*  I wasn't surprised. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2785.58s)]
*  But what I found was interesting with you was [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2787.58s)]
*  you were doing stunts. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2789.58s)]
*  You did fight sequences. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2791.58s)]
*  You know, that's not... [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2793.58s)]
*  Yeah, the fight stuff was really cool. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2795.58s)]
*  Fight stuff was really cool. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2797.58s)]
*  He never tells us anything. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2799.58s)]
*  And they have to come together quick on that. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2801.58s)]
*  He's being right now, picking at his hands. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2803.58s)]
*  How lucky. He got in. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2805.58s)]
*  He's the only actor that got a scene inside. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2807.58s)]
*  He literally had 90% of his scenes inside. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2809.58s)]
*  And we're out there at minus 35 degrees. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2811.58s)]
*  Which was unbelievable. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2813.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2815.58s)]
*  But your movement, you took direction really well. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2817.58s)]
*  You didn't argue. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2819.58s)]
*  You riffed, which was... [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2821.58s)]
*  No, you guys were cool. It was awesome. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2823.58s)]
*  I thought it was really fun. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2825.58s)]
*  And I thought it looked beautiful. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2827.58s)]
*  Obviously, you sent me the film and it looks so amazing. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2829.58s)]
*  And, you know... [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2831.58s)]
*  It's pretty... [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2833.58s)]
*  I'm very proud of it. We worked really hard on it. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2835.58s)]
*  The guy who wrote the book that this is based on... [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2837.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2839.58s)]
*  ...was very excited about it. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2841.58s)]
*  Joe Lansdale, yeah. He's been helping us out with the promotion. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2843.58s)]
*  I see. I mean, he's hyped. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2845.58s)]
*  That's always great. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2847.58s)]
*  Because adaptations of books are a very hard thing to do. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2849.58s)]
*  They have to be separate entities. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2851.58s)]
*  And if you're too faithful to it, what's the point? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2853.58s)]
*  So we sort of... [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2855.58s)]
*  Took some liberties. Yeah, we had a great writer, Chris. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2857.58s)]
*  And he just sort of changed some things around. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2859.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2861.58s)]
*  You know, you have to. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2863.58s)]
*  Otherwise, just read the book. Right. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2865.58s)]
*  You're going to be that faithful. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2867.58s)]
*  That's an interesting take. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2869.58s)]
*  Most people are like, oh, this wasn't authentic to the book. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2871.58s)]
*  But that is a good point. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2873.58s)]
*  If you want exactly the book, read the book. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2875.58s)]
*  Well, I would argue that people want to see the book come to life. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2877.58s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2879.58s)]
*  Is there a picture in your head that you want to see? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2881.58s)]
*  Get it distilled. Get that essence of it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2883.58s)]
*  The spirit of it. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2885.58s)]
*  I think they did that with Thrones. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2887.58s)]
*  I mean, those things were... [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2889.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2891.58s)]
*  Harry Potter. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2893.58s)]
*  You have to pick and choose. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2895.58s)]
*  As a true fan. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2897.58s)]
*  Those are really faithful. I read those to my kids now. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2899.58s)]
*  They left a lot out. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2901.58s)]
*  You needed to for time. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2903.58s)]
*  But I feel like they definitely cast exactly what you think. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2905.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2907.58s)]
*  I mean, I'm all for movie making, obviously. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2909.58s)]
*  But sometimes it's a shame. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2911.58s)]
*  Because the imagination of who you think, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2913.58s)]
*  you just think of those actors now. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2915.58s)]
*  And now with Game of Thrones, you think of the actors. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2917.58s)]
*  So it's hard to read a book after you see the movie. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2919.58s)]
*  But no, the big thing was in the book, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2921.58s)]
*  and one of our other producers years ago had the inspired idea [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2925.58s)]
*  to make the villain a woman. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2929.58s)]
*  Because in the book, it's a man, a cutthroat bill. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2931.58s)]
*  And we changed it to a woman. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2935.58s)]
*  And I think that opened it up so much. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2937.58s)]
*  Let's see if we can make it more realistic. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2939.58s)]
*  Yeah, as a villain. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2941.58s)]
*  But you made her ugly. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2943.58s)]
*  Well, it's hard with Juliette Lewis. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2945.58s)]
*  But it was really... [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2947.58s)]
*  And you mean that seriously, I just want to point out. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2949.58s)]
*  Because they were going to think you were being sarcastic. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2951.58s)]
*  She's beautiful. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2953.58s)]
*  And you were being genuine. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2955.58s)]
*  She's beautiful. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2957.58s)]
*  But even now that you're looking at me like this... [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2959.58s)]
*  I'm not sarcastic. I hate sarcastic. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2961.58s)]
*  But you made a thing. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2963.58s)]
*  Why did you make a thing? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2965.58s)]
*  I didn't make a thing. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2967.58s)]
*  Did I do that? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2969.58s)]
*  You started that? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2971.58s)]
*  You're a dick. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2973.58s)]
*  No, I think it's just... [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2975.58s)]
*  Because otherwise, it's like the all-seeing thing. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2977.58s)]
*  He's like, out. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2981.58s)]
*  He's going to turn it into a bat and fly to the left. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2983.58s)]
*  Oh, you ought to hit the cape. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2987.58s)]
*  Oh, I still don't have a cape. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2989.58s)]
*  I still do that without the cape. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2991.58s)]
*  Get him a cape. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2993.58s)]
*  We made the villain into a woman played by Juliette, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2995.58s)]
*  beautiful Juliette Lewis. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=2999.58s)]
*  I think that was inspired. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3001.58s)]
*  Chris, the guy who wrote the screenplay, ran with that. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3003.58s)]
*  It made it so much better than the outlaw gang. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3007.58s)]
*  It was really guy-heavy, our film, as we all can attest to. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3011.58s)]
*  You don't want the women in the Westerns just to be victims. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3015.58s)]
*  Which they are so much. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3019.58s)]
*  We're inundated by that. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3021.58s)]
*  We're the long-suffering wife. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3023.58s)]
*  It's not just the domain of Westerns. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3025.58s)]
*  It made it really richer because it's not, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3027.58s)]
*  when is this guy going to try and hit this young woman? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3029.58s)]
*  It's sort of like she came at it with a real maternal instinct, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3033.58s)]
*  sick and protective. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3038.58s)]
*  It was really great. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3040.58s)]
*  It got so much deeper level. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3042.58s)]
*  She was almost like a parasite to their youth. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3045.58s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3048.58s)]
*  Otherwise, it's just sort of... [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3050.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3052.58s)]
*  I think that you guys are showcasing stories where women are bad. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3054.58s)]
*  I think that's what's fun about it. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3059.58s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3061.58s)]
*  Exactly, men are the heroes, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3063.58s)]
*  and they save the day for these awful women. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3065.58s)]
*  I think those stories are really important to get out there right now. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3067.58s)]
*  You know what I mean, Elliotte? You misogynist. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3071.58s)]
*  I mean, that was always going to be the real intention of the film. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3074.58s)]
*  I like how you snuck that in there. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3078.58s)]
*  Is it that subtle? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3080.58s)]
*  I haven't done my job, have I? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3082.58s)]
*  No, no, no. Elliotte is obviously a champion of women. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3084.58s)]
*  He directed rap videos for years. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3087.58s)]
*  Why don't you tell us something? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3089.58s)]
*  Wow, it's all making sense. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3095.58s)]
*  You see this? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3097.58s)]
*  Girls, girls, girls as well. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3099.58s)]
*  I think people think I'm being sarcastic, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3102.58s)]
*  but all the music videos that we watched growing up, Elliotte directed. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3105.58s)]
*  Just give us the bangers. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3109.58s)]
*  Oh, Method Man and Redman. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3111.58s)]
*  The Rock Waller. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3113.58s)]
*  I did Shine. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3115.58s)]
*  Wait, which one? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3117.58s)]
*  Skibbidi-bobbidi-bibbidi-booo. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3119.58s)]
*  Shine. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3121.58s)]
*  That's Gangster. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3123.58s)]
*  That's Gangster. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3125.58s)]
*  So there's this guy, Shine Barrow. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3127.58s)]
*  How did Shine slip my... [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3129.58s)]
*  No, no, you'll know this. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3131.58s)]
*  What year are we talking? 2008? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3133.58s)]
*  I'm going to tell you the story, it all makes sense. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3135.58s)]
*  Shine is this rapper that's coming out. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3137.58s)]
*  He's there at the nightclub when Sean P. Diddy Combs [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3139.58s)]
*  allegedly shot an adversary in a nightclub while he was dating J. Lo in New York City. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3143.58s)]
*  Shine ends up taking the blame, probably done by the lawyers of Sean P. Diddy Combs, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3151.58s)]
*  gets extradited, I believe, to Belize. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3159.58s)]
*  Oh, he's not Belivian, he's Belisian. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3163.58s)]
*  So basically Sean's team of lawyers puts the whole thing on Shine. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3165.58s)]
*  And I loved Shine, dude. I thought he was going to be that guy. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3173.58s)]
*  When it was really Diddy that actually did it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3175.58s)]
*  And now we know Diddy is a horrible human being that you fraternize with. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3177.58s)]
*  I was in that club that week, so what happened was we were scouting a video for a rapper called Black Rob. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3181.58s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3189.58s)]
*  You did Woe? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3191.58s)]
*  I was really sad because... [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3193.58s)]
*  These are iconic moments. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3195.58s)]
*  Did you really have one in the thick of it? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3197.58s)]
*  Like a rap or something? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3199.58s)]
*  Just something like... [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3201.58s)]
*  I guess you were the closest to your character in terms of the rap videos. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3203.58s)]
*  Because he's a pimp, is that what you're trying to say? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3207.58s)]
*  I'm not making that generalization. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3211.58s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3213.58s)]
*  We were in the club that week, and I remember we went and met J. Lo and Diddy together. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3215.58s)]
*  He wasn't very nice to her. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3221.58s)]
*  Wait, Wait. Diddy wasn't nice to J. Lo? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3223.58s)]
*  There was a guy called Big... [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3225.58s)]
*  Can I understand this? You're saying Diddy was mistreating the woman he was with? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3229.58s)]
*  We were shocked. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3235.58s)]
*  I can't believe this. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3237.58s)]
*  What was he doing though? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3239.58s)]
*  We did this big punk... [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3241.58s)]
*  So anyway, we really had a hard time calculating the script. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3243.58s)]
*  We can go on. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3245.58s)]
*  Give us the Diddy drama. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3247.58s)]
*  Oh, there's a rapper called Big Pun. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3249.58s)]
*  Who did that. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3253.58s)]
*  Of course, obviously. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3255.58s)]
*  Anyway, so he died. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3257.58s)]
*  And we did a tribute video. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3259.58s)]
*  And the tribute video was shot in the Bronx, and then we shot in Los Angeles. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3261.58s)]
*  And everybody was in it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3265.58s)]
*  Like Noriega, Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliott. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3267.58s)]
*  We're all in this house in Bel Air. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3269.58s)]
*  And Diddy walks in with J. Lo. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3273.58s)]
*  Actually hi, whatever. He's always very sweet to begin with. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3277.58s)]
*  And then she goes to the top of the stairs. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3281.58s)]
*  And I'm just watching this argument take place. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3283.58s)]
*  And I hear out of the corner of my ear, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3287.58s)]
*  Don't you fucking embarrass me, you... [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3289.58s)]
*  And I look up, I'm like, what? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3291.58s)]
*  And she literally goes, why? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3293.58s)]
*  And Liz sort of looks down at the floor. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3297.58s)]
*  And he's staring at her. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3301.58s)]
*  And she goes, okay, but can we have meatloaf from Cajun? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3303.58s)]
*  Okay, but can we have meatloaf from Cape Mantaniles afterwards? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3305.58s)]
*  And that was... [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3309.58s)]
*  So that's what it takes? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3311.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3313.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3315.58s)]
*  Yeah, but he was heavy. He was heavy. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3317.58s)]
*  I mean, when we did Woe, you know, I had... [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3319.58s)]
*  You know, what would happen is everybody would come out from the block. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3321.58s)]
*  There'd be like 300, 400 guys like screaming. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3323.58s)]
*  And it was very hard, you know, not that they were out of control, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3325.58s)]
*  but it's 300 or 400 people up in Spanish Harlem. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3328.58s)]
*  And he didn't have... [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3331.58s)]
*  He asked me... [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3333.58s)]
*  Absolutely fucking terrifying. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3335.58s)]
*  Who's a Jewish boy from London? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3337.58s)]
*  You see 300 to 400 black in Puerto Rico. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3339.58s)]
*  What is your knee-jerk reaction? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3341.58s)]
*  He got invited to the block party. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3343.58s)]
*  So he asked me... [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3345.58s)]
*  What do you do in that moment? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3347.58s)]
*  He asked me for a monitor and a milkshake. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3349.58s)]
*  And then I couldn't get it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3351.58s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3353.58s)]
*  Where's my monitor? Where's my milkshake? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3355.58s)]
*  And I'm standing there. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3357.58s)]
*  Where's my mother? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3359.58s)]
*  I'm looking at him. It's like 2 a.m. in the morning. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3361.58s)]
*  And then... [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3363.58s)]
*  I'm like, I'm so sorry. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3365.58s)]
*  So I step off. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3367.58s)]
*  And he had a guy who worked with him. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3369.58s)]
*  I'm not sure if I can say his name. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3371.58s)]
*  But the guy came up and he just said, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3373.58s)]
*  we don't like how you sound. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3375.58s)]
*  And I'm just like, what do you mean? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3377.58s)]
*  He goes, you're a long way from home. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3379.58s)]
*  And I was like, well, what do you mean by that? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3381.58s)]
*  He was just like, you better be careful. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3383.58s)]
*  And I made sure I always carried a milkshake with me. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3385.58s)]
*  Every video I did. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3387.58s)]
*  Except with Jay-Z, I never had to carry a milkshake with me. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3389.58s)]
*  What was the video you did with Jay? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3391.58s)]
*  I did Girls Girls Girls. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3393.58s)]
*  How was Jay? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3395.58s)]
*  I truly couldn't believe how professional he was. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3397.58s)]
*  He's the man. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3399.58s)]
*  And gracious. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3401.58s)]
*  And he had it down. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3403.58s)]
*  At the time, it was the day before 9-11. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3405.58s)]
*  We shot that video the day before 9-11. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3407.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3409.58s)]
*  What were you doing on fucking 9-11? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3411.58s)]
*  I mean, he wasn't in the towers. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3413.58s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3415.58s)]
*  He got the memo. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3417.58s)]
*  He goes, what was 9-11? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3419.58s)]
*  He was great. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3421.58s)]
*  He made a speech afterwards. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3423.58s)]
*  I said to him the day after, I said, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3425.58s)]
*  On 9-10, he was like, something crazy is about to happen. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3427.58s)]
*  The blueprint coming out. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3429.58s)]
*  The fact that 9-11 is coming out. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3431.58s)]
*  We've got some things in the air. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3433.58s)]
*  Literally. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3435.58s)]
*  We can't do this. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3437.58s)]
*  He made a speech. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3439.58s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3441.58s)]
*  I said, listen, you're in fucking New York. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3443.58s)]
*  You've got to talk. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3445.58s)]
*  He got up and said this is a tragedy. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3447.58s)]
*  It's a terrible thing. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3449.58s)]
*  I was really surprised that he did it. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3451.58s)]
*  But he felt he needed to do it. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3453.58s)]
*  Then we started talking about British gangster movies. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3455.58s)]
*  He goes, what are you doing next? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3457.58s)]
*  I'm going off to Hawaii. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3459.58s)]
*  He goes, why are you going to Hawaii? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3461.58s)]
*  I'm going to dive with sharks. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3463.58s)]
*  He goes, man, that's dangerous. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3465.58s)]
*  I'm like, wait a second. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3467.58s)]
*  You just did a fucking double album with R. Kelly. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3469.58s)]
*  That's fucking dangerous. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3471.58s)]
*  Elliot, how do you become, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3475.58s)]
*  how does a Jewish guy from London [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3477.58s)]
*  become the go-to director [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3479.58s)]
*  for the iconic music videos? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3481.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3485.58s)]
*  I actually don't know how. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3487.58s)]
*  Was there one that was so amazing [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3489.58s)]
*  that everybody else started calling? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3491.58s)]
*  I worked with Santi Gold. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3493.58s)]
*  I think it was because I worked with Santi Gold. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3495.58s)]
*  She was very, very cool. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3497.58s)]
*  So she was the tastemaker. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3499.58s)]
*  Santi Gold is the tastemaker. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3501.58s)]
*  And then Jessica Simpson. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3503.58s)]
*  I did her biggest video. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3505.58s)]
*  I did a song called With You. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3507.58s)]
*  And as soon as [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3509.58s)]
*  Method Man and Red Man saw the Jessica Simpson video, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3511.58s)]
*  that's our guy. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3517.58s)]
*  And this is when music videos were... [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3519.58s)]
*  They were movies. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3521.58s)]
*  And there was an MTV that showed videos. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3523.58s)]
*  How were Meth and Red? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3525.58s)]
*  So I did this video called De Rockwilder. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3527.58s)]
*  Classic song. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3529.58s)]
*  So how were they? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3531.58s)]
*  They were fantastic. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3533.58s)]
*  But we were shooting up on this big [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3535.58s)]
*  sort of runway. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3537.58s)]
*  It was about 50 feet up. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3539.58s)]
*  And there was no safety for them. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3541.58s)]
*  And we had this big sort of styrofoam egg. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3543.58s)]
*  And they were getting, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3545.58s)]
*  they were drinking and having a good time. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3547.58s)]
*  And I said to Red Man, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3549.58s)]
*  I said, listen, do me a favor, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3551.58s)]
*  just slow down, just for a half an hour. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3553.58s)]
*  Slow down, just for a half an hour. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3555.58s)]
*  Slow down on the booze. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3557.58s)]
*  So they get up there, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3559.58s)]
*  roll camera, action. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3561.58s)]
*  Literally comes out, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3563.58s)]
*  chugs a bottle of Henny. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3565.58s)]
*  And you see at the beginning of the video, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3567.58s)]
*  throws a bottle of Henny. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3569.58s)]
*  And yeah, that was the highlight of the night. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3571.58s)]
*  And then we had, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3573.58s)]
*  in the video they jump on a car [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3575.58s)]
*  and there's pyrotechnics that go everywhere. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3577.58s)]
*  There you go. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3579.58s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3581.58s)]
*  This little thing drops off [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3583.58s)]
*  50 feet on each side? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3585.58s)]
*  There's no safety. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3587.58s)]
*  Method Man was so cool though. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3589.58s)]
*  Both of them were the fucking shit. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3591.58s)]
*  Just like the slag. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3593.58s)]
*  There's a bit where they jump on a car. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3595.58s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3597.58s)]
*  So I knock on the door [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3599.58s)]
*  and I say, listen, we've got to do pyrotechnics. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3601.58s)]
*  You know, you've got to talk to the actor [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3603.58s)]
*  or the performer like, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3605.58s)]
*  we're about, there you go, it's about here. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3607.58s)]
*  So I said to them, just slow down. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3609.58s)]
*  And then Reg says, I'm a mushroom. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3611.58s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to put you on a car [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3613.58s)]
*  and you're tripping your tits off. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3615.58s)]
*  And you'll see the expression on his face. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3617.58s)]
*  He literally doesn't know where he is. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3619.58s)]
*  When he's on the car. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3621.58s)]
*  Yeah, when he's on the car. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3623.58s)]

*  Maybe the pirate is a little funny. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3643.58s)]
*  That's so much fun. I didn't even know black dudes were doing mushrooms back in the day. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3645.58s)]
*  They really were ahead of their time. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=3649.58s)]

*  Texas of Canada. So we would get in [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4379.58s)]
*  that car. They'd be all polite. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4381.58s)]
*  And then, you know, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4383.58s)]
*  I would just kind of be asking some questions. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4385.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? And within [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4387.58s)]
*  like a few minutes, they were like, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4389.58s)]
*  that COVID... Get out! [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4391.58s)]
*  No, no, they would do the [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4393.58s)]
*  COVID was a hoax. They were like, I'm not getting [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4395.58s)]
*  faxed. And I was like, these are my people. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4397.58s)]
*  I found my people [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4399.58s)]
*  in the transport team [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4401.58s)]
*  in Calgary. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4403.58s)]
*  So that is a positive. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4405.58s)]
*  You're trans. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4407.58s)]
*  I remember once in Gun [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4409.58s)]
*  Thrones, we had a driver, forget which [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4411.58s)]
*  country, we were not in Belfast because we had our crew [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4413.58s)]
*  there, but we were somewhere weird, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4415.58s)]
*  remote. And there was a... [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4417.58s)]
*  She would speak in tongues. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4419.58s)]
*  And she would be driving and she'd go [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4421.58s)]
*  and it wasn't Tourette's. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4423.58s)]
*  It was like, she was like, I'm just contacting my higher spirit [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4425.58s)]
*  at going like 60 kilometers [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4427.58s)]
*  an hour. Excuse me? What? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4429.58s)]
*  It was wild. Did you did you inquire [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4431.58s)]
*  about this at all [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4433.58s)]
*  with Ben Hoffman? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4435.58s)]
*  It was a [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4437.58s)]
*  talk. Yeah, it was [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4439.58s)]
*  wild because then you go, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4441.58s)]
*  who's going to pick my family up at the airport? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4443.58s)]
*  Not this person. The witch. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4445.58s)]
*  You hired a witch. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4447.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4449.58s)]
*  That was a wild thing. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4451.58s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4453.58s)]
*  I guess what we're trying to say is that women [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4455.58s)]
*  can drive. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4457.58s)]
*  If they're possessed by a man. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4459.58s)]
*  That's kind of what you were getting at. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4463.58s)]
*  Damn it, Mark! [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4465.58s)]
*  Mark, what are you doing right now? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4467.58s)]
*  Pete, come back! Don't hide! [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4469.58s)]
*  Pete, don't hide! I thought that's what you were [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4471.58s)]
*  going to say. Pete, we need you. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4473.58s)]
*  That's the only reason why I'm here basically. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4475.58s)]
*  Pete, we [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4477.58s)]
*  need you here. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4479.58s)]
*  Okay, listen, this movie, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4481.58s)]
*  can we get into promo mode? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4483.58s)]
*  I thought I did a really good job. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4485.58s)]
*  So, Calgary, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4487.58s)]
*  and you just went [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4489.58s)]
*  women drivers. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4491.58s)]
*  They were good at driving. They got us [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4493.58s)]
*  there every single time. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4495.58s)]
*  Do you believe in ghosts? You think ghosts are real or no? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4497.58s)]
*  Be honest. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4499.58s)]
*  It's like the way you look at it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4501.58s)]
*  Can I tell you something about Mark? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4503.58s)]
*  Do you guys see the Sixth Sense? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4505.58s)]
*  You should delete him out of this. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4507.58s)]
*  I'm in camo. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4509.58s)]
*  I'm in camo. I'm halfway gone. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4511.58s)]
*  You can barely see me. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4513.58s)]
*  Where's the time haven't you? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4515.58s)]
*  The bottom half is just weird 80s jeans shorts. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4517.58s)]
*  We're both Catholics. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4519.58s)]
*  He believes in demons 100%. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4521.58s)]
*  So it's against the law for us. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4523.58s)]
*  He believes in them. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4525.58s)]
*  He is like... [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4527.58s)]
*  Wiccan? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4529.58s)]
*  The opposite. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4531.58s)]
*  Isn't your sister Wiccan? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4533.58s)]
*  No, she just does drugs. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4535.58s)]
*  Send to my mom. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4537.58s)]
*  So he is 100% [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4539.58s)]
*  sincere in believing in demons. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4541.58s)]
*  I've never seen a demon. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4543.58s)]
*  They're out there. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4545.58s)]
*  They just have skin. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4547.58s)]
*  And they wear suits. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4549.58s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4551.58s)]
*  Wait a minute. Did you get invited to like a [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4553.58s)]
*  Weinstein hotel or something? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4555.58s)]
*  What did he offer you? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4557.58s)]
*  There's more than one Weinstein out there. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4559.58s)]
*  Whoa! [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4561.58s)]

*  Give us the good stuff. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4567.58s)]
*  Country's falling apart. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4569.58s)]
*  Back to the Wiccan. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4571.58s)]
*  I've never seen a demon but in my brain [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4573.58s)]
*  they still might be out there. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4575.58s)]
*  Sometimes I'll see something [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4577.58s)]
*  move in the room like a shadow. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4579.58s)]
*  I'm like, hold on. What the fuck? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4581.58s)]
*  This is genuine sincerity. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4583.58s)]
*  I never did ask. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4585.58s)]
*  It's too much organic shit [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4587.58s)]
*  going through you. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4589.58s)]

*  I mean, the twenties were crazy. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4609.58s)]
*  So you have seen a ghost. See, I'm not fucking crazy. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4611.58s)]
*  No, I never saw a ghost. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4613.58s)]

*  crazy hallucinations during [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4617.58s)]
*  this wild time in the twenties? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4619.58s)]
*  In the 1920s? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4621.58s)]
*  Yeah, during this wild time in the [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4623.58s)]
*  early 1900s. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4625.58s)]
*  They're all these flapper girls. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4627.58s)]
*  I was wearing spats. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4629.58s)]
*  No, I just like listening to music and [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4635.58s)]
*  seeing some colors and [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4637.58s)]
*  you're wondering when it's going to [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4639.58s)]
*  because when you have a certain amount of anxiety [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4641.58s)]
*  like me, you wonder, okay, when is it going to [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4643.58s)]

*  No, no, but just like, okay. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4651.58s)]
*  It's enough. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4653.58s)]
*  We're done. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4655.58s)]
*  It's lasting too long. I'm a control freak. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4657.58s)]
*  That's why I don't do drugs anymore because [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4659.58s)]
*  they just stick around. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4661.58s)]
*  It's like a guest that won't leave. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4663.58s)]
*  That's all. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4665.58s)]
*  I guess microdosing is what everybody's doing now. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4667.58s)]
*  I don't even know what's the point. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4669.58s)]
*  Back in the day, we macrodosed. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4671.58s)]

*  It's not though. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4675.58s)]
*  It destroys families' [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4677.58s)]
*  lives. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4679.58s)]
*  It's a profession. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4681.58s)]
*  It really kind of might be the worst. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4685.58s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4687.58s)]
*  I'm so glad you didn't indulge your stupid [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4689.58s)]

*  Andrew, that it's the worst. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4695.58s)]
*  But [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4697.58s)]
*  Chiching. I thought I had [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4699.58s)]
*  one right there. I thought I was really on it. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4701.58s)]
*  No. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4703.58s)]
*  I put nicotine above it. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4705.58s)]
*  Everybody smoked back in the day. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4707.58s)]
*  Now it's Zin. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4709.58s)]
*  Camel lights. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4711.58s)]
*  Do you know the Zins? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4713.58s)]
*  Do you know what the Zins are? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4715.58s)]
*  No. Magazines. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4717.58s)]
*  Oh, that's Zin. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4719.58s)]
*  The Zins are these little pouches people put [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4721.58s)]
*  under their lips. You haven't seen this? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4723.58s)]
*  That's called human tobacco. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4725.58s)]
*  No, but now it comes in a pouch. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4727.58s)]
*  Actually, David, can you ask David if he can get some? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4729.58s)]
*  I put it in my mouth for 30 seconds, then I'd had diarrhea for three days. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4731.58s)]
*  So it's probably... [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4733.58s)]
*  The problem is weight loss. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4735.58s)]
*  It's a diuretic. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4737.58s)]
*  It's hard to make an Indian have diarrhea. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4739.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4741.58s)]
*  That's true. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4743.58s)]
*  It's nearly impossible [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4745.58s)]
*  to make... Like he's built [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4747.58s)]
*  for hard shit. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4749.58s)]
*  I'm built for semi-soft shit. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4751.58s)]
*  Would you ever do hot ones? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4753.58s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. But I would [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4755.58s)]
*  feel a lot of pressure. Like if Alex played him like a charity [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4757.58s)]
*  basketball game, I would have the same... [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4759.58s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta show up. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4763.58s)]
*  You gotta show up. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4765.58s)]
*  Same level of like, God, who is the [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4767.58s)]
*  one actress, Jenna Ortega, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4769.58s)]
*  just bodied that whole shit? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4771.58s)]
*  I would feel like I would have to go with that hammer. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4773.58s)]
*  She did really well on hot ones. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4775.58s)]
*  Is it weird to bring up another show on your show? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4777.58s)]
*  Not at all. The one funny thing about that, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4779.58s)]
*  I mean, actually I fucking hate you. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4781.58s)]
*  We're beating. We have a public beef. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4783.58s)]
*  I don't remember when I was on that. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4785.58s)]
*  I think the thing about that show that's so interesting is that like... [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4787.58s)]
*  It's a great premise. Better than this one. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4789.58s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4791.58s)]
*  What is the premise here? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4793.58s)]
*  The premise is saying really expensive things. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4795.58s)]
*  Being racist wigs with even racist answers. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4797.58s)]
*  Being really... Being an asshole. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4799.58s)]
*  America! USA. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4801.58s)]
*  Yay, because we're in such good shape right now. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4803.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4805.58s)]
*  The show is... [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4807.58s)]
*  You know we had a Civil War once. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4809.58s)]
*  We did. Didn't it work out? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4811.58s)]
*  Well, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4813.58s)]
*  don't we think? What were you about to say? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4815.58s)]
*  The Jew... [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4817.58s)]
*  No, no, the show is... [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4819.58s)]
*  I think... [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4821.58s)]
*  I think the guy is overshadowed by the show. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4823.58s)]
*  I think the interviewer is actually excellent. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4825.58s)]
*  Is that why you're trying so hard? No. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4827.58s)]
*  To be bigger than your show? I just need chicken. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4829.58s)]
*  We need chicken. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4831.58s)]
*  We need another thing. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4833.58s)]
*  I'm not trying to say that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4835.58s)]
*  We need another thing. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4837.58s)]
*  I think the interviewer is fantastic. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4839.58s)]
*  I think people think it's about the chicken. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4841.58s)]
*  And it's not. He just asked really good questions. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4843.58s)]
*  It's like it's not about the dragons. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4845.58s)]
*  It's not about the chicken. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4847.58s)]
*  Circle him back. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4849.58s)]
*  And they're trying to sell the show without him. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4851.58s)]
*  But nobody wants to buy it without him [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4853.58s)]
*  because the show is really about him. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4855.58s)]
*  I want to do that show. I think he's fantastic. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4857.58s)]
*  I think you'd be great on that show. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4859.58s)]
*  I think you're fantastic. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4861.58s)]
*  You didn't have to compare. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4863.58s)]
*  But the fact that you said that... [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4865.58s)]
*  It meant a lot. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4867.58s)]
*  Let's compare. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4869.58s)]
*  Would I eat chicken in front of people? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4871.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4873.58s)]
*  As a white man? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4875.58s)]

*  So those 90's videos. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4879.58s)]
*  What else am I going to do? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4881.58s)]
*  Do you want me to sit there and eat watermelon [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4883.58s)]
*  as a white man? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4885.58s)]

*  Who wants me to play basketball as a white man? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4897.58s)]
*  Who wants me to eat jacket potatoes [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=4899.58s)]

*  I feel like [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5596.58s)]
*  comedy is at the front lines [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5598.58s)]
*  of, which it shouldn't be. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5600.58s)]
*  It should be the opposite of what's [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5602.58s)]
*  dying in the movie business. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5604.58s)]
*  Because it's really hard to make a comedy [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5606.58s)]
*  that's released in theaters. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5608.58s)]
*  And it shouldn't be because you want the people [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5610.58s)]
*  around you to laugh and everything. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5612.58s)]
*  But people are getting their fix from YouTube. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5614.58s)]
*  From YouTube. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5616.58s)]
*  I got my laugh for the day. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5618.58s)]
*  Tic-toc. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5620.58s)]
*  And I don't want the long form comedy anymore. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5622.58s)]
*  Because show me the laugh [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5624.58s)]
*  beginning to end. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5626.58s)]
*  Like a Hal Ashby movie. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5628.58s)]
*  I don't want to follow a narrative to get my laugh. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5630.58s)]
*  I want a quick fix. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5632.58s)]
*  So, we gotta watch that. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5634.58s)]
*  I think that you were on to something. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5636.58s)]
*  I don't know what I'm on to. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5638.58s)]
*  But I feel like [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5640.58s)]
*  you guys are all funny. We should watch that. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5642.58s)]
*  International audience. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5644.58s)]
*  Long form comedies. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5646.58s)]
*  My understanding was internationally [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5648.58s)]
*  it doesn't play as well because so many jokes are so [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5650.58s)]
*  so whatever. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5652.58s)]
*  I mean you were in a Marvel movie. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5654.58s)]
*  It's like that internationally will play. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5656.58s)]
*  Comedy you don't know if the joke is going to translate [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5658.58s)]
*  well in... [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5660.58s)]
*  But you need the patience for the... [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5662.58s)]
*  I agree. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5664.58s)]
*  And I feel like... [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5666.58s)]
*  I also think if you put out a comedy [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5668.58s)]
*  movie that's not funny [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5670.58s)]
*  it is wildly disappointing to go see. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5672.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's so sad. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5674.58s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5676.58s)]
*  And I think people are a little bit hesitant. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5678.58s)]
*  Culturally I think that [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5680.58s)]
*  pendulum swing and you know I think [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5682.58s)]
*  there was a moment where it swung in a direction where people [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5684.58s)]
*  were a little scared about taking some chances. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5686.58s)]
*  I think the pendulum swung back. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5688.58s)]
*  But it takes time to make [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5690.58s)]
*  film. So in the next maybe year, two, or [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5692.58s)]
*  three then maybe we'll get some fun stuff. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5694.58s)]
*  But I also think like people want [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5696.58s)]
*  convenience man. You can watch a movie [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5698.58s)]
*  at home. You can watch the greatest [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5700.58s)]
*  TV shows at home. You want me to put on [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5702.58s)]
*  shoes and [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5704.58s)]
*  an outfit and get a babysitter and go to the [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5706.58s)]
*  fucking... Crinkling next door to me. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5708.58s)]
*  We saw Dune. We saw Dune. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5710.58s)]
*  In San Francisco. We watched Dune. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5712.58s)]
*  You had a Sour Patch Kids crinkler next to you. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5714.58s)]
*  This was actually... It was more than that. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5716.58s)]
*  I had someone ironic... [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5718.58s)]
*  I'll shush my own kids for doing that. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5720.58s)]
*  I fucking loved it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5722.58s)]
*  I had a guy ironically [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5724.58s)]
*  laughing next to us. Like he was so [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5726.58s)]
*  in on it. Oh god. He's like [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5728.58s)]
*  oh that wasn't exactly how it was. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5730.58s)]
*  And now I feel like I'm not [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5734.58s)]
*  getting it. So now I'm [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5736.58s)]
*  insecure about my own consumption of the [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5738.58s)]
*  movie and I can't just get lost in the picture. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5740.58s)]
*  Which I want to get lost in. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5742.58s)]
*  And I had that moment where I'm [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5744.58s)]
*  like I have a big screen at home. I have a good [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5746.58s)]
*  sound system. Dune's coming out [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5748.58s)]
*  in like a week. Fucking two weeks. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5750.58s)]
*  So then should [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5752.58s)]
*  we all be making stuff for... [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5754.58s)]
*  I mean the money isn't there obviously. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5756.58s)]
*  But should we make stuff for [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5758.58s)]
*  streaming because that is how people are consuming [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5760.58s)]
*  things or should we push people to theaters? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5762.58s)]
*  Well I think it's sort of [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5764.58s)]
*  Spielberg I heard an interview [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5766.58s)]
*  with him and he's like I don't run a studio [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5768.58s)]
*  but even for promotion [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5770.58s)]
*  for the diehards that don't have [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5772.58s)]
*  a big screen who want to see it on the big screen. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5774.58s)]
*  And it's also the sound because sound at home [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5776.58s)]
*  isn't as good as some of those things. It depends on the [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5778.58s)]
*  movie theater. We have Alamo in Brooklyn which [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5780.58s)]
*  is incredible. The seats are incredible. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5782.58s)]
*  They play great movies. They play retrospectives. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5784.58s)]
*  But Spielberg said in this interview where he's like [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5786.58s)]
*  I don't run a studio but [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5788.58s)]
*  show it for a couple weeks for the diehards [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5790.58s)]
*  and for promotion [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5792.58s)]
*  for when you stream it. Just give it [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5794.58s)]
*  that chance. Also [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5796.58s)]
*  don't allow that chance [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5798.58s)]
*  to go away because like me [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5800.58s)]
*  who back in the day when I would like [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5802.58s)]
*  line... I remember with my friends we lined [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5804.58s)]
*  up for Cape Fear on the [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5806.58s)]
*  opening day. Cape Fear opened [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5808.58s)]
*  and there was one guy ahead of us. We were [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5810.58s)]
*  up all night drinking and we got [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5812.58s)]
*  there at like the first showing at like 10am [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5814.58s)]
*  and there was one guy in front [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5816.58s)]
*  of us already on the line. It was like [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5818.58s)]
*  crazy. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5820.58s)]
*  This middle aged guy by himself and you're like wow [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5822.58s)]
*  you're more of a diehard than we are. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5824.58s)]
*  And that was the excitement. It was communal. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5826.58s)]
*  Waiting in line. I saw Star Wars [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5828.58s)]
*  five times when I was a kid and part of it [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5830.58s)]
*  was like what [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5832.58s)]
*  number is this for you? The community of standing in [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5834.58s)]
*  line. It was so fun. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5836.58s)]
*  We didn't have the [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5838.58s)]
*  thing at home. For stand up or I mean for comedy [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5840.58s)]
*  so much of laughter is [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5842.58s)]
*  contagious. That will [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5844.58s)]
*  never go away. So seeing it in the theater with [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5846.58s)]
*  everybody laughing and then you get to share that laugh [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5848.58s)]
*  you'll laugh more than you will if you watch it by yourself. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5850.58s)]
*  I wish there was and that's why [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5852.58s)]
*  live comedy so much of it is better [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5854.58s)]
*  so much of the reason is better than watching on TV [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5856.58s)]
*  because we get to share the laugh. Yeah. Also [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5858.58s)]
*  I think that's why horror still works in the theaters. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5860.58s)]
*  Horror needs a collective. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5862.58s)]
*  We're scared together. Yeah we're scared [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5864.58s)]
*  together so there's the comfort of being together. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5866.58s)]
*  Like watching a fucking scary movie by [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5868.58s)]
*  yourself. Psycho. Alone. Psycho. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5870.58s)]
*  You gotta go to sleep after that shit. Yeah. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5872.58s)]
*  But watching it with you know 100 other [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5874.58s)]
*  people or 200 other people you get to leave going [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5876.58s)]
*  oh my god that was crazy. This person [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5878.58s)]
*  throws their popcorn. It's a fun. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5880.58s)]
*  You kind of laugh after you get scared. It breaks [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5882.58s)]
*  the tension a little bit. That's an interesting point about [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5884.58s)]
*  like the you would [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5886.58s)]
*  brag it was almost a badge of honor. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5888.58s)]
*  How many times you saw a thing. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5890.58s)]
*  Right. And that is gone. Right. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5892.58s)]
*  I don't think there's the redundancy [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5894.58s)]
*  anymore like oh I saw [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5896.58s)]
*  Titanic five times or [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5898.58s)]
*  whatever people ended up seeing. Right. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5900.58s)]
*  I'm trying to think of a movie that I saw in the theater [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5902.58s)]
*  like and I was like happy to see it multiple [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5904.58s)]
*  times. We also know about everything before [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5906.58s)]
*  we see it now too. Oh you think [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5908.58s)]
*  too much is spoiled. Oh [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5910.58s)]
*  definitely. So by the time the [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5912.58s)]
*  film is coming out the internet has spoiled it. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5914.58s)]
*  TikTok has spoiled it. All the [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5916.58s)]
*  writers are spoiled. Think about it. 1977 [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5918.58s)]
*  when I was a kid I didn't know what [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5920.58s)]
*  a Chewbacca was or a C-3PO. So the [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5922.58s)]
*  first time you see it. The first you see it you're going [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5924.58s)]
*  what the fuck. What is it? See what? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5926.58s)]
*  And it's almost like I have to go and [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5928.58s)]
*  watch this again because now I know what it [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5930.58s)]
*  is so I can. No that's a fantastic [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5932.58s)]
*  point. The first time you were at the [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5934.58s)]
*  movie. It's the first time. Your [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5936.58s)]
*  mind is blown. Yeah. Now we [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5938.58s)]
*  go into the movie in the same way you go into a [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5940.58s)]
*  restaurant. I already know the best dishes. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5942.58s)]
*  I know what everybody recommends. Maybe New York is going to be in this. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5944.58s)]
*  Yeah. But let's like everybody on [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5946.58s)]
*  the I'm old this is going to sound very [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5948.58s)]
*  old but everybody on the dating websites [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5950.58s)]
*  I've told you I know it's mostly lies but I've [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5952.58s)]
*  told you everything about it. Every single thing about it. What's it to talk about? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5954.58s)]
*  There's nothing. There's no there's no slow [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5956.58s)]
*  reveal. And even that slow [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5958.58s)]
*  reveal is redundant because I already [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5960.58s)]
*  read everything. There's nothing more romantic than the slow reveal. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5962.58s)]
*  Yes. Finding something about [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5964.58s)]
*  somebody. It's the [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5966.58s)]
*  Lewis and Clark of the [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5968.58s)]
*  bedroom. Yeah. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5970.58s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That is. Yeah. You won't cover [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5972.58s)]
*  a shared interest. You're like oh fuck. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5974.58s)]
*  You just got even better. Oh my god you love [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5976.58s)]
*  jean shorts too. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5978.58s)]
*  We're meant to be together. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5980.58s)]
*  You didn't put that on your website. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5982.58s)]
*  That's a great point. If I know everything why do I have to [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5984.58s)]
*  get ready and go to the thing. If I [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5986.58s)]
*  knew nothing everything I'm about [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5988.58s)]
*  to consume is going to be a surprise. Right. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5990.58s)]
*  And that's what it makes sense [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5992.58s)]
*  why horror is. We cushion ourselves [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5994.58s)]
*  to not [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5996.58s)]
*  have the [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=5998.58s)]
*  unhappy ending. Yeah. And sometimes [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6000.58s)]
*  unhappy endings in terms of everything [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6002.58s)]
*  is like really important. Now [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6004.58s)]
*  think about it. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6006.58s)]
*  You're going to talk about happy endings. No no no. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6008.58s)]
*  I would love to. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6010.58s)]
*  But think about horror [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6012.58s)]
*  still gives you that [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6014.58s)]
*  experience live because it's not [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6016.58s)]
*  seeing a Chewbacca. It's the surprise of this [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6018.58s)]
*  person jumping out. So you still get [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6020.58s)]
*  that surprise. Right. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6022.58s)]
*  In most other genres [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6024.58s)]
*  you're being tipped off to what's going to happen. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6026.58s)]
*  Right. So what [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6028.58s)]
*  we crave is that surprise. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6030.58s)]
*  Right. And if you're not going to provide that [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6032.58s)]
*  surprise I might as well watch it at home. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6034.58s)]
*  Right. And you want to rush [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6036.58s)]
*  with the horror you want to rush to the theater [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6038.58s)]
*  because like the great movies like Six Sons [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6040.58s)]
*  and Get Out is like [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6042.58s)]
*  you don't want it spoiled so you have to [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6044.58s)]
*  forget that because you know that something is going to be [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6046.58s)]
*  revealed. And like with a drama [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6048.58s)]
*  or comedy it's like [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6050.58s)]
*  different. So then [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6052.58s)]
*  if we know that that will always be [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6054.58s)]
*  spoiled then we have to change [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6056.58s)]
*  the way that we consume it or [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6058.58s)]
*  the way that we deliver to people. Because [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6060.58s)]
*  you can't stop the internet. Right. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6062.58s)]
*  Good luck. It's kind of [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6064.58s)]
*  impossible. It's just how we [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6066.58s)]
*  re-engineer. Having kids I [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6068.58s)]
*  think I have faith in like they're going to sort [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6070.58s)]
*  of [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6072.58s)]
*  turn their backs on it a little bit. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6074.58s)]
*  So funny. We talk about this. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6076.58s)]
*  I know. I think [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6078.58s)]
*  parents are dealing with it all the time but it's [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6080.58s)]
*  it's like [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6082.58s)]
*  a generation of like that. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6084.58s)]
*  Of like bloodites again. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6086.58s)]
*  And they're all [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6088.58s)]
*  beet farmers. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6090.58s)]
*  It's alright you know how like [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6092.58s)]
*  it's just saturation. And when you [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6094.58s)]
*  saturate someone [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6096.58s)]
*  with whatever it's like with drugs [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6098.58s)]
*  or you can go to rehab with [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6100.58s)]
*  the internet they got to get it you know. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6102.58s)]
*  I think that like our generation [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6104.58s)]
*  is obsessed with the internet. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6106.58s)]
*  And I think. Because it's new. It's new. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6108.58s)]
*  And I think children always [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6110.58s)]
*  reject the obsessions [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6112.58s)]
*  of their parents. Right. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6114.58s)]
*  And I wonder if [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6116.58s)]
*  your kids, my kids will see [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6118.58s)]
*  us on our phones all the time and be like [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6120.58s)]
*  that's what old people do. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6122.58s)]
*  Fuck that. There's going to be like a straight edge [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6124.58s)]
*  movement in social content. I [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6126.58s)]
*  genuinely believe that. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6128.58s)]
*  Kids it's [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6130.58s)]
*  the bottom line of like they just still [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6132.58s)]
*  want to stay connected to their friends. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6134.58s)]
*  And that's what they're the bottom line of [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6136.58s)]
*  why they're using it. For that [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6138.58s)]
*  connectivity. Which we're pushing [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6140.58s)]
*  we're putting on them all [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6142.58s)]
*  the horrible things that happen on the [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6144.58s)]
*  internet. All of that stuff. But they just [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6146.58s)]
*  want to be with their [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6148.58s)]
*  friends. You don't want to miss out on a trend [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6150.58s)]
*  that your friends know about. Or just like [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6152.58s)]
*  anything. Like how are you? Just like [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6154.58s)]
*  anything like that. You want to stay [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6156.58s)]
*  connected. I think [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6158.58s)]
*  we put on to them [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6160.58s)]
*  all the evils of it all. And [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6162.58s)]
*  they're sort of so savvy [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6164.58s)]
*  early on now that they're [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6166.58s)]
*  just like yeah I just ignore that stuff. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6168.58s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6470.58s)]
*  But I remember we would we would [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6472.58s)]
*  watching the room and the door would be open [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6474.58s)]
*  and we'd watch it with on mute. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6476.58s)]
*  And I didn't realize [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6478.58s)]
*  it would reflect off a window. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6480.58s)]
*  So my mom [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6482.58s)]
*  who just made a couple bucks. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6484.58s)]
*  One of her big splurges was when [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6486.58s)]
*  she bought the internet package, not the end of the cable package. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6488.58s)]
*  She goes, I want all the channels. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6490.58s)]
*  Thank you, mom. Thank you, mom. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6492.58s)]
*  And we were just all there, hard [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6494.58s)]
*  with the homies. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6496.58s)]
*  And my mom noticed one day [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6498.58s)]
*  walking by that the TV would reflect [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6500.58s)]
*  off of the window. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6502.58s)]
*  And then the next week we went [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6504.58s)]
*  and showed up and there was no porno for us [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6506.58s)]
*  to be hard to. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6508.58s)]
*  And yeah, it really affected our friendship. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6510.58s)]
*  So you were left with [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6512.58s)]
*  the Oxygen Network. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6514.58s)]
*  We would [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6516.58s)]
*  watch Elliot's music videos. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6518.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6522.58s)]
*  You should have gone to Jersey. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6524.58s)]
*  You should have got the Playboys. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6526.58s)]
*  What do you think of artificial [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6528.58s)]
*  intelligence in movies? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6530.58s)]
*  As far as like writing and making [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6532.58s)]
*  things inevitable? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6534.58s)]
*  Not with writing. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6536.58s)]
*  I have a couple friends who are teachers [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6538.58s)]
*  and they're navigating that landmine [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6540.58s)]
*  of students submitting papers [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6542.58s)]
*  at a high school level [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6544.58s)]
*  of English papers written [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6546.58s)]
*  by AI. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6548.58s)]
*  They're very talented writers [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6550.58s)]
*  and they are teachers [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6552.58s)]
*  and they can spot it right away. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6554.58s)]
*  But it's like we had Cliff Notes back in the day [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6556.58s)]
*  and it's like the new [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6558.58s)]
*  high tech version [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6560.58s)]
*  of what Cliff Notes were. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6562.58s)]
*  In movies [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6564.58s)]
*  it depends. I think [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6566.58s)]
*  everybody sort of treats [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6568.58s)]
*  AI like the enemy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6570.58s)]
*  And [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6572.58s)]
*  it's really [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6574.58s)]
*  not. It's a tool. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6576.58s)]
*  It's like if you have a [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6578.58s)]
*  hammer you could either [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6580.58s)]
*  build a house or kill somebody with it. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6582.58s)]
*  And it's really like it is still [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6584.58s)]
*  a tool. And I have a friend [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6586.58s)]
*  who's a really incredible visual director [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6588.58s)]
*  and he sends me like short films [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6590.58s)]
*  that he makes just with AI and they're [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6592.58s)]
*  weird and beautiful but they're definitely [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6594.58s)]
*  AI. There's nothing human about [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6596.58s)]
*  them. So I think it's [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6598.58s)]
*  really kind of cool if it's [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6600.58s)]
*  used not to [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6602.58s)]
*  lie. If it's used [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6604.58s)]
*  like a dragon. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6606.58s)]
*  It's like CGI. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6608.58s)]
*  If you CGI a dragon [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6610.58s)]
*  it's great. If you CGI a dog [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6612.58s)]
*  that's obviously a CGI dog because we know what a [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6614.58s)]
*  dog looks like and we'll always [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6616.58s)]
*  be able to tell. But [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6618.58s)]
*  if we treat it like a really cool [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6620.58s)]
*  technological tool [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6622.58s)]
*  then I'm all for it. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6624.58s)]
*  Do you think that we can write dialogue? [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6626.58s)]
*  Just don't lie with it. Just don't try and [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6628.58s)]
*  like hoodwink. Cut corners. Yeah don't try to [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6630.58s)]
*  hoodwink me as a viewer, as a human [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6632.58s)]
*  being with it. Or cut corners [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6634.58s)]
*  and like [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6636.58s)]
*  not hire [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6638.58s)]
*  a real person. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6640.58s)]
*  Do you think AI dialogue can match [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6642.58s)]
*  Cyrano? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6644.58s)]
*  No. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6646.58s)]
*  No chance. No. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6648.58s)]
*  No. No. I don't think so. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6650.58s)]
*  Because it's regurgitation. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6652.58s)]
*  It's regurgitating [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6654.58s)]
*  information that a human at the bottom line [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6656.58s)]
*  a human has given it. Yeah it can only [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6658.58s)]
*  work off what it has. It can't [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6660.58s)]
*  innovate. It can't inspire. It can't make [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6662.58s)]
*  something that's never been made. No good luck with [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6664.58s)]
*  Shakespeare AI. You know good luck. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6666.58s)]
*  All power to you but it's never going to happen. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6668.58s)]
*  Have you done Shakespeare? Yeah. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6670.58s)]
*  You did Cyrano right? Well no Cyrano [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6672.58s)]
*  is written by a very talented [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6674.58s)]
*  Frenchman. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6676.58s)]
*  Yeah I've done a bunch of Shakespeare. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6678.58s)]
*  I think there's a wife [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6680.58s)]
*  that played a role in that screenplay right? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6682.58s)]
*  Yeah she wrote Cyrano. Yeah. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6684.58s)]
*  We did it as a [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6686.58s)]
*  play. Why is it? You're incredibly talented. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6688.58s)]
*  Yeah you like to play right. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6690.58s)]
*  And you were very very when we [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6692.58s)]
*  hung out you were very humble. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6694.58s)]
*  Edmund Rustin is the French [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6696.58s)]
*  writer. Just took me a second to remember his [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6698.58s)]
*  name. But you were very humble and kind [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6700.58s)]
*  to your wife and you were like she's so unbelievably [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6702.58s)]
*  talented compared to me. That's what you [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6704.58s)]
*  said and I remember that. I thought that was very nice. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6706.58s)]
*  And you said that with nobody around. And I thought that was [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6708.58s)]
*  cool. Yeah. Well. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6710.58s)]
*  Then you said, just kidding. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6712.58s)]
*  Gotta be humble and kind. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6716.58s)]
*  Yeah I don't think that's a good question. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6718.58s)]
*  I think it's [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6720.58s)]
*  everybody's getting a little bit panicked. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6722.58s)]
*  And we've created it. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6724.58s)]
*  And we live in this [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6726.58s)]
*  sort of like Blade Runner [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6728.58s)]
*  thing of like things [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6730.58s)]
*  that they're going to take over. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6732.58s)]
*  Yes we use them all the time. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6734.58s)]
*  I've seen people compare it to Photoshop. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6736.58s)]
*  When Photoshop kind of came on the scene through Adobe [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6738.58s)]
*  there's a lot of initial pushback from artists to say [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6740.58s)]
*  like oh if you're not sketching it with hand you're not [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6742.58s)]
*  a real artist. You know you're using it as an enhancement. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6744.58s)]
*  But I do. Yes. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6746.58s)]
*  I know a lot of incredible [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6748.58s)]
*  prosthetic makeup artists. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6750.58s)]
*  And now it's sort of to age [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6752.58s)]
*  people and de-age them. And it's [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6754.58s)]
*  creepy. And it doesn't [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6756.58s)]
*  have the same impact that an incredible [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6758.58s)]
*  prosthetic artist does to add [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6760.58s)]

*  De-aging is harder. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6764.58s)]
*  But you know [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6766.58s)]
*  I think [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6768.58s)]
*  that's sort of faith [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6770.58s)]
*  looking too. Dove brought up a good point. I think [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6772.58s)]
*  this is a not to continue [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6774.58s)]

*  there's a you can [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6780.58s)]
*  tell when sets are [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6782.58s)]
*  created and sets are real. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6784.58s)]
*  I don't know why you can tell. Because you're [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6786.58s)]
*  you have a brain. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6788.58s)]
*  But my brain should look [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6790.58s)]
*  at these things that are created digitally but they look [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6792.58s)]
*  almost perfect. And you [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6794.58s)]
*  had an interesting point which is like in [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6796.58s)]
*  a real set it offers [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6798.58s)]
*  more movement. You can like walk about [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6800.58s)]
*  the room. That's the thing. They're trying to make it perfect [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6802.58s)]
*  and nothing's perfect. And [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6804.58s)]
*  it's great for deep [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6806.58s)]
*  I can speak to this better than I can. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6808.58s)]
*  But it's great for like really [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6810.58s)]
*  deep background. But like [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6812.58s)]
*  the stuff in the room. You can't do it. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6814.58s)]
*  It's sort of ridiculous because it's actually [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6816.58s)]
*  more expensive than actually going and shooting [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6818.58s)]
*  a real set. You're saying building out the [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6820.58s)]
*  artificial sets. It's ridiculous. It's so [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6822.58s)]
*  expensive. Because they because [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6824.58s)]
*  CGI artists know that [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6826.58s)]
*  hey me. Because now it's a thing. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6828.58s)]
*  Play the Mandalorian. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6830.58s)]
*  Yes. It's all shot on [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6832.58s)]
*  a virtual set. And it just looks. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6834.58s)]
*  But you know it. Not to put it's a great [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6836.58s)]
*  show. But you can tell that it's not [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6838.58s)]
*  real. It's not tactile. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6840.58s)]
*  But that's okay [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6842.58s)]
*  because it takes place on different planets [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6844.58s)]
*  in a way. A little bit. More is [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6846.58s)]
*  forgiven. It's not okay. Yeah you get away with more. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6848.58s)]
*  But more is forgiven. It's thick. It looks [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6850.58s)]
*  it. You see it. Like [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6852.58s)]
*  I'm not even trying to promote it. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6854.58s)]
*  You will see it. And it will [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6856.58s)]
*  instantly feel cold. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6858.58s)]
*  I think it affects the actors subconsciously as [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6860.58s)]
*  well. 100 percent. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6862.58s)]
*  If you are cold you [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6864.58s)]
*  don't have to act cold. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6866.58s)]
*  And you can think about acting whatever the role [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6868.58s)]
*  is and getting the emotion. You know like those things [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6870.58s)]
*  that are done for you. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6872.58s)]
*  Whereas if you're on a set with a screen behind [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6874.58s)]
*  you there's so many things to calculate. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6876.58s)]
*  All the great filmmakers prefer [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6878.58s)]
*  real locations to being on [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6880.58s)]
*  a stage. Yeah. I think it [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6882.58s)]
*  was easy. For some things, interior [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6884.58s)]
*  is great. Boom. But [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6886.58s)]
*  even that I'd rather shoot in a real restaurant [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6888.58s)]
*  and shut it down for the day and have like [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6890.58s)]
*  I don't know. It just feels like [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6892.58s)]
*  people have sat here where I'm sitting and ordered. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6894.58s)]
*  It feels like a soap opera when it's fake. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6896.58s)]
*  For whatever reason. Yeah. When it's real [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6898.58s)]
*  I lose myself in it. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6900.58s)]
*  I believe it. I can believe [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6902.58s)]
*  the absurdity. I can believe [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6904.58s)]
*  a fucking. I can believe the fantasy. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6906.58s)]
*  I can believe a fucking dragon when the castle's [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6908.58s)]
*  real. When it feels like [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6910.58s)]
*  the background might be artificial [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6912.58s)]
*  and every stone is like perfectly laid. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6914.58s)]
*  I don't know if I can tell the difference to be honest [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6916.58s)]
*  with you but I can definitely see it affecting the acting. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6918.58s)]
*  To your point. You can tell the [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6920.58s)]
*  difference. You don't know you can tell the difference. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6922.58s)]
*  Maybe I can. I don't know. I can't think of examples [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6924.58s)]
*  where I think it was fake. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6926.58s)]
*  I didn't know that it was cheaper [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6928.58s)]
*  to actually go to location. If [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6930.58s)]
*  that's the case why does everybody. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6932.58s)]
*  I mean it's called a volume stage. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6934.58s)]
*  And you have to go out [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6936.58s)]
*  and you have to shoot the background plates in order [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6938.58s)]
*  to do it. And then you create like Batman. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6940.58s)]
*  The new Batman. We're at Patterson that was all shot. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6942.58s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6944.58s)]
*  Matt Reeves. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6946.58s)]
*  All volume stage. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6948.58s)]
*  I thought that looked good though. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6950.58s)]
*  But you're talking about [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6952.58s)]
*  like 200 million dollars. Got it. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6954.58s)]
*  So you need to spend that type of money to make it. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6956.58s)]
*  Wow. I mean [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6958.58s)]
*  can you even. And that's the whole [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6960.58s)]
*  thing of like indie movies are trying to [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6962.58s)]
*  you know. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6964.58s)]
*  How do you compete with that? So what about [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6966.58s)]
*  this idea? You don't have that facility. So you gotta [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6968.58s)]
*  go real and then it feels. And it feels. Again. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6970.58s)]
*  It feels better. Okay. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6972.58s)]
*  You were part of the golden [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6974.58s)]
*  age of television. And [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6976.58s)]
*  some people say the golden age of television basically happened [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6978.58s)]
*  because movie budgets skyrocketed [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6980.58s)]
*  to the point where they couldn't take chances. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6982.58s)]
*  And they had to only do these 300 million [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6984.58s)]
*  dollar existing IP films [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6986.58s)]
*  that were guaranteed success. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6988.58s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the beautiful [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6990.58s)]
*  stories that were maybe adapted from books [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6992.58s)]
*  ended up thriving on television. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6994.58s)]
*  That's what some people say. Now [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6996.58s)]
*  that movies, these 300 dollar movies [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=6998.58s)]
*  aren't necessarily making money, they're losing money. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7000.58s)]
*  Do you think that the studios [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7002.58s)]
*  will start making the [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7004.58s)]
*  20 million dollar film [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7006.58s)]
*  in an effort to profit? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7008.58s)]
*  And now we live in the golden age of film. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7010.58s)]
*  It's [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7012.58s)]
*  I don't know whether it's low tide or high tide. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7014.58s)]
*  After our show everybody wanted [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7016.58s)]
*  to spend a lot of money because they thought [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7018.58s)]
*  that's how you make a lot of money. And then [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7020.58s)]
*  there was the feeding frenzy [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7022.58s)]
*  Netflix and Amazon. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7024.58s)]
*  And all those people, everybody was like spending, spending, spending. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7026.58s)]
*  And I think a large part due to Thrones. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7028.58s)]
*  And then [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7030.58s)]
*  it didn't work out for a lot of [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7032.58s)]
*  them. So they went, nope, we're not spending any [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7034.58s)]
*  money anymore. And so then you're going [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7036.58s)]
*  all of us on the creative end of things go [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7038.58s)]
*  just have to keep up with their [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7040.58s)]
*  expectations. Yeah. And their [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7042.58s)]
*  budget. Their slate and all that stuff. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7044.58s)]
*  So it's sort of like, what do you guys [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7046.58s)]
*  what's the flavor now? And how can we help? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7048.58s)]
*  And we're just, we want to entertain people. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7050.58s)]
*  And [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7052.58s)]
*  I kind of feel like you want to be really hard. And it's [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7054.58s)]
*  but that's it's like it's like politics in this [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7056.58s)]
*  country. We're never satisfied. We never would. The pendulum [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7058.58s)]
*  is just swinging back and forth. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7060.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7062.58s)]
*  So there is no formula. It's [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7064.58s)]
*  just real. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7066.58s)]
*  Whatever is [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7068.58s)]
*  popular. We follow that [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7070.58s)]
*  popular crowd. Everybody's chasing [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7072.58s)]
*  what's successful. Yeah. But with that [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7074.58s)]
*  you sacrifice [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7076.58s)]
*  risk and creativity and all that stuff. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7078.58s)]
*  Is there a story that you [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7080.58s)]
*  would want to tell or movie or a film you'd want to [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7082.58s)]
*  make that just like either hasn't been made or [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7084.58s)]
*  couldn't be made given the restrictions? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7086.58s)]
*  Oh, there's a billion [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7088.58s)]
*  of them. But I don't [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7090.58s)]
*  know until I read them. You mean what [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7092.58s)]
*  story I want to tell? Yeah. Has there been [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7094.58s)]
*  anything in your mind recently that you're like, oh, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7096.58s)]
*  I would love to see this. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7098.58s)]
*  Well, I just love like [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7100.58s)]
*  challenging. Like in South Korea [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7102.58s)]
*  they challenge. While [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7104.58s)]
*  South Korean films are so great, they [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7106.58s)]
*  challenge genres. Like [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7108.58s)]
*  you can watch a horror movie [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7110.58s)]
*  that can leave you in tears. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7112.58s)]
*  Like an action [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7114.58s)]
*  movie that just is so beautifully dramatic. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7116.58s)]
*  Like they don't, [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7118.58s)]
*  they're not. And thank God we've sort of [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7120.58s)]
*  had them come [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7122.58s)]
*  into our, they've become popular [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7124.58s)]
*  in our country. Parasite was huge. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7126.58s)]
*  Parasite, yes. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7128.58s)]
*  Because I just like the idea [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7130.58s)]
*  of defining [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7132.58s)]
*  genres. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7134.58s)]
*  I think Jordan Peele does that really well. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7136.58s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say that. It's like so good. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7138.58s)]
*  But they've been doing it before [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7140.58s)]
*  Jordan Peele for a long time. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7142.58s)]
*  And, but people in our, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7144.58s)]
*  I'll say it, maybe in our country they just [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7146.58s)]
*  get sort of like, well, what kind of movie is it? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7148.58s)]
*  How many rotten tomatoes did it get? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7150.58s)]
*  I need to know what I'm seeing. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7152.58s)]
*  Yeah. I think Pixar does. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7154.58s)]
*  I don't ever, ever want to know what I'm [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7156.58s)]
*  about to see. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7158.58s)]
*  Pixar is incredible. Yeah. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7160.58s)]
*  And I think they define the genre where you're like, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7162.58s)]
*  oh, I'm just going to go see the little kids cartoon. And you [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7164.58s)]
*  walk away being like, what the fuck was that? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7166.58s)]
*  Why did they just do that in the first 10 minutes of [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7168.58s)]
*  opt? Why can [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7170.58s)]
*  I not move? Yeah. Yeah. Why are [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7172.58s)]
*  they courageous? No, I mean [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7174.58s)]
*  that genuinely. Like, why do you think they are so [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7176.58s)]
*  brave where everybody is? Because the kids are more open than we are. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7178.58s)]
*  Dude, that might be it. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7180.58s)]
*  They, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7182.58s)]
*  that might be it. I don't know. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7184.58s)]
*  They might be more willing. Shrek [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7186.58s)]
*  was another one that really like flipped all that stuff [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7188.58s)]
*  on its head. It's like the princess [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7190.58s)]
*  stayed the ogre at the end. Yeah. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7192.58s)]
*  They've done, they've defined what I was just talking about. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7194.58s)]
*  I'm like, kids movies, movies for adults. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7196.58s)]
*  WALL-E [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7198.58s)]
*  I saw that before [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7200.58s)]
*  I had kids. It's one of the greatest [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7202.58s)]
*  movies I think ever made. And there's [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7204.58s)]
*  no fucking dialogue. It's like if Stanley Kubrick [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7206.58s)]
*  made an animated movie. That movie, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7208.58s)]
*  WALL-E is like [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7210.58s)]
*  still one of my top five movies [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7212.58s)]
*  of all time and it's an animated kids movie. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7214.58s)]
*  But it's not a kids, it's so good. Yeah. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7216.58s)]
*  Yeah. Duke, have you [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7218.58s)]
*  watched it with your kids? Yeah. And do they [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7220.58s)]
*  appreciate it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7222.58s)]
*  Yeah. It transcends. And are they getting [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7224.58s)]
*  the point of the film? Like [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7226.58s)]
*  Yeah. Of course. They get everything. Yeah. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7228.58s)]
*  Because it gets kind of deep towards the [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7230.58s)]
*  end. It's what happens when you pacify [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7232.58s)]
*  a group of people and just give them the most [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7234.58s)]
*  convenient thing. That's our perception. They don't, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7236.58s)]
*  they get something else. They get something. Yeah. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7238.58s)]
*  I do notice, the only thing I do notice is [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7240.58s)]
*  the pace in which these movies [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7242.58s)]
*  are go. What does that mean? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7244.58s)]
*  We saw Inside Out. They all have like a [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7246.58s)]
*  a pace of like [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7248.58s)]
*  I showed them E.T. a couple years ago. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7250.58s)]
*  Yeah. Like [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7252.58s)]
*  it's funny because you watch E.T. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7254.58s)]
*  as an adult and you're like, well this movie [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7256.58s)]
*  is all about divorce. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7258.58s)]
*  It's not about the alien at all. It's not at all. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7260.58s)]
*  It's all about divorce and [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7262.58s)]
*  the kids suffering from it and the [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7264.58s)]
*  mom. But [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7266.58s)]
*  they thought it was just like kind of slow. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7268.58s)]
*  And I think it's no fault of [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7270.58s)]
*  theirs. It's just we live at a speed. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7272.58s)]
*  I saw Taxi Driver with [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7274.58s)]
*  your little kids. With Daenerys. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7276.58s)]
*  Yeah. I showed them [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7278.58s)]
*  I showed them the Schindler's List. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7280.58s)]
*  They're like, God! [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7282.58s)]
*  We need a factor! Why would you save it? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7284.58s)]
*  What's wrong with the Nazis? [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7286.58s)]
*  No. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7288.58s)]
*  The Dorn of Interest was a big hit with them. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7290.58s)]
*  That [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7292.58s)]
*  You know that is a great [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7294.58s)]
*  point. Pace. They're used to such [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7296.58s)]
*  fast pace. Yeah. And the older [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7298.58s)]
*  films are much [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7300.58s)]
*  slower. Yeah. But they [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7302.58s)]
*  build in a way that the newer [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7304.58s)]
*  ones where you don't have the attention [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7306.58s)]
*  spanned don't. So like if you [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7308.58s)]
*  give ET a little bit of time, all of a sudden [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7310.58s)]
*  you're really fucking invested in the story. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7312.58s)]
*  But like you said, it's not about the dragons. It's not about [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7314.58s)]
*  the alien. Yeah. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7316.58s)]
*  Yeah. It's about this like turmoil in the family. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7318.58s)]
*  Which is probably the most relatable thing [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7320.58s)]
*  to people and kids growing up at that time. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7322.58s)]
*  For sure. Divorce getting super [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7324.58s)]
*  popular. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7326.58s)]
*  But I didn't see any of that when I was a kid. None of it. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7328.58s)]
*  I just saw, oh my God. I saw [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7330.58s)]

*  Yeah. M&M's turned them down. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7334.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7336.58s)]
*  You idiots. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7338.58s)]
*  Nobody turns down Spielberg. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7340.58s)]
*  That's insane. What makes Spielberg [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7342.58s)]
*  special? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7344.58s)]
*  Man. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7346.58s)]
*  That innocence. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7348.58s)]
*  Human condition? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7350.58s)]
*  That idea of like it's not, it doesn't, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7352.58s)]
*  well especially with the movies that I grew up [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7354.58s)]
*  with, Close Encounters, which still is one of [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7356.58s)]
*  my favorite movies of all time. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7358.58s)]
*  It doesn't talk down to the kids. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7360.58s)]
*  It makes them just right there with [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7362.58s)]
*  everybody else. Treats the children [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7364.58s)]
*  like adults. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7366.58s)]
*  Well just like smart. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7368.58s)]
*  They can solve problems. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7370.58s)]
*  Yeah. And he just has like a [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7372.58s)]
*  hope. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7374.58s)]
*  I'm such a cynical fuck, but [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7376.58s)]
*  I need to go to the movies for [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7378.58s)]
*  hope. Like something's good [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7380.58s)]
*  about people. And he's always done [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7382.58s)]
*  that. And not in a saccharine way, but in like [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7384.58s)]
*  a real beautiful artist, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7386.58s)]
*  beautiful artist way. And all [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7388.58s)]
*  the great artists. Jaws. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7390.58s)]
*  Fellini. Everybody. Hope. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7392.58s)]
*  But Jaws is hope too. It's like this working [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7394.58s)]
*  class, like [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7396.58s)]
*  run of the meal. The nuance of family. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7398.58s)]
*  The nuance of like sitting around a kitchen [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7400.58s)]
*  table without like making [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7402.58s)]
*  it feel product placement [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7404.58s)]
*  or something. Mundane. Yeah. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7406.58s)]
*  And it's also, it's weird because it's sort of, [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7408.58s)]
*  I think about that sometimes. I'm like, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7410.58s)]
*  we grew up with his films. Did they define [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7412.58s)]
*  our childhood? Or did I [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7414.58s)]
*  have a childhood and Spielberg [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7416.58s)]
*  was a part of it? Because I was obsessed with [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7418.58s)]
*  movies from a very young age. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7420.58s)]
*  And Spielberg in the 70s, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7422.58s)]
*  for my childhood, he was like, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7424.58s)]
*  did he gear my childhood? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7426.58s)]
*  It's funny. It's like that's how deep it runs [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7428.58s)]
*  because it came at that age. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7430.58s)]
*  So you're looking at your childhood and your [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7432.58s)]
*  family dynamic through the lens. Mom and dad, why [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7434.58s)]
*  aren't you getting divorced? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7436.58s)]
*  Well, you love each other. We'd have a fucking alien if you just [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7438.58s)]
*  hated each other. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7440.58s)]
*  I'm trying to build character. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7442.58s)]
*  Okay, so Spielberg, master at that. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7444.58s)]
*  Anybody else outside of Elliot [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7446.58s)]
*  or Elliot included. But I have a real cynical [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7448.58s)]
*  side going through me too. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7450.58s)]
*  Kubrick was asked [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7452.58s)]
*  because, did you [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7454.58s)]
*  maybe know this story? He's like, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7456.58s)]
*  he was asked, why would [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7460.58s)]
*  you make, because he's Jewish. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7462.58s)]
*  Stanley Kubrick, the greatest filmmaker of all time. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7464.58s)]
*  Don't hold it against him. Spielberg's also [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7466.58s)]
*  a favorite filmmaker of all time. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7468.58s)]
*  He was asked, what did you ever think about making a Holocaust [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7470.58s)]
*  movie? And he said, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7472.58s)]
*  I don't make comedies. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7474.58s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7484.58s)]
*  Why do you say it's impossible? Because apparently it's like really [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7486.58s)]
*  bad what happened. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7488.58s)]
*  And they said, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7490.58s)]
*  what about Schindler's List? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7492.58s)]
*  And he said, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7494.58s)]
*  Schindler's List [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7496.58s)]
*  was about, I don't know the number, 850 [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7498.58s)]
*  people surviving. The Holocaust [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7500.58s)]
*  was about 6 million people dying. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7502.58s)]
*  So as great a [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7504.58s)]
*  film as Schindler's List is, it still had [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7506.58s)]
*  that hope. Like it was about [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7508.58s)]
*  survival. And [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7510.58s)]
*  I want to see Kubrick's version. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7512.58s)]
*  It's too late now, but like [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7514.58s)]
*  about, like, there's [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7516.58s)]
*  no happy ending here. You know what I mean? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7518.58s)]
*  And it's like, yes, we need [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7520.58s)]
*  the hope. We need the [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7522.58s)]
*  that. But [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7524.58s)]
*  yeah. That was his version [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7526.58s)]
*  of that and why he didn't do it. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7528.58s)]
*  Like what you see in a story [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7530.58s)]
*  is interesting. You want to, you're [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7532.58s)]
*  cynical, so you want to see the best versions of [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7534.58s)]
*  humanity. You want to, and [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7536.58s)]
*  it reminds you like, okay, I'm a little cynical, [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7538.58s)]
*  but you know what? There are, there is some good shit [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7540.58s)]
*  out there in the world and it's worth pushing through [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7542.58s)]
*  and life is awesome. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7544.58s)]
*  And, yeah. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7546.58s)]
*  Because I get, I take, because I get sort of [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7548.58s)]
*  bombarded with a lot of weird shit [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7550.58s)]
*  on a day to day basis living here in the city. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7552.58s)]
*  And if I get one, [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7554.58s)]
*  it makes it okay [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7556.58s)]
*  if I get one like, one [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7558.58s)]

*  when you're in the public eye. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7566.58s)]
*  Blanche D'Aubure, I've always depended on the kindness [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7568.58s)]
*  of strangers. Streetcar [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7570.58s)]

*  It's not woe is me at all. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7596.58s)]
*  But I rarely get it from [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7598.58s)]

*  Because we're living in [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7636.58s)]
*  wild tops. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7638.58s)]
*  Whoa. I don't think people are aware [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7640.58s)]
*  that again we did have a civil war [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7642.58s)]
*  not so long ago [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7644.58s)]
*  in the grand scheme of [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7646.58s)]
*  how long people have been around. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7648.58s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7650.58s)]
*  I do think we are a little [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7652.58s)]
*  like numb or desensitized. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7654.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7656.58s)]
*  Which happened in Europe a while ago too. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7658.58s)]
*  What happened around then? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7660.58s)]
*  I don't know. Nothing bad probably. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7662.58s)]
*  The Thicket in theaters. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7664.58s)]

*  Any lasting [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7674.58s)]
*  last thoughts. You gave this great speech [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7676.58s)]
*  at your college and I thought it was really cool. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7678.58s)]
*  You wanted that. You wanted more of that. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7680.58s)]
*  I wanted exactly what [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7682.58s)]
*  you gave today. Director Schultz. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7684.58s)]
*  Just hanging out with you [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7686.58s)]
*  I was like I hope we get the guy that I [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7688.58s)]
*  hung out with which I thought you gave us. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7690.58s)]
*  Get rid of these cameras. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7692.58s)]
*  Yeah. I thought you brought it [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7694.58s)]
*  even with the cameras. But I really thought [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7696.58s)]
*  that you had some great advice for these kids. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7698.58s)]
*  And it felt like you actually really cared about your college. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7700.58s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people care about their college experience. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7702.58s)]
*  But I thought you did. Yeah I really don't. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7704.58s)]
*  And I thought it was really cool. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7706.58s)]
*  You didn't. It wasn't [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7708.58s)]
*  impactful to you. But you fucking enjoyed [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7710.58s)]
*  I didn't enjoy my college. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7712.58s)]
*  No your college. You didn't enjoy [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7714.58s)]
*  going. But it felt like you valued [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7716.58s)]
*  your time at your school. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7718.58s)]
*  I wish I did. I wish I valued my time [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7720.58s)]
*  in high school more. Interesting. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7722.58s)]
*  The hindsight is 20-20. We all have [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7724.58s)]
*  regrets. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7726.58s)]
*  But [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7728.58s)]
*  no I just it's just again [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7730.58s)]
*  they look they are all so young and it's [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7732.58s)]
*  like wow that's such a [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7734.58s)]
*  it's such a [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7736.58s)]
*  you're at such a fork in the road [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7738.58s)]
*  at that age. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7740.58s)]
*  And you can go down [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7742.58s)]
*  any number of paths and [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7744.58s)]
*  I was just trying to speak to [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7746.58s)]
*  don't worry about making mistakes. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7748.58s)]
*  I thought yeah. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7750.58s)]
*  Because mistakes are everything. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7752.58s)]
*  They're maybe more important than like [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7754.58s)]
*  things that you don't think are mistakes. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7756.58s)]
*  Fail. Fail again. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7758.58s)]
*  I got that tattoo on my back. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7760.58s)]
*  Beckett my favorite writer. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7762.58s)]
*  It's all about like failing. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7764.58s)]
*  And what is it? [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7766.58s)]
*  Ever tried ever failed. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7768.58s)]
*  It's a fail again [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7770.58s)]
*  but fail better. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7772.58s)]
*  Because there's no like perfection. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7774.58s)]
*  It's just failing better. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7776.58s)]
*  That's what we do for a living. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7778.58s)]
*  We just trust that every time out of the gates [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7780.58s)]
*  we're going to make something great. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7782.58s)]
*  But it's all about failing better. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7784.58s)]
*  And it sounds cynical but it's really not. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7786.58s)]
*  Just about [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7788.58s)]
*  failing better. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7790.58s)]
*  And I like that contradiction of terms too. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7792.58s)]
*  What do you mean? Failing better. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7794.58s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yeah if the expectation [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7796.58s)]
*  is almost like hey this is this might not [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7798.58s)]
*  work out but it might work a little better than the last [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7800.58s)]
*  time you tried. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7802.58s)]
*  And differently too. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7804.58s)]
*  But again it's all about [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7806.58s)]
*  just faith in each other and all that stuff. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3s1iS5O1c&t=7808.58s)]
