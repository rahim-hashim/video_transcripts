*  Yeah, he's dropped out of the race. We were gonna have Vivek Rama Swami on and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=14.8s)]
*  You know, he got his pipe packed in Iowa and now he's not gonna be able to come on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=20.64s)]

*  We're good. He got his pipe packed. It's like like I don't when the fudge monkeys stuff your fart box [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=33.88s)]
*  You never [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=42.2s)]
*  I'm just annoyed about the timing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=47.28s)]
*  Yeah, do you know what I mean? Like we wouldn't you can tell us like last night. Yeah, it's just annoying [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=50.36s)]
*  We could have planned something else out. We're already pushing the episode back to Wednesday [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  By the way, Wednesday episodes was gonna be from now on this is absolutely incredible [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=59.56s)]
*  Come back from the road have a whole day to prepare build out a nice episode do all this research just for some fucking [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=63.6s)]
*  Bravo to not show up [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=71.12s)]
*  He was supposed to be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=73.12s)]
*  Unbelievable unbelievable. I think the SEC should look into him. There's no way [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=76.0s)]
*  IRS we the SEC I need to go to Bermuda and look at some bank accounts [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  What's going on with this fucking guy so I'm trying to get through his book woke ink [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=85.6s)]
*  I think this the whole book was written with the idea that I'm gonna run for president another question [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  I want to be somewhere in the periphery of Trump's power [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  I always thought the VEC was trying to get a cabinet position or maybe VP. Mm-hmm [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=97.88s)]
*  I genuinely believe that I still think I don't think Trump would ever have somebody next to him. It's more eloquent more intelligent [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=102.0s)]
*  Looks like they could potentially do the job better because it's the same thing as having a star [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  Backup quarterback the second you're starting quarterback makes a few bad decisions. What does the newspaper say? Yeah [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=115.6s)]
*  Well, let's get cam Newton off the bench. Give cam Newton a try. Who's the black dude that did it was a brain surgeon Carson? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=121.64s)]
*  Ben Carson remember like something even a cabinet position. He's like yo figure out where the cars go or something [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Made him a valet [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=135.28s)]
*  Let's get Ben Carson on it. I would have been cars put us all asleep within five minutes. Yeah [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=138.2s)]
*  This is what's funny he's maybe the greatest surgeon in the history of humanity. He's incredible. Do you believe that shit son? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=143.96s)]
*  I read his book before he ran this guy did like historic surgeries anywhere got Pizza Hut or something to shit [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=149.88s)]
*  Or that was somebody else. No, you like work that poppy shot first guy to separate Siamese twins [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=154.8s)]
*  I think they were connected at the head or something like that successful surgery like the guys [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=159.78s)]
*  Historically great. How is that hard? I don't understand together. Sometimes you ask how is that hard? Yeah to ridiculous things [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=163.8s)]
*  I don't see why that's hard. There are things that are hard. I don't see how that's okay [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, get hit the science real quick. I'm not even talking about science. Have you ever seen a chicken breast? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Okay, and you know how a chicken breast is butterfly. Yeah, so essentially there's two equal parts of chicken breast [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Where do you cut it? Do you cut it down one third? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=186.84s)]
*  Do you cut it down the fuck you think the big mystery is where do we cut the Siamese? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=189.44s)]
*  It has to be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  Easily do that. I would know because it's one central nervous system [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=196.32s)]
*  I [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=200.76s)]
*  Y'all can't read XA's there's clearly one listen the cranial pegas twins have one central nervous [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  Is this the one this case is this the one Ben Carson course? It's not of course not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  There's one central fucking nervous system is not possible. But if you go to the yin-yang twins right there [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Those I can separate I could easily separate the yin-yang twins [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=219.72s)]
*  I could give a bit of baseball cap, but you would know the fucking difference [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=223.2s)]
*  Now if you go back to Jaga and Balia down there, they're the conjoined twins they got separated I could do this shit easily [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=226.04s)]
*  I'm not playing around son. Keep them together. It's better. I agree with you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  They're more interesting that way you could either be a wonky headed weirdo by yourself or you could be a conjoined twin [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  You could be a superstar [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=244.64s)]
*  Why don't you find the Ben Carson ones if they don't exist? He didn't do it [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=245.72s)]
*  That's the thing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  He was doing these surgeries at a time where like nothing was written down [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=250.11999999999998s)]
*  Like anybody could claim that they did surgeries back in the day look at him [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  What is he holding? He's holding a piggy bank. It's a piggy bank this guy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=256.68s)]
*  No way. He's gonna cut that open and pennies are gonna fall out [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=261.2s)]
*  There's no way in hell that he actually did the surgery. I need to speak to the kids [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=263.96s)]
*  Why weren't they out there supporting him? Why weren't they in an interview saying? Hey, oh my god [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=268.24s)]
*  My life is so much better after he cut us in half. I'll tell you what see out there. They're not getting pussy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=273.14s)]
*  Okay, they're out there Stephen Hawking and themselves around with fucking saliva everywhere because he just chopped straight through [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=277.8s)]
*  Ginsu style and he didn't make their life any better if he had left them conjoined these guys probably would have went to MIT [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=284.32s)]
*  two brains [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=290.12s)]
*  Brain why are we not having conjoined twins make all our decisions? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=292.64s)]
*  This is a great idea. They could give the conjoined twins ran for president. That would be kind of fire, bro [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=296.88s)]
*  Get me to fucking to prove their life. I'm looking at a live in a half [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=302.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, Schultz might have might be right on of course. I'm right. Why do you believe everything? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=306.68s)]
*  Hang on. Hang on. I don't believe everything. Oh [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=312.2s)]
*  I'm a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=315.12s)]
*  Tired black guy. I could do conjoined twin brain surgery and we're just supposed to believe no he did it [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=317.04s)]
*  He did do it. He did do it with what we laid him on a train track [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=324.16s)]
*  Okay, and he let it slice him over and of course whatever was left they get to go about their day [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=328.04s)]
*  But it's not like they're going to fucking Yale after you chop them apart [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=333.84s)]

*  So we're not even at the craziest part in March 2013 Carson announced that he would retire his surgeon saying that he would quote [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=518.44s)]

*  There's no easier job than being a doctor of some shit that hasn't been discovered yet [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=537.08s)]
*  Because you got no precedence for the success of it [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=542.84s)]
*  being [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=546.2800000000001s)]

*  Because you can never do it successfully [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=554.52s)]

*  Now when I was a high school we went to a Bible study and people started speaking in tongues I [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1252.0s)]
*  Like it wasn't Cali was like even like a Pentecostal church or whatever. So when Jamaicans do it, it's cool [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1256.56s)]

*  It's just like this. He was like I didn't know I wasn't trying to troll. I was just having fun or something like that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1330.74s)]
*  I didn't mean to offend anybody. No, you know its views [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1335.44s)]
*  You know the Christians are gonna get all fucking upset about it. Absolutely trolling and then he was said something like [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1338.24s)]
*  Yeah, I've read an article about his apology said something like I'm not the first rapper to dress like Jesus and I won't be the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1344.02s)]
*  Last and it's like yeah, but you are the first rapper to dress like Jesus on the crucifix with fucking cheerleader boots [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1349.72s)]

*  But don't act like this is something people have done before and you weren't you're a troll [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1362.7s)]
*  But one of the great things about the Judeo-Christian values of the United States of America is you can do something like this [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1365.56s)]
*  And you won't get thrown off a building [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1370.1s)]
*  Also, there's a movie [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1372.8999999999999s)]
*  That is awesome [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1374.46s)]
*  Say it depends on what state he goes [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1378.26s)]
*  I don't think they can legally throw them off buildings in any state in the United States [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1380.98s)]
*  Well Nas X tour probably like eight states and that's it. That's true [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1384.3s)]
*  And there might be people that get very upset about it [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1388.58s)]
*  But technically speaking it is not legal for them to go to the top floor of the highest building and toss his gas off of it [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1390.58s)]
*  It's not legal where there are countries where they specifically build buildings for this reason [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1396.98s)]
*  No, no you look at those like there's these like [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1407.22s)]

*  It's just cut off for me if you're a gay dude traveling. Yeah, he was like, yeah, I wouldn't go to Jamaica [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1456.54s)]

*  It's illegal to exist. But why would they know you're gay? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1467.66s)]
*  Well, then, you know, they got supreme gaydar over there too, I guess they do I guess like if you really want to go to [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1472.7800000000002s)]
*  A place I wouldn't let your sexual proclivities stop you from doing that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=1478.18s)]

*  Like I literally I told him that I was like dude that that is like a dangerous amount of power right there [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2789.72s)]
*  Like like if he said jump off the balcony, I 100% promise [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2795.0s)]
*  But no, it's like he did something at the end that I thought was really cool [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2803.72s)]
*  It was you know, the song fiend that he has feigned with him and Cardi, right? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2807.16s)]
*  They're feeding for more or whatever that shit is and then he the beat drops and she goes fiend fiend. So he plays it [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2811.32s)]
*  While he looks around in the audience for interesting couples or people and then [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2818.76s)]
*  He kind of points them out and he goes I know that person right there [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2825.28s)]
*  How old do you know the kids like I'm 14 years old or something like that? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2829.88s)]
*  And then this was actually a funny moment. He goes and you're here by yourself. He goes damn everybody's tell you [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2832.76s)]
*  It's 14 years old here by yourself. I love that and we were like [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2837.0200000000004s)]
*  And then he goes he goes yeah, I think this kid right here is feeding for more [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2842.5200000000004s)]
*  And then it drops and the kids going crazy and he does that with interesting groups [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2847.24s)]
*  It was a dad and his son his son is 12. His dad is 50 [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2851.56s)]
*  He goes we got a 50 year old here [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2855.06s)]
*  I know he's feeding for more and the kid and the dad are going and they're on the jumbotron as well [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2856.4399999999996s)]
*  It's more he made the whole place feel so small. So it's super connectivity and also a moment [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2860.72s)]
*  like for [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2868.0s)]
*  That person. Yeah, I remember I saw Jay do this back in the day points out what people are wearing [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2869.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and he kind of like it's almost like a rose but he's acknowledging them like I've seen this girl going for you in the [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2874.0s)]
*  Blouse that are you going crazy and you have a moment with Jay what I like about this is you have a moment with your [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2880.28s)]
*  Favorite musician and then the whole crowd sings for your moment. Yeah [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2886.8s)]
*  So it's like you you get to be Travis for a second [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2893.32s)]
*  Wow, and it's like and he played the same song [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2896.92s)]
*  maybe eight times or something at the end and [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2900.48s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't like okay [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2904.12s)]
*  I'm over this as long as the people he picked out were interesting or the story was interesting for some reason [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2906.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, okay. I want to see this go down. Yeah, it was a 50 year old dad and the 12 year old kid [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2913.2799999999997s)]
*  It was the kid was so excited. Yeah, and every person had their own little moment [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  It was so cool [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2923.44s)]
*  And it was just like he really curates the live show and I think this is something that like a lot of rappers fuck up [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2924.0s)]
*  Is they don't try to make the live show which is the thing that they make the most fucking money at as [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2929.8s)]
*  Dynamic as it can be and lean into the type of music they're making and create that experience that those people need to have [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2938.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because you see some he's like, oh my god, this is the most boring fucking show ever seen in my life [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2944.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but he's always been one of those artists that he puts so much effort into like, yeah since the beginning of his career [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2948.7200000000003s)]
*  He's always been known like yo his live show is not and he he's cool like he's objectively cool [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2955.56s)]
*  But he doesn't try to make the whole experience too cool [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2961.12s)]
*  Like there's moments where he's pulling people and putting them on like these moving [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2965.2s)]
*  Like like risers that are like floating throughout the arena and he's not just like only picking like bad bitches to bring up [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2968.48s)]
*  He's like yo that guy in the crutches. That's a real fan shirt off with crutches [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2974.68s)]
*  Yeah up here and it brings a dude with crutches up on the thing and then like there's a dude with a shirt on [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2978.38s)]
*  He's in his underwear and instead of him being like yo, that's us. He's like, yo that guy [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2982.94s)]
*  I need more of that that guy's feeding for more and like [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2986.96s)]
*  What's crazy is that was a stadium show in an arena cuz he did that same show at so fine [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2990.86s)]
*  LA was 70,000 people so when you're in the arena and he covers the entire floor in this like [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=2995.56s)]
*  Tempo is the set it looks like what is that? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3001.02s)]
*  But it puts him close to everyone in the arena this way so let's say this thing right here is the arena [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3007.32s)]
*  and [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3013.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is the floor like this is where the Knicks would play [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3014.46s)]
*  This is where all the seats would be for like Scotiabank. Yeah, almost that whole section is [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3017.0s)]
*  His set there's a little trim that like people that have like the floor access can go around [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3022.6600000000003s)]
*  But there's only maybe a few hundred people on the floor [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3029.02s)]
*  So most people are seated and he's walking around the set and there's like all these elevated components in the set [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3031.78s)]
*  So he's kind of always in your visual and people can kind of follow him around [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3037.86s)]
*  but um [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3042.38s)]
*  Yeah, it was just like it was extreme attention to detail to the show like not to compare it to to Taylor [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3044.1200000000003s)]
*  But it felt like Taylor in that every part of the show was really I [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3050.1400000000003s)]
*  Don't want to use the word choreographed, but it was thoughtful. Yeah [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3056.94s)]
*  Which is important. Yeah, incredibly important. I always loved that but it sounds like an expensive show though [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3061.42s)]
*  Oh, it must be so [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3067.1400000000003s)]
*  Fucking expensive to produce that show for him like I mean we know we look into these things like [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3070.0200000000004s)]
*  Mind bogglingly I got to look up the price for the tickets because [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3078.0200000000004s)]
*  Just to break even on a show like that. Yeah, and keep in mind you're limiting the amount of people now [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3082.98s)]
*  You have no floor that can be thousands of people on the floor. That's something like it [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3088.5600000000004s)]
*  Is he making money some floor little we lost shifty to the mosh pit [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3093.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah shifty hit the mosh pit that was shifty's first concert [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3097.46s)]
*  Dude his favorite artists of all time that Travis guy [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3100.18s)]
*  That's lit he go he gets to meet him but also goes to his first concert and like he hit the mosh [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3104.42s)]
*  It was great. The craziest thing production wise is [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3109.98s)]
*  He was in Boston in that arena ten days before and the normal logic is you would [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3112.94s)]
*  Leave up all that stuff and do two nights in a row so they had to set up and break that down the reason [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3118.6000000000004s)]
*  That's crazy is is because you're paying the expense for a show a lot of times is [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3123.54s)]
*  The staff to set it up and then take it down [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3128.8s)]
*  So if you can stay in a city for multiple days, yeah, you only have to pay to set it up once [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3131.32s)]
*  Set it up and take it down twice. This is like super expensive moving all the gear whatever but uh, but yeah [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3136.6400000000003s)]
*  It was just cool. It's cool to see people [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3142.2200000000003s)]
*  That are at the highest level [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3145.08s)]
*  With that attention to detail. Yeah, like I like that [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3147.6s)]
*  I like seeing successful people not being like oops, I guess oh here. Yeah, I like seeing someone go [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3151.48s)]
*  yeah, we thought about every part of this these people pay a lot of money to come down to the show and [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3158.84s)]
*  They deserve to have this experience. Yeah. Yeah, it was awesome [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3163.56s)]
*  And it looks like tickets aren't actually crazy if you get them right right when they sell obviously resales probably wild [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3167.52s)]
*  You can probably get like nosebleeds it says here for like 25 35 [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3172.08s)]
*  And then at the floor it's looks and it looks like three like 250 [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3176.56s)]
*  Just let everyone know [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3182.1600000000003s)]
*  Most seats in an arena are great. So get your seat like yes. Yeah, that's a bargain, but now I was go it was dope [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3184.36s)]
*  I mean just what a fucking cool weekend and then the picture y'all took was fine [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3190.32s)]
*  Again I don't know Travis that much so I don't know that he always looks down in the pic [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3196.84s)]
*  So he does this thing where like he always looks down. Yeah, right. So we took the pic and I'm like [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3201.24s)]
*  You asked to say hi to me [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3207.48s)]
*  What what is this so I didn't know that that's his thing [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3210.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's fine that's his thing. So you know, you know cool you're a little cigarette [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3215.0s)]
*  No, no, we're fine. But it was one of those things where I didn't get it at first. I was like, oh no, this crazy [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3219.52s)]
*  Disrespect me like that like that's wild [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3225.56s)]
*  What would you do your pose if you knew he was gonna do that pose I would have acted more excited I [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3227.56s)]
*  Lean in that's funny to him being the cool one and me being like the nerd [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  I wish I kind of knew what it was but that then I somebody sent me some pictures where he was doing it with [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3238.6s)]
*  Different people and I go. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is his thing, but there was a moment. I was like this motherfucker got me [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3242.6s)]

*  she's up [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3263.6s)]
*  It was far the whole weekend amazing that sounds crazy. Yo, shout out Boston man. Thank y'all man [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3267.0s)]
*  That was that was far. All right guys with a break for a second [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3271.68s)]
*  You already know a time it is you see the lighting you see that cool breeze, but you know, it's not gonna be cool [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3274.52s)]
*  Because the blue chewy [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3282.88s)]
*  Is already been consumed [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3284.88s)]
*  Okay, it's coursing through your blood the hardest dick you've ever had in your life is about to pop up erects unbutton your pants [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3287.08s)]
*  And deliver a night of sweet passionate sex [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3293.56s)]

*  Has got your back. It's got her back sticky bent over curved up. No turtle shell [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3301.44s)]
*  Not with the chew though should probably want to do that because you're going so deep [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3307.8s)]
*  It's gonna rearrange a couple things do some interior decorating if you want the blue chew same active ingredient [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3311.64s)]
*  That's inside by Agra Cialis, but you don't want to mess with those nonsense things [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3318.16s)]
*  You want the chewy you want the blue chew blue chew calm? Okay use a promo code flagrant [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3322.72s)]

*  Let's get back to this. All right guys, we'll take a break for a second [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3335.72s)]
*  Look there are certain bad habits that we can't name because of you know, YouTube rules [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3338.52s)]
*  But they can cause cancer and faezy and a bunch of other bad shit [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3343.32s)]
*  And again, we can't say what this bad habit is, but it will kill you if you don't quit [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3347.2400000000002s)]
*  But instead of quitting cold turkey, why not just replace that harmful product with one that's actually good for you [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3352.44s)]
*  That's why you need fume. Okay fume is an innovative award-winning flavored air [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=3358.4s)]

*  Drake always post on stake like that's I think maybe people like to see it [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5365.74s)]
*  But it seems like an exorbitant amount of money [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5369.62s)]
*  but maybe it personalizes the gambling experience a little bit more you actually feel like you're gambling not like the [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5371.66s)]
*  The computer generated numbers. I think people don't trust that shit as much. They're like, yeah, you know what I mean? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5376.7s)]

*  20 bucks an hour it's cheaper than a fucking [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5385.9s)]
*  But to build that to develop it to have the trust yada. Yada. What think about this is cheaper than a casino [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5388.5s)]
*  You could put this in you could put 50 of these in some hotel [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5393.0599999999995s)]

*  And so I'm saying more problem more you don't pay the overhead nothing. The only issue is you can't tip him [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5403.599999999999s)]
*  He probably gets way less tips and these guys make their money from tips [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5409.78s)]
*  You can tip him but like if oh, yeah [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBEf3miK7YY&t=5414.9s)]
