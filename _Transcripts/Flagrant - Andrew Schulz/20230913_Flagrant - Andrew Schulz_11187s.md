*  Your character would never try to be funny [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=3993.94s)]
*  Your character would be dead serious [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=3996.66s)]
*  And the thing that I think you guys do so well in the sketches is the characters aren't trying to be funny [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=3998.18s)]
*  This situation is funny. Yeah with the characters being serious and [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4003.22s)]

*  If you could tell it's a joke and a character just hanging out would never say a joke [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4023.1s)]
*  Yeah, and if they did say joke we would all acknowledge that it was a joke. Yeah. Yeah [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4027.5s)]

*  macro view of career and world and all these things like he's looking at things like [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4814.18s)]
*  storylines, yeah, you know and he's like [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4819.34s)]
*  Without sharing anything he handles these types of situations better than most yeah, and [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4821.54s)]
*  If you believe that there's a greater [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4827.9s)]
*  There's a greater ending for you in the future then you can handle these little hiccups [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4830.9s)]
*  But I mean imagine him selling the redemption story. Yeah, cuz that's one of the things he's great at is [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4836.0199999999995s)]
*  building up the story of the fight and [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4841.46s)]

*  Everything I know I'm watching any interview. He's like, oh, thanks to my dad who fucking abused me it paid off [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4871.42s)]
*  Yeah, he's like a big works. Yeah, he's like child abuse works far and he's laughing while he's saying like he knows it's a joke [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4879.58s)]
*  Okay, he got a belt. He was like, I know Dana's pissed like fuck this fucking retarded [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4886.3s)]
*  Maybe I'll get a sponsorship but fuck Nike [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4893.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting to say that was like Nate though with those [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4900.58s)]
*  You ever see that clip when they were all giving them like the rocks under armor shoes [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4903.98s)]
*  Oh, he's like and every UFC fighter was like these are awesome. These are the new coolest way. He's like, yeah, I [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4907.3s)]
*  He's like fuck these shoes [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4914.26s)]
*  I don't sound like that. I was like, okay, you're right never again [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4923.62s)]
*  The one of the cool thing about him fighting fighting Jake is or when he fought Jake was that like you could tell Jake [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4927.9800000000005s)]
*  Either respects him or [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4935.4400000000005s)]
*  Unless he fears him but knows he's like scary crew that Nate [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4938.08s)]
*  Right now with so like Jake didn't really go crazy in the promotion in terms of like the insults to him or his family [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4941.360000000001s)]
*  I think that and then Nate wasn't really saying anything too crazy about them [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4946.68s)]
*  There seemed to be a dislike based on respect. So in the interviews going up you saw Nate like [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4950.52s)]
*  How like you got to see way more of who he was as a dude? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4955.0s)]
*  like he was on Bradley Martin's podcast and he was just kind of like [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=4958.52s)]

*  Cuz I'm curious on JFK and the assassination of Oliver Stone on JFK [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7756.66s)]
*  And what does he sound if can he made the movie that basically like really popularized the conspiracy theory? Yeah up into the right [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7761.88s)]
*  Yeah [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7769.42s)]
*  It was like a much more underground thing before this the guy up there what Lee Harvey Oswald didn't shoot him from the window [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7778.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, whoever else had it was also some other people taking shots. So he he did fire [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7785.38s)]
*  But other people also fired the shots hit him in the front [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7792.3s)]
*  according to a [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7796.58s)]
*  Documentary I watched but Lee shot right while falling asleep. Yes [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7798.28s)]
*  Right. So at that point, what does it matter? I? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7802.44s)]
*  Think the CIA killed JFK [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7805.84s)]
*  I don't think Lee Harvey Oswald was a Patsy. Of course. He's a Patsy. He was a CIA boy himself [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7810.16s)]
*  They got a hold of him early [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7816.0s)]
*  Do you subscribe that Manson was a CIA boy? I mean he was MK ultra. That's I think I think that's [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7818.4s)]
*  True [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7826.44s)]
*  It was a LSD program CIA was doing they were just like hey [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7828.44s)]
*  Let's see what happens if we can can we use LSD to have mind control over people and ended up resulting in a lot [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7831.679999999999s)]
*  Of people losing their fucking minds and being like violent psychos. Yeah, yeah, like Charles Manson whitey bulger was one did they stay fucking? [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7837.12s)]
*  He was a kid. I'll contrast. Yeah [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7844.32s)]
*  Wow now I knew he was an informant, but I didn't know that he was MK ultra. He was MK ultra [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7847.08s)]
*  Is [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7852.04s)]
*  That I mean that's a pretty convenient [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7854.0s)]
*  Line of thinking if you're like a mob guy that wants to believe that whitey's real. Oh, he wouldn't have snitched but the [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7856.4400000000005s)]
*  I think they all say I think every single mob guy snitches. Yes, and that yeah, they're all little rats [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7863.320000000001s)]
*  I mean if you get into it if you get into the job of committing crimes for money, I [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7868.280000000001s)]
*  Don't think you have the most moral backbone and then when you look at 25 years. Yeah, you go [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7873.280000000001s)]
*  But that was that started like the 70s right the mafia started in the u.s. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7878.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the 20s and then for 50 years they couldn't crack it because nobody would roll over [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7882.24s)]
*  No, I mean they would just pay whoever was in charge. It was a lot easier back then I think [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7886.04s)]
*  What do you mean they they would pay the mob you could buy people off? [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7889.92s)]
*  I think a lot easier in the 20s. Ah, you mean the government. Yeah, the prosecutor. Yeah [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7893.36s)]
*  Okay, so then who ends up killing? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7897.96s)]
*  JFK you heard Woody Harrelson's dad. Oh that one's crazy. Yeah, what is that? This is crazy [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7900.36s)]
*  I really know the full details, but like now there's pictures of Woody Harrelson and RFK like hanging out together [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7906.32s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It's like oh dad killed his uncle [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7911.5199999999995s)]
*  Because Woody Harrelson's dad worked for the CIA. Yeah, and they're saying that it was [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7915.76s)]
*  Woody Harrelson's dad that kills JFK or is involved in the plot or actually well, it's a thing [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7920.4s)]
*  There's so many people out there. We only heard one shot [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7926.4s)]
*  No, that's not true [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7929.88s)]
*  There's literally interviews with people being like I heard a shot from right there [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7931.719999999999s)]
*  Like a little yeah, and that's the thing they have one they don't know there was there were multiple shots [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7935.28s)]
*  Oh, I hear everyone saying I heard a shot Jeff some people from here [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7941.48s)]
*  You got shot multiple times get one in the neck one the head one went through him and bounced around the car [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7946.04s)]
*  Okay, the guy was [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7953.24s)]
*  Pinpoint accuracy one of them missed the car entirely and hit the curb [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7955.4s)]
*  But wouldn't that be like a good like it would sound like machine guns one shot coming [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7958.66s)]
*  Here [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7964.5199999999995s)]
*  One guy be not accurate whether they like how let's get our worst marksman to kill the president [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7966.5199999999995s)]
*  I think if three guys are shooting one missed. Oh [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7970.5199999999995s)]
*  You have whoa. I didn't know three guys. Yes. There's multiple shooters [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7974.5599999999995s)]
*  So you have two assassins that are CIA and then you have one Patsy and the Patsy you blame it on and then these guys [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7978.5599999999995s)]
*  Get a job done. The only reason you have those two guys there is if you don't believe in this guy's ability to shoot him [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7985.08s)]
*  Because if you believe that he could shoot him [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7991.18s)]
*  Why do you even have that I guess my thing is like if you've convinced Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot and he is gonna shoot [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7993.3s)]
*  And he pulls the trigger and a bullet comes out [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=7999.54s)]
*  Whether or not he's the one that kills them or somebody else. I think you just want to make sure you get it done [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8003.900000000001s)]
*  Because if you miss this is your one shot, so then second and third shot hit yeah, okay [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8010.740000000001s)]
*  Okay, we've all heard but then yeah, have we heard gunshots before [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8015.5s)]
*  Here where it comes from so that there's one coming from here one coming from there one coming from here [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8020.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's like but you would know this [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8025.42s)]
*  Well said that now you're saying this and that's actually what happened [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8027.62s)]
*  And so there are people and there are literally interviews of people that were like we heard gunshots from right there [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8030.66s)]
*  It's called the magic bullet, right? That's well the magic bullets [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8034.820000000001s)]
*  No magic bullets how the war and Commission explained how it went through [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8037.14s)]
*  Yeah, his back and bounced around and hit hit [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8040.42s)]
*  Senator Connelly or governor they basically they have to they have to make two bullets out of one bullet [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8045.14s)]
*  Yeah, and the bullet was totally unscathed. It was a totally [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8049.94s)]
*  Yeah, so there's people somehow bounce off bones and didn't yeah, there's people saying that they've heard gunshots from different places [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8053.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8059.58s)]
*  Look some fugazes went down to the grassy knoll to try to find the shooter immediately [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8061.099999999999s)]
*  Running towards it Wow. Yeah, so apparently Woody Harrelson's dad was a contract killer. I found I figured it out [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8067.299999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he was a contract killer [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8074.0199999999995s)]
*  He got convicted of killing a John H wood was a judge and then basically while they were trying to arrest him [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8075.82s)]
*  He told him he was like in a standoff [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8080.66s)]
*  He was like, yo [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8082.66s)]
*  I killed Kennedy and they kind of fueled the rumor search and then they could like kind of backed off of it [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8083.22s)]
*  He only got convicted of killing the one dude. Let's see mafia. Yeah, apparently he was like an organized organized crime figure [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8088.0199999999995s)]
*  Harrelson is what like Norwegian or something? Yeah, but they probably could have outsourced just the contract killing [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8094.0599999999995s)]
*  You're not in the mob you can find one or not a tiny but we can outsource kill [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8098.5s)]

*  American interests for the next hundred years and [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8210.98s)]
*  If the CIA is the decision-maker there, then they're gonna make sure that nothing gets in their way [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8213.539999999999s)]
*  Now is the CIA working for these like billion dollar corporations as well? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8218.3s)]
*  Possibly, okay, so then if they're willing to go to those levels of taking out a president then are they just top dog? [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8223.859999999999s)]

*  So who's the top if the top depends on what need what decision needs to be made for example? [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8291.66s)]

*  But there's the great argument right where it's like [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8323.72s)]
*  Anybody the CIA hated you could make the argument might be doing the quote-unquote right thing [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8326.679999999998s)]
*  Hmm so if the CIA takes out JFK. It's like well. What was he trying to do? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8334.0s)]

*  So you have a food company in Costa Rica? Yeah, and you need to make and all of a country goes hey [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8362.720000000001s)]
*  We're not gonna you guys don't own these resources [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8369.84s)]
*  This is our country's resource then all of a sudden the CIA sends the boys down there and lets you know that it's not your [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8372.2s)]
*  Resources and they go hey, there's an election coming up. Here's the new guy [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8377.4s)]
*  He's gonna win and if your guy wins we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna support some rebels that are gonna execute [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8381.56s)]
*  Yeah, they buy up the printing press buy up the news push some story. Which is you know how we're doing this yeah [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8387.199999999999s)]
*  If we were in Costa Rica, we wouldn't be doing this we'd be out fucking picking bananas for the Dulles brush [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8393.84s)]
*  So the same thing probably happens with oil same thing happens with precious minerals. You know I mean like yeah, obviously we went to [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8399.4s)]

*  The whole time damn it so that's the question who's in charge maybe but then so here's the real question is do you want someone to [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8419.039999999999s)]
*  Be in charge. I don't even think anyone's in charge. I think it's just a do you want somebody to plot the course of America? [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8425.56s)]
*  I think it's easy to like we do this thing where we sit here, and we like we bitch and complain and [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8430.84s)]
*  And we go these are the bad guys and they're awful and there's these conspiracies and this at the other [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8437.4s)]
*  But at the same time we like love most of the shit that we get to indulge in because of all that [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8442.08s)]
*  So not directly because of it, but partially because I sure exactly so it's like there's part of me if I'm them [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8447.72s)]
*  I go okay. Y'all want to run it. Do you want to run it every four years? [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8453.68s)]
*  Yeah, like do you want every four years a new guy to come in and make all the new decisions? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8456.76s)]
*  Or do you want someone else to plot the course of America? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8463.32s)]
*  I don't know [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8468.119999999999s)]
*  For the record none of us think we're right [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8472.48s)]
*  That's a problem. Yes, can you have a couple drinks and everybody they come we didn't say we're right [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8475.52s)]

*  Obviously you want picked him. He was one of my prize picks to go more than I remember literally going on to prize picks and going [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8754.36s)]
*  This is the was it 225 yards? [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8759.640000000001s)]
*  Yes, I was like this is the easiest easiest money [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8761.640000000001s)]
*  This is the easiest more that we've ever put down and I was like guaranteed more [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8764.560000000001s)]
*  We picked a couple other ones. Obviously you just go more look more or less prize pick shout to prize picks [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8769.08s)]
*  So what shout to price picks because it's it's wild fun. Yeah, that's what it is [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8774.16s)]
*  They've really gamified it. It makes you feel like an expert. Yes, like when I'm going through the more or lesses [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8780.16s)]
*  I'm just like yeah, this is light work kind of a true false test [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8785.12s)]
*  I almost want to hit prize picks and just be like I'm about to bankrupt you so let's just make sure [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8788.16s)]
*  Everything that we talk about in terms of like your guys investment in us comes in and maybe we should even hold that [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8795.24s)]
*  What does it call when you hold something with like a lawyer escrow? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8801.52s)]
*  We should hold an escrow because I'm gonna bankrupt you outside of and they gave you a free one [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8804.36s)]
*  They said that press got more or less than half a yard and you you knew that that was like so if he gets one yard [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8808.640000000001s)]
*  It's you got it every that's a free square for everybody and you only got to do two. Yes [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8813.04s)]
*  Okay, so we did okay this last week. We did okay this last week. Okay, so prize picks this week [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8817.560000000001s)]
*  What are we looking at? Okay, so I'm still to Akash locks. Oh fuck [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8822.72s)]
*  Pressure but I feel confident in this pressure to attack of I lo he's a quarterback of the Dolphins. He had 400 plus yards last week [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8829.16s)]
*  So what are we going for this week? They're saying two sixty four point five against New England [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8836.439999999999s)]
*  How is New England's defense? I mean, he's built Belichick [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8840.439999999999s)]
*  So they're always gonna be pretty good [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8843.08s)]
*  But I just think to has got so much speed at receiver with Tyree kill who's gonna be a monster this year [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8844.4s)]
*  He thinks he's gonna get two thousand yards. I think he has a real shot at it [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8849.16s)]
*  And then if you double him they got this other guy Jalen waddle speed freak. They just got so much speed [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8852.460000000001s)]
*  I think you got to pick to it and then this one I [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8857.84s)]
*  Maybe I'm going more on the two or more on to it for sure. And then on this one. I might just be [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8862.300000000001s)]
*  Dallas Cowboys Homer again, but they're saying that [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8868.62s)]
*  We have a date says either thing two hundred and thirty six point five yards for deck is what they're predicting more or less against against the Jets [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8872.54s)]
*  I know the Jets defense is good, but I think they lowered the stat line because that barely had to play last week [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8878.980000000001s)]
*  He only had like a hundred seventy yards last week because he didn't have to because it was [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8885.42s)]
*  26 nothing so you really think that is gonna put it up against so I think that can get more than 236 [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8888.82s)]
*  I'm personally and I know that there's no reason that I should do this [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8894.140000000001s)]
*  Because Akash locks are always Akash locks. I'm going for the less now. They got a good defense [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8898.78s)]
*  This is a little riskier and I think that they're feeling themselves. They're like our guy went down [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8904.7s)]
*  Our guy went down after the fourth play the game [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8910.02s)]
*  Yeah, the guy who is gonna be the golden boy of our franchise even though he's in the twilight of his career [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8913.22s)]
*  He is our confidence. He is our I mean he is our tesseract, right? [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8918.619999999999s)]
*  This is where we're getting everything from this why we believe in ourselves and then he went down and they still won [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8923.22s)]
*  They still want it is there a good fucking squad [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8927.64s)]
*  So I'm gonna go less on deck even though there's no reason I should because obviously the Cali show the fuck up [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8930.22s)]
*  I'm gonna go less you go more. I'll go more. Those are the two Akash. That's the Akash lock for you [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8935.099999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna go obviously, you know Akash knows way more about football. I'm gonna go less on that one [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8939.3s)]
*  This is the beauty of prize picks. You don't got to be an expert bro [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8944.8s)]
*  That's the thing. This thing is this thing is dangerously fun. What else we got? Can we add a little something else? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8948.539999999999s)]
*  So you want to go three? I mean there's part of me because you increase the odds crazy if you go three it come because [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8953.22s)]
*  How's Philadelphia's defense Philadelphia's defense is good and deep [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8958.5s)]
*  So you wouldn't you wouldn't think that Kirk Cousins could go more than 262 [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8962.140000000001s)]
*  I he I don't have very much faith in Kirk Cousins as a quarterback, especially against good team. Hold on Trevor Lawrence [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8966.98s)]
*  They have him two fifty nine point five against against Kansas City [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8973.0s)]
*  Now Kansas City is coming off a loss, but I feel like I think that's very doable. I think it's very do really throw it on there [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8978.380000000001s)]
*  All right, fine. So Trevor Lawrence is going for over two fifty nine point five. It's not crazy the more days NFL [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=8984.58s)]

*  To some easy place. They're always gonna do that, but at least we get an idea of what I think you should make some sacrifice [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10781.640000000001s)]
*  To be part of the country [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10787.640000000001s)]

*  Not necessarily that some form of national service it more here no more here [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10824.56s)]
*  But if it meant to be that then sure best time to drink it no but for real if it meant to be that [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10829.359999999999s)]
*  Then for real true. I wish I did something stay with it. I wish I did something just one week in a month [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10833.48s)]
*  one week in a month [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10839.76s)]
*  Do something [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10841.88s)]
*  Shane said he was a name. I should have been a fucking special force again [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10843.24s)]

*  No good luck getting anybody that's also it's anti-american [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10859.4s)]
*  American it's anti-american to want to be part of America no to force people yeah [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10864.8s)]
*  It takes away [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10868.88s)]
*  There's something in the draft anti-american people have argued that yeah, do you believe is anti-american or is it not if we need it? [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10871.359999999999s)]
*  So it's like World War two like it's an existential you could argue that I need it for social harmony forever [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10878.759999999998s)]
*  Only one year to feel invested in yeah, that's less of an imminent threat [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10883.64s)]
*  This is the imminent danger or are we so polarized now that we can't I think you just care so little about the Jews that [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10886.759999999998s)]
*  World War two didn't seem like that big deal [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10891.519999999999s)]
*  I [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10898.88s)]

*  Absolutely, it's like it doesn't bring that many cultures together. Yes, it does you get to New York you better assimilate [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10925.84s)]
*  Nah, but you better act you better be far left, bro. Yeah, but if you don't like Alabama [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10930.4s)]
*  Alabama I don't know here. It's there. I wonder if they're more accepting of I don't know [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10936.359999999999s)]
*  New York you're kind of forced to have to New York you got to go if you say I'm a Republican they go you get out [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10941.4s)]

*  exactly [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10950.439999999999s)]
*  New Yorkers say if you're not Republican then you're a weirdo and then New Yorkers also be like yo [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10951.68s)]
*  No homo, bro, like chill like why you trying to make all these gay references? That's wild. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10955.4s)]
*  Yeah, transplants are super liberal [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10961.119999999999s)]
*  Actual New Yorkers are like yo, what's going on over here? Yeah. Yeah, I [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10964.039999999999s)]
*  Would say New York's probably not the most accepting place in America [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10969.16s)]
*  Really I [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10972.12s)]
*  Think we're the most [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10974.92s)]
*  Honestly, I'm a native New Yorker. I feel we're the most accepted [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10977.880000000001s)]
*  Can I can I chime in on your behalf because I think when you come here every single person here votes the same way [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10981.1s)]
*  That's wrong. We had a we had a Republican mayor when? [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10986.560000000001s)]
*  all of them [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10990.52s)]
*  Well, Eric Adams is when Bloomberg is a registered Republican to the entire life. Julianni Republican [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10992.52s)]
*  Republic of Bosnia is a gay. Yeah [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=10999.74s)]
*  I'm just saying that was back before [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11003.66s)]
*  politics were as polarized I [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11006.539999999999s)]
*  Think I don't think it's fair [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11008.74s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to say any area that the entire populace votes the exact same way [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11010.74s)]
*  be it [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11016.539999999999s)]
*  Alabama or New York isn't the most accepting but on a city level isn't that most places most places are [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11017.9s)]
*  Pretty one way or the other like yeah, there's four states where your vote really matters [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11024.46s)]
*  Alright go outside and say there's only two genders [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11029.58s)]
*  See if somebody wasn't screaming your face [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11033.02s)]
*  You part of a different New York bro, didn't we vote in the dude that lied about his old fucking resume [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11037.02s)]
*  Yeah, he lied about some gay shit. Yeah, that guy was awesome [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11042.78s)]
*  But I got ruled but he was a Republican and we voted him in because his resume was nice. Yeah [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11045.58s)]
*  Yeah, you can't forget that guy regardless. I'm just I think that's a reasonable thing to say [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11050.98s)]
*  Accepting New Yorkers, it's not the most I think you're also confusing transplants with right like native New Yorkers [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11056.679999999998s)]
*  So I do the same thing I moved here [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11062.24s)]
*  Yelling and you're like what the fuck I thought I was a person y'all making me feel [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11064.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm an asshole [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11068.22s)]
*  I think a lot of those people move here because they feel like they can be free to have their like [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11069.4s)]
*  Very progressive opinions and I think a lot of New Yorkers that are like born and raised here just like yo [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11073.48s)]
*  What's up with these blue hair chicks? I agree with that. Yes. Yes. I agree. Yes the guy on the garbage [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11078.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11085.0s)]
*  So the worst and I think that makes up a lot of New York [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11087.08s)]
*  I think they're the loudest ones. Yeah, that is true in New York and they're the ones that like post the opinions on social media [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11090.2s)]
*  But like actual New Yorkers, I don't think they're tripping a lot of us a lot of natives got pushed up [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KASW3lX5w&t=11095.36s)]
