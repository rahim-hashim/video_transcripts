# Trump's Tariff Gamble EXPLAINED w/ Chamath
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E)
*  Hello everybody. The stock market is nose diving faster than Conor McGregor at a Colombian cookout. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=0.0s)]
*  People are concerned, anxious, terrified. So we've asked someone to come on the podcast to calm your [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  nerves, put you at ease. No, not her. We've asked our richest friend Chamath Pineapple Porta Potty [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=12.08s)]
*  Platypus, the former owner of the Warriors, one of the earliest hires at Facebook, a legit billionaire [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=17.28s)]
*  and the host of the biggest business podcast in the world, All In. If you would take some time away [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=22.16s)]
*  from surfing on the top of a train to explain why the stock market looks like Saxon Ratliff the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=26.88s)]
*  morning after a sibling stroke off, we're going to find out the real end game for Trump's tariffs, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=31.52s)]
*  what happens if they don't work, and why we might already be in a recession. Indulge in this bonus [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=35.84s)]
*  flagrant episode. Why don't we just start at the tariffs in general? What exactly is Trump doing? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=41.68s)]
*  What is best case scenario? What is worst case scenario? And then what are your personal thoughts? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=48.72s)]
*  Let's look at your Air Force ones or your dunks that you guys are wearing there, or your Converse. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=56.0s)]
*  Those things are made or Jordans, those things are made outside of the United States, even though [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=63.52s)]
*  the company that makes them is an American company. And what happens is they're made over there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=71.12s)]
*  And then they're shipped to the United States and then they're sold to you guys somehow. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=78.64s)]
*  And you would think that that's all fine and good because you're like, well, hold on, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=86.0s)]
*  this is an American company, I'm supporting an American company. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=91.28s)]
*  And it turns out that the details are a little bit more complicated than that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  So starting in about the year 2000, what happened was there was this, everybody thought that the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=100.08s)]
*  right thing to do was to push every country in the world to this form of capitalism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=108.08s)]
*  And they looked at countries like China and they were like, how do we make China [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=117.36s)]
*  more capitalist? And you would say, well, why would we do that? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=121.92s)]
*  And the governing logic at the time was, if they're more capitalist, they'll also become [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=125.68s)]
*  more democratic. If they are more democratic, they are more predictable the way that we normally [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=132.4s)]
*  think about countries. So let's not repeat a cold war. Let's not repeat maybe some other political [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=138.08s)]
*  regime in the forties or fifties or sixties. And so what happened was we let China into the WTO, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=146.32s)]
*  the World Trade Organization. And what that allowed corporations to do is basically an enormous form [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=151.68s)]
*  of arbitrage. So let's say that those Jordans were made in the United States and you were paying a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=162.0s)]
*  worker 25 bucks an hour to work on a line to make that shoe. And then you would send it to footlocker [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=168.24s)]
*  and sell it. I'm just being very simple, just to kind of explain this example. But now, instead of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=175.6s)]
*  having to pay sort of any typical form of taxes, Nike, after the year 2000, was able to ask the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=182.4s)]
*  question, where else could I make this Jordan? And the Chinese raised their hand and they said, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=190.24s)]
*  Hey guys, we have these really great factories, we have extremely good workers, and we can do it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=197.52s)]
*  for much cheaper than 25 bucks an hour. And so what does Nike do? They send the job over there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=203.36s)]
*  Take that one narrow example and apply it across every industry you can imagine, from shoes, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=211.44s)]
*  to iPhones and everything in between. And what has essentially happened over the last 25 years is we [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=218.32s)]
*  have hollowed out an enormous part of the middle class economy in the United States. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  And we've explained it away by saying, Hey, we don't want to do that kind of work. Instead, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=234.0s)]
*  we're going to, you know, like all of us, like we'll do a podcast or, you know, somebody will be a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=239.2s)]
*  consultant, like you'll just go up the stack, right? They'll say up the stack. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=244.56s)]
*  And so over the last 25 years, that's been happening. And all of these other countries [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=250.56s)]
*  have benefited from America's largesse. And the reason you can say that is we are the big buyer [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=255.36s)]
*  of record for everything, right? We have the largest economy. The way our economy works is we [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=264.32s)]
*  are all buying shit, all kinds of shit, all manner of it, from that water bottle to that shirt to that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=270.64s)]
*  hat. 80% of our economy is just consumers buying stuff. And the rest of the world makes an enormous [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=276.32s)]
*  amount of money by feeding that beast. And so you would say, Okay, well, what's wrong with that? Now [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=283.68s)]
*  the cost of Jordans is much cheaper, the cost of that, you know, those jeans are cheaper, life is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=290.56s)]
*  good. Except it's not, it's more complicated than that, which is then when we turn around, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=295.68s)]
*  and we try to sell our product into those same countries, instead of it being allowed to just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=303.12s)]
*  come in, so that, you know, I'll make an example, let's say that hat is made in the United States, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  and we want to sell it to somebody in Cambodia or Vietnam. The same way that those dunks enter [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=318.64s)]
*  the United States with no tax, we would expect that that hat can go into Cambodia and Vietnam [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=324.16s)]
*  with no tax. But that turns out to not be the case. And why is that? Are they trying to protect [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=329.68s)]
*  local businesses? It's a great question. I think that for every country, the answer to that question [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=333.92s)]
*  is different. But it typically starts with how can we generate revenue for ourselves? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=340.0s)]
*  I don't think they have a competitive, you know, New York Yankees hat manufacturer in Vietnam, for [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=347.68s)]
*  the record. But it's just a policy that allows them to make money off of the United States in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=355.6s)]
*  two ways, right? They make money by making stuff there, sending it here where we all buy it, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  and the dollars go back. And then they make money in a different way, which is whenever we try to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=366.72s)]
*  sell our products there, they can tax it on the way in. And then why would we tolerate that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=371.2s)]
*  I think what the logic was, was back to what I said earlier, there was this thought that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=376.96s)]
*  America is doing really well. We can allow a little bit of this leakage because of the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=386.8s)]
*  quote unquote greater good, the greater good being, let's get these countries out of poverty. Let's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=394.08s)]
*  get them, you know, embracing capitalism, democracy. I think it's a combination of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=398.8s)]
*  benevolence as well as there was some strategic rationale. You know, like the some sometimes you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=405.92s)]
*  could make a claim that allowing these countries to profit was like a national security thing, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=412.72s)]
*  right? Like, hey, they'll be there for us if, you know, we ever get into a spat with x, y, z other [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=418.8s)]
*  countries. So there was a whole host of complex reasons. But the net result, Andrew, was that this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  dynamic was happening, but it had been happening for a long time. Question, question. And then we [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=430.08s)]
*  can move on. Is it possible that the countries were trying to protect the things that were made [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=437.28s)]
*  there? In other words, like we have all these cool products that are made in America, obviously, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=441.2s)]
*  it's very sexy in a bunch of these third world countries. They're like, listen, we can't let the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  mom and pop businesses or even the corporations that are thriving in this country be out competed, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=448.64s)]
*  if you will, by the American businesses? Possibly. But then, you know, I would say, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=455.28s)]
*  well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. It can't be a one way ratchet on [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  globalism and free trade, where it's like, you know, you're going to take our stuff, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=467.44s)]
*  but we're not going to take yours. I agree with you. I'm just trying to find the justification [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  for the country. Like, I think, I think, I think, to be honest with you, it's a, it's probably driven [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=476.64s)]
*  a lot by revenue. It's like it was tolerated. Nobody pushed back. Nobody pushed back. Right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=481.84s)]
*  Because again, we would say, yes, it's happening. But and some politician would insert this statement [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  about democracy and capitalism and long term national security or what have you as the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=494.0s)]
*  justification. And then Americans, we don't want, we don't want any tariffs, because it affects [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=499.12s)]
*  our businesses. Right. Like Apple doesn't want any tariffs. I'm sure Uniclo doesn't want any [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=508.4s)]
*  tariffs. I'm sure Levi's doesn't want anything because it affects the amount of money that they [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=514.9599999999999s)]
*  can make. So they're essentially nobody, of course, nobody wants any, nobody would want any [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=518.8s)]
*  tariff in an ideal scenario. But now you have to think about like, what is the government of the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=523.04s)]
*  United States is responsibility. I'm just saying like, why the private sector hasn't pushed back [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=528.4s)]
*  from the reason they haven't pushed back and because they would be the ones losing money. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=533.12s)]
*  Well, I think they are pretty violently pushing back. Everybody that hasn't been exempted, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  I think, is pushing back. So and what they're trying to point out is like, hey, listen, like [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  these tariffs have a real price. Now, I meant I meant why they wouldn't push back about the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=550.24s)]
*  unfairness that had happened over the last 25 years. Like, for example, Apple that wasn't [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=555.7600000000001s)]
*  tariffed at all wasn't going, hey, you know what, China's tariffing us, maybe we should tariff them [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  because it would hurt their bottom line. Well, let's be honest, how many Chinese can afford to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=565.76s)]
*  buy a $3,000 iPhone versus how many Americans can buy a $3,000 iPhone. And the reality is [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=570.0s)]
*  that when you factor in, again, this goes back to what I said before, do not underestimate the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=575.12s)]
*  absolute gargantuan largesse and kick acidness of America. Like it's easy to slag it. But this is a [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=582.24s)]
*  first among equals country on every dimension, culturally, artistically, economically, militarily. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=592.72s)]
*  And we take it for granted. And so when you think about Apple, for their bottom line and their P&L, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=600.96s)]
*  would they love to have maybe, you know, an easier time to sell phones all around the world? Sure. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=609.52s)]
*  But it's much more valuable for Apple to make the phones in China for as little as possible and get [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=615.12s)]
*  them to the United States, where they can sell 50 million of them every year. That's right. You sell [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=621.12s)]
*  50 million phones here, you're not worried about selling 10,000 in El Salvador. Yeah. Or, you know, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=626.48s)]
*  like, you know, if you look at like the amount of like iPhones sold in India, that's 1.2 billion [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=630.96s)]
*  people. You would think to yourself, hey, hold on a second, let's just go and focus. India can't [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=635.84s)]
*  drive the consumption to support a $3 trillion economy like the United States can. So this is [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=642.48s)]
*  the key insight. America is the country, American consumers, the five of us, okay, the 330 million [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=647.92s)]
*  of us. We create more downstream value for all these companies in all of these countries, in all [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=656.56s)]
*  of these stock markets. And then the question is, well, what is fair if you actually look at it that [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=664.24s)]
*  way? And I think what Trump has wanted to do for a very long time is just make things more fair. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=671.52s)]
*  And his perspective is, why don't we just make things more proportional? Now he uses the word, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=682.64s)]
*  or not he, but I think like the chart and all of this stuff, they use the word like reciprocal, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=690.0s)]
*  you know, like you tax me, X, I tax you, Y. I think that that's that was actually the wrong word. I [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=694.16s)]
*  think the right word is more proportional, meaning if you're a country that's taxing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=698.56s)]
*  our ability to do business in your country, we should have a proportional tax that tries to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=705.1199999999999s)]
*  level that to a reasonable point. But the reality is that it's much more important for them. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=711.68s)]
*  And I think that what Trump has started is a process of getting like the 80 or 90 most, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=721.1199999999999s)]
*  you know, vibrant trading countries to realize this, that they've had the best of it for 25 years. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=728.24s)]
*  I think he's also trying to realize recognize that there's a small sliver of people that have [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=740.88s)]
*  over benefited. Meaning like, you know, like these globalist corporations, the people that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=747.12s)]
*  own those corporations, at the sake of a lot of Americans, let's just say, you know, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=753.84s)]
*  five or 10 million Americans absolutely crushed it over the last 25 years with globalism and trade. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=759.28s)]
*  But that still leaves 325 million Americans that haven't. And so you have to right this ship. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=766.64s)]
*  That's one. The second thing, though, is you saw this in COVID. America is totally unprepared [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=776.0s)]
*  to fend for herself if push came to shove. We can't make things here anymore. Right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=785.68s)]
*  We have we you know, we have kids that can make tick tocks, but we don't have scientists that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  can make drugs. That's not sustainable. That's not a secure country. Like if you look at our [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=797.84s)]
*  military programs, right, we spend, I think, $700 billion a year. Those five American companies [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=806.96s)]
*  that make all of our weapons systems are American. Great. One step removed. Most of the companies [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=818.08s)]
*  that they work with to make those weapons systems are also American. And you say, great. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=826.4s)]
*  But one step removed. If you look at where all of the key inputs to all of this stuff that we use [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=833.28s)]
*  to keep ourselves safe and to protect our allies and to, you know, to have influence in the world, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=838.48s)]
*  all of that stuff can be shut off by China in a snap of a finger. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  Can you give an example of what that would be? You're talking about like the screws that go into [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=850.48s)]
*  the plane. Like how much more much more important than that. It's like, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=855.84s)]
*  let's just say that I'll use an example that that that I think we could all relate to. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=862.88s)]
*  We need to electrify as much of the United States as possible. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, meaning we need more electricity, not less. We barely have enough electricity for all of the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=876.32s)]
*  needs that we have. Okay, fair. There's brownouts. There's all these. There's all these. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=883.52s)]
*  It's all nuts. Okay, we need more energy. Okay. One of the things that we need more energy for is [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=889.04s)]
*  electric cars. I'll just use that as an example. Electric cars need an electric motor. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=895.84s)]
*  So far, so good. All of that stuff can be American. But inside the electric motor, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=901.92s)]
*  the way that the electric motor works is that there's a magnet that spins really quickly. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=906.72s)]
*  That magnet is made from something called rare earths. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=911.6s)]
*  There is nobody right now that can really secure a meaningful pipeline to those rare earths, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=916.08s)]
*  except through the Chinese. They're incredibly good at it. They're incredibly sophisticated. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=924.32s)]
*  And they have a top down way of organizing that market. That's an example. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=932.0s)]
*  Let's say that you need batteries, not like the simple Duracell that you buy at Target, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=939.0400000000001s)]
*  but like the big batteries that can store energy when it's made or whatever. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=943.5200000000001s)]
*  There are two companies that know how to do this at scale. They're both Chinese. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  And you can go on and on down the line in every critical market where America needs to be able [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  to take care of itself under all weather conditions. We have become very fragile. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=961.12s)]
*  Tariffs have this dual pronged impact. Prong number one is it starts to realign the world order. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=972.8s)]
*  But prong number two is that it allows us to start taking back control of a lot of these markets [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=982.96s)]
*  so that we do the hard work so that we can rely on ourselves. Otherwise, if something bad were to [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=991.12s)]
*  happen, there's a lot of really bad outcomes here where we cannot fend for ourselves. We can't make [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=998.16s)]
*  the vaccines we need. We can't make the technological equipment we need. We can't make the computers we [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1005.28s)]
*  need. We can't make the chips we need. Sorry, follow up question. The tariffs, I actually [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1013.52s)]
*  agree in theory with everything you're saying and have for a while. How do you feel about the system? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1018.4s)]
*  I'm seeing a lot of things about the calculations they came up with and it seems haphazardly [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1023.68s)]
*  thrown together. Can you explain that? Is that true? What do you think? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1029.12s)]
*  I think the way they did it was very clever. They made one mistake which is in language, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1033.28s)]
*  which is they put the word reciprocal and they should have put the word proportional. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1037.12s)]
*  You know, Akash, if I sell you a dollar and you send to me five dollars, the right way to think about [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1042.08s)]
*  what a tax would be would be, well, there's a four dollar differential, so let's make it proportional [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1052.72s)]
*  to how much I'm giving you and you're giving me. The formulas that they used were proportional [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1059.12s)]
*  formulas. It got caught up in all of this English language semantic nonsense. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1066.24s)]
*  Got it. Okay. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1071.92s)]
*  And then people who wanted to run with that tried to exploit the word and try to create confusion. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1074.0s)]
*  But the simple way to think about it is if I'm here and you're here, the whole goal of the tariff [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1082.0s)]
*  is to just do this. Make it proportional. Make these things proportional. That's the math. That [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1089.28s)]
*  math does work. They were saying in some of the... I saw an article that was quite critical and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1094.96s)]
*  it said it was haphazardly done because they were just matching trade deficits. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1100.96s)]
*  No. So here's another thing that... Let's debunk that as well. So... [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1104.88s)]
*  Yeah, please. So can you explain the trade deficit between two countries and how that works? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1108.48s)]
*  So how does a trade deficit work? So for example, like let's just say between the United States and [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1112.48s)]
*  China, they send us $10 of goods. We send them $1 of goods. That's a $9 deficit. Right? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1116.64s)]
*  We're bringing in more than we send out. Okay? So there's an entire economy of Chinese companies [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1124.8s)]
*  that get supported with the $10 of money that we give them. There's only $1 that benefits [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1132.24s)]
*  American companies. That's a trade imbalance. It creates a deficit. And all... Now, by the way, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1138.32s)]
*  it's not that a deficit is bad. Okay? Sometimes you want a deficit. Sometimes you want a surplus. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1145.6s)]
*  But you want to be able to pick and choose where you want to be at any time with any country. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1152.8s)]
*  Right? That would make sense. That's like, hey, man, I'm just... I'm not going to just take this [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1158.56s)]
*  at face value. I'm going to evaluate the conditions and I'm just going to tweak the knobs every now [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1162.56s)]
*  and then to make sure that I know where I'm at. Some countries may be so strategically important. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1169.84s)]
*  We're like, you know what? We're going to run deficits with you. That's cool. You guys build [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1176.16s)]
*  up some stuff. But on the back end, let's talk about some other deals we could do. Give us some [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1180.0s)]
*  critical things that we need. And we're cool running a deficit. Some other countries where maybe we [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1184.8s)]
*  don't get as much from them as we have historically or should, we should run a surplus. But let me just [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1190.8s)]
*  make sure that you guys also know one other thing about these last couple days. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1197.44s)]
*  A lot of people started to try to make a meme out of like, oh, look, this country's only got [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1202.32s)]
*  penguins. You know, that country is in the middle of nowhere. Here's a really important thing to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1206.48s)]
*  understand what has happened over the last 25 years. Every single time anybody has tried to fix [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1213.52s)]
*  these imbalances, what companies were able to do was just to go to a different country that wasn't [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1223.52s)]
*  affected and basically mule their way into America. If you levy these taxes on every single country, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1235.44s)]
*  they won't be able to do that. You close all the loopholes. Got it. So it's like an imbalance when [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1243.04s)]
*  you throw it on Lesotho, but you're really doing as a preemptive measure so that all the manufacturing [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  doesn't go from Cambodia to Lesotho overnight. And the thing with that is like, it's not like [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1253.44s)]
*  they're going to build the factory there. Right. They may just use it as a way station. You know, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1259.28s)]
*  the plane lands, hop, skip and a jump. Now you get a form that goes, boom, made in Lesotho, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1265.04s)]
*  boom, to the United States. So you make it in China, send it to Lesotho. We buy it from Lesotho. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1269.76s)]
*  There's no tariff on Lesotho. The specific thing that really happened that exposed this was again [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1274.48s)]
*  in COVID, you know, and just a little bit before Mexico became like an enormous way to kind of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1282.3999999999999s)]
*  work around a bunch of the Chinese tariffs. You would just basically send the goods to Mexico. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1290.32s)]
*  They would do what's called self attestation, which is basically saying, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1296.6399999999999s)]
*  yeah, it's made in Mexico. And now you get under a totally different regime. You avoid a lot of [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1301.2s)]
*  taxes and other stuff. And so, you know, I think what they were trying to do is basically say, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1308.08s)]
*  all right, folks, hit the pause button. We saw what you did the last time. We're just going to [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1312.6399999999999s)]
*  make sure that there are no loopholes. And look, like, so maybe the question is like, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1317.04s)]
*  what do you do from here? You know, like in Godfather, there was like that scene where [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1324.1599999999999s)]
*  like all the families come together and they're basically trying to like negotiate like, all right, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1332.72s)]
*  what's the, what's the detente and like Michael Corleone runs that. It's not a perfect analogy, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1336.8s)]
*  but I think what's going to happen now is there is an opportunity for all of these world leaders [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1343.68s)]
*  to have a very different conversation. And here's what I mean. We pay a ton of money [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1349.2s)]
*  into all of these like globalist organizations. WHO, World Health Organization, supposed to do some [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1357.52s)]
*  healthcare stuff. NATO, supposed to do a bunch of defense stuff. The United Nations, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1366.72s)]
*  supposed to do a bunch of governance stuff. IMF, supposed to do a bunch of money stuff. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1374.48s)]
*  World Bank, supposed to do a bunch of other money stuff. Right? We pay into these organizations [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1379.84s)]
*  massively. And it's not clear that any of this shit works. Okay, just to be honest. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1385.68s)]
*  And so there is an opportunity to sort of say, Hey guys, if we were just starting this club [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1397.2s)]
*  in 2025, what are the rules of membership? What would the, what would the expectations be? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1405.04s)]
*  What are you going to do? What am I going to do? What are you going to pay? What am I going to pay? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1413.04s)]
*  But right now, again, it's kind of like you go to dinner, Andrew pays. We're like, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1418.8s)]
*  we'll Venmo you tomorrow. Money doesn't show up. And you're just like, guys, this is like, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1425.6s)]
*  after years of this, you're just like, okay, come on, stop the madness here. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1430.96s)]
*  Is there a concern that in a time of trade hostility, China could come in and basically, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1434.56s)]
*  you know, broker more friendly trade deals with other countries and America could lose [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1441.52s)]
*  its global position? Yeah, I think that that is a risk. The question is, what does that deal look [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1445.4399999999998s)]
*  like? Look, my personal opinion is that I think that it's basically this. There are two main [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1452.72s)]
*  superpowers for the next hundred years, us and China. And I think we on margin on the margins [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1466.0s)]
*  have a more compelling deal to do than China does. And the reason is because we have these [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1475.52s)]
*  330 million Americans who are absolute kingmakers. And I think you have to take advantage of that. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1484.96s)]
*  The Chinese are incredibly strong. They're incredibly bright, but they have headwinds [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1495.6s)]
*  to man, you know, like nothing's perfect, like their population is cratering. That population [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1500.72s)]
*  is going to have in the next like 50 years. So China has to figure out some very complicated [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1507.28s)]
*  things for itself. So it's not like China has like some perfect deal that it can offer the world. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1514.24s)]
*  So there's there's give and takes on both sides. But yeah, they're going to try to do it. And [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1520.48s)]
*  they're going to try to do the best job of getting countries convinced. That's why we have to have [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1525.84s)]
*  some amount of bargaining chips, right? Like if you show up to Europe and you're like, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1531.9199999999998s)]
*  let's do a deal. Is a better deal done when Europe feels like you're serious? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1538.56s)]
*  Or if Europe feels like, well, I mean, you know, they've they've paid our way for the last 50 years. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1547.12s)]
*  Yeah, why would they stop? Yeah. So you got it. You have to like, you know, it's almost like like, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1553.76s)]
*  it's tough, but like you have to like, you have to have some reasonable expectations here that, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1559.52s)]
*  you know, that there's like a decorum. So I think that [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1566.24s)]
*  it'll but it comes down to the quality of these deals to your point, like what is the actual deal. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1573.76s)]
*  And I think the thing to remember is there is no country in the world that can buy stuff the way [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1579.36s)]
*  Americans buy shit. I mean, like, truly, it's like a lot of people can make shit. But you need you [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1585.76s)]
*  need an economy that is going to consume and you can't really grow that overnight. You can't. It's [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1593.28s)]
*  true. We have had, you know, a lot of practice in making money as a country, but also spending [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1598.24s)]
*  money. Yeah. And I don't think we should forget that. To piggyback on Mark's though, the way that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1604.96s)]
*  Trump is implementing these tariffs across the board, are there any guardrails that can prevent [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1611.2800000000002s)]
*  China from just going to everybody and be like, okay, they're applying at least a 10% tariff on [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  you. I'll either give you 5% or free trade. Okay, so really good question. So now you go to the [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1623.8400000000001s)]
*  tactics of it. Whoever it is, let's say it's us or it's China. And let's just say that we're [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1630.4s)]
*  going to pitch Europe on why you should go one way or the other. At the end of the day, when you're [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1637.0400000000002s)]
*  doing deals like this, you have to show a PNL, right? A profit and loss statement. Meaning, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  once all the fancy words are done and all the cameras go out of the room, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1652.0s)]
*  this gets to the brass tacks of a spreadsheet that says here's how much money you will make [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1656.8s)]
*  by working with us. And this is where there is a very clever deal, I think, for Trump to get done, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1663.52s)]
*  which is the following, which is to essentially say that there is sort of like this new global [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1672.24s)]
*  trading alliance. And, you know, according to a set of rules, in joining the club, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1678.4s)]
*  pay your proportional share, right? Pay your membership dues on time. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1686.56s)]
*  And there's a way that you can have access to this incredible market that would be [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1693.2s)]
*  so when you do that PNL, right, and you get a bunch of Western countries that align with that, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1698.0s)]
*  because you have to remember on an economic basis, look, eight billion people in the world [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1705.2s)]
*  were all equal. But economically, there is a hierarchy. Okay. And so it's America at the top, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1709.52s)]
*  then you know, you have the G8 countries, G7 countries, the rest of them, right. And then [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1716.8000000000002s)]
*  it goes down there and you can just rank this. And so the more of these countries you have in [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1722.0800000000002s)]
*  this new alliance, the companies that work through that lens will just make more money. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1728.32s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Like a trading NATO, so to speak. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1737.28s)]
*  Michael Hichsor I think that's a really good way of thinking [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1740.08s)]
*  about it. It's like exactly like, like in the modern, like, look, like in the for the next [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1741.84s)]
*  hundred years, do we really think the solution for protection is like a tank? You know what I mean? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1748.3999999999999s)]
*  Like a tank is like 70 years old. It's like 100. It's like, it just doesn't make sense. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1756.32s)]
*  The real protection is what you said, which is like economic cooperation, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  the aligned interests, aligned interests, and a bunch of drones. You know, I mean, like, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1766.3999999999999s)]
*  that's it. Soterios Johnson [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1773.52s)]
*  Do you feel like the tariffs actually address the root problem of bringing jobs like specifically [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1774.24s)]
*  middle class jobs have been lost to China, like shoe manufacturing back to the United States? Or [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1778.24s)]
*  is it mostly a political tool to get these rates to be more, you know, have more parity? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1782.16s)]
*  Michael Hichsor I think step one is the the rates. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1788.4s)]
*  And step two is what kind of jobs come back to the United States, I think is still unclear. But [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1792.0800000000002s)]
*  there are a lot of really good trade type jobs. I'll give you an example. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1798.48s)]
*  And in the United States, from 2017 to like 2022, a quarter of all of the people that work for power [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1805.0400000000002s)]
*  utilities is eligible to retire. Take their full pension. What do you think that happened? What [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1818.3200000000002s)]
*  do you think has happened since 2022? I'll tell you. Our infrastructure is crumbling, power lines, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  transformers. There's more wildfires because of utilities. The average experience of these folks [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1833.92s)]
*  have gone down. The amount of brownouts and outages have gone up. Those are jobs that can pay 80, 90, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1840.4s)]
*  100, 120, $130,000 a year. These are good jobs. There's just no people to do them. I'll give you [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1848.72s)]
*  a different example. We are trying to build nuclear submarines. We need 100,000 people to build those [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1856.0800000000002s)]
*  submarines. All kinds of stuff, electronics to metalwork to whatever. They can barely find a [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1863.04s)]
*  thousand. And there's all kinds of stuff. So your question is the right one, which is what kind of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1871.12s)]
*  jobs will come back? Or what kind of industries could we have that we don't have enough of? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1879.2s)]
*  And this is where, look, now you're starting to talk about a lot of complicated social policy [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1886.0s)]
*  as well, because part of why we don't have people is a bunch of us were tricked to go to university [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1890.32s)]
*  and get 200K in debt to take a degree in art history, which was stupid. Instead, you should [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1896.56s)]
*  have just gone to a trade school and made 150K a year and had a good life. But then in order to [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1902.48s)]
*  have a good life, you needed to live in a reasonable city that had not stupid housing policy. So there's [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1906.8s)]
*  a cascade of all of these issues. So it's probably a little too early to say that exact job that's [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1913.44s)]
*  in China is going to be here. But we don't need that job. But there are different kinds of jobs, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1920.88s)]
*  necessarily. I'm slow. If it had a tab tariffs help the examples you gave of infrastructure, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1925.2s)]
*  it would seem infrastructure is irrespective of a tariff. We could build up power lines. We could [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  build up any of these things without a tariff on England. All of the things that we need. Again, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1935.2s)]
*  it goes back to sort of what I said before, like all of the things that we need. We don't have a [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1940.56s)]
*  really great way of making them here. And so it just, we're like in this very circular argument [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1946.3999999999999s)]
*  all the time. So we need to have some internal resiliency. You know what I mean? Like we need [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1953.2s)]
*  to have like a rainy day fund. We just need to have some money in the savings account in case, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, shit hits the fan. We don't have that right now. So I'll give you an example, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1964.3999999999999s)]
*  like in energy, okay? Like very, very, very reductively, the world is going to be decided. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1968.88s)]
*  Like meaning like if this was like the NBA regular season, okay, we're entering the playoffs. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1978.0800000000002s)]
*  Who wins the championship? It's very simple. The person that controls AI [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1984.64s)]
*  and the person that has the best military. That's it. And when you say it that way, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1988.8000000000002s)]
*  you're like, okay, there's all these things that we need to do for AI as an example. Okay. You're [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=1997.04s)]
*  like, well, we need like infinite power for AI. Okay. Well, how do you get power? Oh, well, let's [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2001.36s)]
*  just do Nat gas. Okay, great. And immediately you realize, oh, hold on Nat gas turbines. It takes a [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2006.1599999999999s)]
*  turbine, right? To make energy out of Nat gas is so backlogged because none of it comes from America. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2014.08s)]
*  We cannot turn it on until 2030. Okay. So now Akash, tell me how, how are we supposed to win [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2022.4s)]
*  the NBA finals against China? Yeah. When they have everything. Yeah. They can make everything. Yeah. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2029.3600000000001s)]
*  And we can't yet. Yeah. So we're kind of, are we going to, are we just going to wait five years [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2037.28s)]
*  and hope it solves itself? Are we forcing our own hand to develop these industries? I think so. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2042.4s)]
*  Got it. Okay. So part of it, part of is forcing our own hand to develop these industries, making it [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2048.64s)]
*  too expensive to consume from other places and also making it too expensive for them to sell to us. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2054.0s)]
*  So we create an incentive to, to create these industries here. Also real quick, I just want to [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2059.2799999999997s)]
*  go back to that trade deficit thing. If we are the world's consumer, doesn't it make sense that we do [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2066.24s)]
*  run a trade deficit with most countries? And isn't that a healthy thing? If that's the position we [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  want to be in, if that's where we feel like the leverage exists. I think that there's a very [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2075.04s)]
*  philosophical answer to this. I think the technocratic answer is you want to have the ability [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2079.2s)]
*  to change it as you see fit because it changes the incentives for countries to cooperate with [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2085.2799999999997s)]
*  America. Okay. So just so I can understand that America, I'm not sure exactly where we were [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2090.88s)]
*  before world war II, but we have enough manufacturing that on a dime, the entire country [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2098.0s)]
*  can turn into a military operation. Ford is rolling out tanks. Like we have the ability [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2103.52s)]
*  to engineer and manufacture everything that we need to win a war. Right now we are too dependent [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2108.64s)]
*  on outside factors. So we actually can't flip that switch if we need to. So it's like putting [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2114.8s)]
*  ourselves in a position where we can flip the switch and that gives us way more bargaining power [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2119.92s)]
*  and leverage in the real world because we are not a hundred percent reliant on these other countries. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2123.84s)]
*  Exactly right. And there's just a lot of hard work. I'll give you, you want to hear a crazy story? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2129.44s)]
*  Yes. In 2020, I had this kid pinging me constantly on Twitter and he had worked for Elon building up [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2134.4s)]
*  the battery supply chain for Tesla and he had left Tesla to go to business school. He was at [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2144.0s)]
*  Stanford. The kid was just like constantly just like at replying me, whatever. So I thought I'm [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2150.16s)]
*  like, all right, just come to my office and we'll talk. And he's like, I think we need to build [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2156.0s)]
*  a domestic battery business in the United States to compete with the two Chinese national champions. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2160.88s)]
*  And I was like, okay. So I started to learn about this problem and it's like shockingly crazy. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2168.64s)]
*  So we start the company, him and myself, a professor from Stanford and this other guy [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2177.28s)]
*  who worked at Toyota. So, you know, four reasonable people. Okay. And we start this business in 2020. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2182.08s)]
*  We're like, we're going to make domestic batteries. We get a deal with General Motors. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2191.52s)]
*  They invest, they go on the board, things are going well. And then we get to this place where, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  and this was under the Biden administration, we needed the approval of the DOE and the signaling [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2200.56s)]
*  from the DOE, the department of energy that yeah, this American company is not bullshit. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2208.72s)]
*  We take a year, we go through, we stand in line, we play it exactly down the middle. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  We file this like 600 page report, the consultants that they told us to pay, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2221.8399999999997s)]
*  we paid, we did everything, got rejected. I was like, okay, this makes no sense. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2226.0s)]
*  You tell us like, we need to like have this resilience, but instead this is not resilient [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2232.08s)]
*  at all. Fine. We keep moving forward and we decide last year to reapply, do the same thing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2236.0s)]
*  We get through the end of all of this and we get picked, 125 companies apply, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2245.76s)]
*  gets down to like 25 finalists. These guys give an incredible, they do an incredible job, by the way, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2254.72s)]
*  the DOE employees, like of the diligence and stuff like this was like, I've never seen anything like [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2260.24s)]
*  this. We go through proctology exam, it's like you wouldn't believe. We get it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2264.56s)]
*  Federal government gives us a hundred million dollars, Michigan gives us 50 [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2270.56s)]
*  to build this factory in the United States. And we're like, wow, we declared victory. We're like, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2274.4s)]
*  that was the right thing to do. That was worth all the hard work. Now other people can pay [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2279.68s)]
*  attention, we can raise money. This is a hard problem to solve. It takes billions of dollars. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2284.64s)]
*  It's like money is an infinite, so I need other people to be beside me. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2289.6s)]
*  And I needed the government. And then, when Elon goes into Doge, I find like, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2293.6000000000004s)]
*  Stacey Abrams spins out of Biden and in 30 days got a $2 billion grant [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2300.32s)]
*  to buy appliances for like 25,000 people in Georgia. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2310.48s)]
*  So we have a lot of cell phones here as well to blame for this. That is an insane story. How did [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2315.04s)]
*  she get 20 times more than we did? We have a 50 person team that makes batteries to compete with [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2320.32s)]
*  the Chinese at the same quality. We got a hundred million dollars by a two year process. She started [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2324.88s)]
*  an application on June 1, June 30, you got 2 billion. How does that work in America? Is that [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2331.92s)]
*  right? That is not right. How does that work? Well, it's not working anymore. Thank God to Doge, but [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2337.1200000000003s)]
*  that's not right. Is that some cronyism? Yeah. I mean, I think it's kind of like there's a come [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2343.68s)]
*  along, pay along, play along element that again, Trump is shutting down. Look, you have to give the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2351.92s)]
*  guy credit. He's been consistent. And the one thing that he's doing is he is closing these loopholes. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2360.48s)]
*  That takes a lot of balls. Okay. Question. I've heard, I've seen a lot on Twitter about, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2367.2s)]
*  everybody has their own opinion on like what he's actually trying to do. Right? Some people are like, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2374.56s)]
*  they're taking the market on purpose to get the debt yield down. Can you speak on this theory? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2379.9199999999996s)]
*  I think Bessent has been in a few interviews talking about it. Yeah. Okay. So what are they [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2386.7999999999997s)]
*  talking about? So here's the thing. America owes people a lot of money. Okay. We owe, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2392.88s)]
*  my gosh, I want to say maybe $35 trillion to other people. Now it's important to understand [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2402.32s)]
*  who are those other people and why did that happen? Yeah. So let's just say the five of us [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2410.7200000000003s)]
*  are running America. We all go off into our own separate rooms and we come back with a plan. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2417.36s)]
*  And Andrew, you're like, I want to spend a billion dollars on defense. And then [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2425.76s)]
*  Marcus, I want to spend a billion dollars on healthcare. And I say, I want to spend [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2430.08s)]
*  $2 billion on social security or whatever. And we tally it all up. Right. And we're like, okay, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2434.08s)]
*  to run America is going to cost $10 billion. How are we going to get that money? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2441.6s)]
*  And, you know, ever since like 1913, it's a go fund me. The answer is we're going to go to all [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2448.32s)]
*  the individuals in the United States to pay for it. By the way, just so you guys know, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2457.6s)]
*  before 1913, okay, we had 120 odd years where all of that money, that $10 billion, whatever that [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2462.96s)]
*  number was at the time, it was all generated via tariffs. Okay. It was outside folks paying into [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2470.08s)]
*  to have the right to be in the United States. Then we would take that money and we would pay [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2477.92s)]
*  for healthcare. We would pay for social security. We would pay for military. We did all that stuff. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2481.68s)]
*  Okay. So anyways, fine. So here we are, but you add up all the amount of taxes we raise and it [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2485.04s)]
*  only is 8 billion. So what do you do? You go and you borrow from somebody who's willing to lend you [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2491.12s)]
*  2 billion. Right. Just to clarify, like that borrowing doesn't necessarily mean a bank. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2497.2s)]
*  People can buy bonds. They can buy these treasury bonds. And so that similar thing. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2502.56s)]
*  So what happens is, okay, we're like, okay, shit, we need to come up with $2 billion. Where do we [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2507.92s)]
*  get it? So what happens is the United States Treasury is allowed by law to then go into the [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2511.52s)]
*  market. Okay. I'll explain what that means in a second and sell an IOU. Hey, this, this IOU is [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2520.72s)]
*  backed by the United States government, you know, full faith and fidelity of all of the assets that [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2529.3599999999997s)]
*  we own. Give me $2 billion. I'm going to take it. I'm going to fund this deficit and I'm going to [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2534.64s)]
*  spend my 10 billion this year. We've been doing that basically forever. Add it all up. Now we're [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2540.56s)]
*  at 30 some odd trillion dollars. Okay. Now what is the problem with that? Well, that is a colossal [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2547.04s)]
*  interest rate payment. Imagine that you take out now a credit card every year, max it out. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2553.92s)]
*  At some point, you know, you're going to have an enormous interest payment. Right. And that is [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2561.68s)]
*  dictated by the interest rate that is tied to the credit card that you have. It's the exact same [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2568.56s)]
*  thing for the United States government. We have 30 some odd trillion of debt and we have a really [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2575.84s)]
*  high APR. Yeah. The APR is what right now? Well, I think the blended is I want to say like [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2581.1200000000003s)]
*  five, 6%, let's say. So, you know, you're talking trillions of dollars in interest. Okay. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2589.6000000000004s)]
*  Which is a problem. So on top of that, these credit cards, assuming you have this credit card, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2595.04s)]
*  it expires and you got to go and apply for a new one. That's what America. So every year, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2603.6s)]
*  so right now in this year, America has $6 trillion of credit that is expiring that we don't have the [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2609.12s)]
*  money to pay for. So what do we need to do? We need to re-borrow that money. So issue more bonds. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2617.2s)]
*  So we have to, we have to sell bonds. So who are the buyers? The buyers are all these people around [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2622.56s)]
*  the world, central banks, pension plans. Also us. Yeah. So, you know, so here's so yes, but asterisks. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2628.48s)]
*  The thing that America is America, again, I go back to like, we are the star of the show. Okay. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2638.88s)]
*  Everybody is levered to the United States. Everybody. What does that mean? If you go to Japan, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2646.08s)]
*  Japan is way deeper in debt than we are. They have two times as much debt as we do relative to our [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2650.7999999999997s)]
*  GDP, relative to the amount of revenue that we make. And you would say, well, how's that possible? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2660.4s)]
*  When Japan finances their debt, the overwhelming majority of the people that are supporting Japan [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2666.4s)]
*  are the Japanese, Japanese companies, Japanese pension funds, Japanese individuals, your mom, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  your dad, you know, buying the Japanese bonds in America. It's not that it's about a third are [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2679.36s)]
*  Americans, but two thirds are everywhere. Okay. It's like the Saudi Aramco, it's shell, it's [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2684.88s)]
*  Novartis, it's the central bank of Lesotho, it's China. China owns almost a trillion dollars of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2692.56s)]
*  our debt. So, so the whole point is, if you can bring the cost of borrowing down, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2697.92s)]
*  we save ourselves a lot of money. We make the headache much smaller. Now, here's a huge problem [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2705.2s)]
*  that happened at the end of Biden. Real quick, real quick before you say that. So essentially, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2712.72s)]
*  if we can lower the APR, if we can lower the interest payment, then at the end of every year, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2717.52s)]
*  the money that we owe is much less. And then we can start chipping away at the principal and [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2727.68s)]
*  paying the interest. Another important thing to understand is the more people buy treasuries, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2731.76s)]
*  the lower the interest payment is on those treasuries. The less people that are buying [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2737.6800000000003s)]
*  treasuries, the higher it goes. Right. Exactly. This is like this. So if you can, some people say, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2742.48s)]
*  if you can scare people in the equities market, meaning that just the stocks, right. If you can [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2749.28s)]
*  scare them about stocks, if you can create uncertainty in the stock market, then they go [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2753.6000000000004s)]
*  buy treasuries. People go, I just need some security. I need something that's safe. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2757.2000000000003s)]
*  Security. I need something back with the full, what is it, support and fidelity of the US [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2760.8s)]
*  government. I need treasuries. They start dumping all that money into treasuries. You can reduce [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2764.2400000000002s)]
*  that yield, which is that interest payment. Now, before you move on, I just want to ask one question. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2768.48s)]
*  We initially, when this was mentioned, I guess, a couple of days ago by Trump, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2773.76s)]
*  you saw that yield go down almost like a point, right? Or at least it clicked. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2778.2400000000002s)]
*  It was enormous. We went from like 450. Like I was worried that it could go to five. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2782.88s)]
*  Instead, you know, when Trump said, guys, I'm doing this, I'm serious, it went from 450 to like 420. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2791.28s)]
*  And then it went under four. And then it went to like 390 something. And now it's right around back [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2797.44s)]
*  at four. Now somebody, when it started to go back up again, some people thought that a big holder [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2803.52s)]
*  of US treasuries, IE like a China or one of the other countries or companies they were talking [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2813.52s)]
*  about, purposely sold treasuries to flood the treasury market and then increase that [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2819.36s)]
*  yield, that interest payment again. Remember, the more that they sell, the more we got to pay out. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2827.04s)]
*  So it's a form of like eco terrorism. Is that bullshit or true? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2831.52s)]
*  I think it's bullshit. And I'll tell you why. There is no amount of money that you could spend [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2837.76s)]
*  that a country has in US treasuries to sustain that kind of price manipulation in a market that [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2844.64s)]
*  big. So it might be initial, but eventually it would start to, could you puke it out? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2852.16s)]
*  Like, meaning the thing is like, got it. These markets are extremely efficient. Like, you know, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2857.2s)]
*  in betting, like sports betting, I used to be a big sports better. Like it's all these guys are [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2862.48s)]
*  all sharps. Okay. Yeah. They know the line. Yeah. They know the edge. You're not getting an advantage [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2866.08s)]
*  over one day over five hours. Like that's got it. So it would, it would be China literally unloading [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2873.76s)]
*  the trillion dollars in bonds that they have. They wouldn't do that. And they wouldn't do it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2880.32s)]
*  Of course, there's probably some sort of like competitive advantage they have owning that [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2884.32s)]
*  type of debt. Guys, we're gonna take a break for a second. I want to tell you one thing that [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2887.28s)]
*  tariffs do not affect freedom of speech. Okay. Now speaking can make you quite tired. I know that [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2891.28s)]
*  Akash knows that Mark knows that Alex knows that you can even get exhausted speaking your [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2898.2400000000002s)]

*  not just coffee, they also have energy drinks for all of you guys who don't like coffee for [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2909.2000000000003s)]
*  whatever reason. Frankly, I think you're retarded, but if you want energy drinks, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2913.68s)]
*  black rifle has got your back. Look at this zero sugar project mango, not to be confused with [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2918.48s)]
*  project a paperclip or whatever that thing where we took all those Nazi scientists. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2925.04s)]
*  Wait, don't talk about that. Don't bring that up. I don't want to get into it. We're not going to [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2929.04s)]
*  get into that kind of geopolitical mess. That's for a different podcast. We're focusing on America. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2932.4s)]
*  Okay. Obviously they've got the best premium coffee from around the world. These guys love beans. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2937.04s)]
*  Okay. Not the ones that are trying to sneak into the country. They love the beans. They keep us up [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2941.76s)]

*  energy drinks, get your energy up. Now let's get back to this show. The thing with Biden, just you [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2974.48s)]
*  guys know is, you know, if this is a misnomer that, you know, Trump is, you know, for the wealthy, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2978.6400000000003s)]
*  um, I don't think that that's true. Um, you know, Trump is much more about MAGA, which is like [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2986.2400000000002s)]
*  working class, middle class. He's not about the mag seven. That's what Besant said to, you know, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2993.36s)]
*  the stock market is a mag seven, magnificent seven problem, not a MAGA problem. What does he mean by [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=2998.08s)]
*  that? What he means is like 50% of Americans have zero equity exposures, zero. This is what we talked [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3002.88s)]
*  about when I did your, and this was huge. Yeah. And so, you know, and 44% of it owned like 12%. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3011.2s)]
*  So for the most part, the American individual investor is not necessarily super exposed to [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3020.48s)]
*  equities. And so the thing that Biden did though, is he had an incredibly aggressive program [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3028.48s)]
*  of keeping the stock market afloat. How do you do that? Okay. So like if you guys and I wanted to [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3037.84s)]
*  manipulate the stock market at the president of the United States, what could we do? Keep money [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  cheap. You would keep money cheap. You would, which means just for everybody, like making sure [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3049.52s)]
*  that the costs of taking out money, like interest rates are low. Yeah. You could, it's, we're high [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3055.52s)]
*  during Biden. They were high, but what Janet Yellen did was as the interest rates came due [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3061.04s)]
*  in that period, they massively just refinance the debt. And this is getting a little technical, but [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3069.04s)]
*  in very short periods of time. So when you, when you go and refinance yourself, right? Like if you [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3080.32s)]
*  go and refinance your home, you know, you could do a 10 year mortgage, you could do a 30 year mortgage. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3084.96s)]
*  She did a 30 day to one year mortgage. Okay. Now why would you do that? If it was cheaper, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3089.92s)]
*  right? And you basically had more flexibility to just keep money in the system. If you had, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3097.44s)]
*  you know, all these $2 billion loans going out to all of your friends who would just like spend in [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3102.88s)]
*  all kinds of crazy ways, everything looks like it's working. GDP looks like it's working. The [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3107.44s)]
*  stock market goes up because the earnings of these companies looks like it's working. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3113.0400000000004s)]
*  And what's incredible is that problem is now coming home to roots now. So Besant [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3117.12s)]
*  has to refinance $6 trillion in the next nine months. Okay. So this is like a, not a small [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3123.76s)]
*  number, right? So all this debt that basically Yellen and Biden just kind of put on the front end, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3131.44s)]
*  it's called the front end of the curve, like these one year maturities or whatever, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3137.52s)]
*  they got to figure out how to push it out 10 years, 12 years, as far as possible. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3141.12s)]
*  And so that's going to be a very complicated task. And so they benefit from the lower [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3146.1600000000003s)]
*  interest rate. And to your point, what tariffs did was it shocked the stock market. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3151.2000000000003s)]
*  And when that happened, it told the bond market, hey, man, there's a lot of volatility and [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3158.96s)]
*  uncertainty here. It's like, let's go to the sidelines for a little bit and just chill and [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3166.7200000000003s)]
*  observe what happens. When that happens, the interest rates go down. And that allows us, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3170.88s)]
*  Americans, all of us collectively, we will save hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3176.32s)]
*  because of what has happened in the last five days. So yeah, now maybe this will correct [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3181.6s)]
*  itself quickly, but if you can give me a steel man, I largely agree anecdotally with what you're [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3187.28s)]
*  saying. Again, we travel the country, we see, I see middle America and I see why they're angry. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3192.1600000000003s)]
*  I see like a lot of decay and you can tell me the stock market is high, but I'm like, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3196.56s)]
*  I don't think ordinary Americans feel this. So give me the steel man argument for why a stock [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3200.48s)]
*  market dip that doesn't scare me for regular Americans would be a big problem and whatever. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3205.36s)]
*  It is a big problem for people that are about to retire. It's a big problem for people that have a [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3211.44s)]
*  large percentage of their net worth there. It's also a big problem for the companies themselves, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  because if shareholders have a bunch of uncertainty, they may not give them more money. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3222.08s)]
*  These companies may not be able to invest as aggressively in the future. So it's not like [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3231.36s)]
*  it's not without pain. I want to be clear, like you're right, like there's no free lunch anymore. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3237.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like this is like big boy pants time. So we all put on our fucking big [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3241.68s)]
*  boy pants. And the reality is there is going to be these trade-offs. The question is, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3246.64s)]
*  how can you judge the trade-offs and make a very difficult set of decisions for the greater good? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3250.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that's gonna see where we're at. So yeah, there will be pain for some of these [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3259.92s)]
*  companies. Is it right? I'm not going to call that ball and strike. It's unfortunate. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3264.16s)]
*  And the reason we're here is not necessarily anybody's fault that's in this room. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3271.2799999999997s)]
*  But you gotta fix it. Sorry, go ahead. If the majority of Americans are living [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3280.24s)]
*  check to check, isn't this going to hurt them way more than it hurts everyone else? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3284.24s)]
*  Right. It's inflationary is what you'd say, right? So this is also another misnomer. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3288.64s)]
*  Okay. And I think this is important. What is inflation? Okay. Inflation means, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3294.08s)]
*  if you said inflation is, I'll pick a number, 3%, what does that mean? That means that if you and I [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3301.52s)]
*  bought those Jordans and they were a hundred bucks, next year, let's just use that for the [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3306.7200000000003s)]
*  purposes of this math, are 103, right? They go up by 3%. Actually, let's use 10% because I'm bad [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3311.44s)]
*  at 3% math here. So it's a hundred bucks. It goes 110. Okay. The next year it goes up by another 10%. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3321.12s)]
*  If inflation stays where it is, right? Now you add an $11, right? So now the shoes are 121. So in two [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3328.56s)]
*  years, the price has gone from 100 to 121 for those Jordans, right? That's inflation. The next [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3335.52s)]
*  year, it'll go up by another 10%. The next year, it'll go up by 10%. That's what inflation is. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3343.52s)]
*  Okay. This is a price shock and that's different. What do I mean? So if that Jordan has a 10% [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3347.36s)]
*  tariff on it, it goes from 100 to 110 one time. And if inflation is otherwise zero or close to zero, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3356.48s)]
*  it doesn't go up the next year by another 10 bucks and then another 10 bucks and another 10 bucks. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3368.96s)]
*  That's not how tariffs work. It is how inflation works. So I think it's important to just make sure [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3373.44s)]
*  our tariffs inflationary, they can be, but not necessarily. But if we import most of our products [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3382.0s)]
*  and we're applying tariffs to almost all the products we import, then that's going to be a [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3389.44s)]
*  huge price increase for pretty much all the goods that we buy. But it's not correlated to the cost [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3394.4s)]
*  of the actual goods sold. The reason inflation happens is, oh, the price of oil goes up, so it's [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3400.8s)]
*  more expensive to run the factory. So then the goods become, nothing changed to make your shoe. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  Nothing. It's just that when it landed in the port of LA, there used to be a piece of paper that you [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3412.4s)]
*  would stamp that said 0%. Now the thing is stamped and it says 10%. The actual cost of making this [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3418.7200000000003s)]
*  thing has not gone up. Yeah, but Nike's going to apply that to it. Yeah, past the cost of that. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3424.88s)]
*  He's not saying that the cost doesn't get passed on. So let's say it's a one time [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3430.24s)]
*  pass through. So let's say in the first year, nobody's saying it won't hurt, but why it's [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3435.68s)]
*  different than inflation. So in the first year, it would feel identical to inflation. In the second [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3441.3599999999997s)]
*  year, it would stay the same. Whereas in the second year with inflation, it would continue at that way. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3446.64s)]
*  And I guess what I'm saying is I'm just concerned about the people who are barely getting by and now [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3452.3999999999996s)]
*  1000% but here's what they said, which is, I think you want to see this happen. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3458.4s)]
*  What they said is there's going to be these price shocks. You're right. So year one is difficult. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3468.56s)]
*  But it could raise upwards of $750 billion a year. You're saying tariffs. Tariffs. What they said [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3477.2000000000003s)]
*  that they would do is they would then turn around and cut the federal income tax for anybody making [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3488.16s)]
*  $150,000 or less to zero. So what they're doing is using the tariffs to offset the price shock. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3496.96s)]
*  I didn't know that. Yeah, but this is the math and that hasn't been 100% established yet. But [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3505.52s)]
*  instead of instead of like putting the burden on the American consumer, we put the burden on [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3510.16s)]
*  the foreign country to pay that delta. And then effectively subsidize the consumer through income [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3516.64s)]
*  taxes. To be fair, the $750 billion, I assume is that's assuming everybody pays the tariff [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3521.2s)]
*  fully. Okay, so this is an important point. I would say right now it's a moving target, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3527.6s)]
*  meaning the sharps before Liberation Day, the smart money line was at like $250 billion. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3533.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, that's Wall Street. We'll put smart in quotes, but that was [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3539.76s)]
*  and part of why the stock market went berserk was they just got it totally wrong. And the back of [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3544.96s)]
*  that envelope math that I did, and that a couple of my friends did, and you know, I would say they're [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3552.96s)]
*  much smarter than I am. They got to $750. I got to $750 as well. Howard Lutnick, who's a commerce [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3560.0800000000004s)]
*  secretary, said like anywhere approaching 750, we have a line of sight to be able to cut [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3565.36s)]
*  income taxes to zero for anybody making 150 or less. Yeah, that'd be great. I mean, so we're in [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3571.36s)]
*  the magic zone here, guys. You know what I mean? So that's so there's a perfect example, like [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3576.88s)]
*  there's all this conversation about the midterms right now. Trump tanks the stock market, people [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3582.2400000000002s)]
*  get screwed over by some people calling inflation, but like the price shock. But if you announce at [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3586.4s)]
*  the end of the year, there's a $750 billion surplus because of taxes and we're eradicating [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3591.68s)]
*  income tax for people making under $150,000. Midterms are going red. I mean, bro, forget midterms. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3597.2s)]
*  They want Trump for the third term. Would there be a surplus if we're in so much debt? Isn't it [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3606.0s)]
*  just chipping away at the debt? It won't be. So I guess it's you use the debt. It's up to you, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3612.3199999999997s)]
*  how you use that $750 billion. And I assume in the first year to deal with the price shock, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3617.04s)]
*  I don't want to speak for each month, but it would be like, OK, this year that goes back to y'all. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3622.48s)]
*  We'll figure that out. Deal with the price shock. Now that everything is normalized and inflation [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3626.64s)]
*  is down, we'll start using that $750 billion toward the debt. But if you get rid of federal [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3631.04s)]
*  taxes, then you have to keep applying that money to offset. Yes. Yes, you would. 100%. But [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3636.0s)]
*  would it not sway voters? Oh, yeah, but that's not. Let's say you have to income tax. Right now, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3643.44s)]
*  we're talking about none. But let's say you have to. Hey, your income tax is going to be 50%. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3650.4s)]
*  What if your tax guy came to you and was like, yo, I got a way to get your income tax down to like [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3657.36s)]
*  50% of what you normally would pay. What he already does now. I get what you say. Is this a [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3662.96s)]
*  long term sustainable solution? Will this actually chip away at the debt long term? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3669.84s)]
*  Is what I was asking. Yeah. How can terrorists chip away at the debt? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3674.32s)]
*  I think, Al, the longer term, we need growth in America. How do you really chip away at this [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3678.1600000000003s)]
*  problem? You need to make more money. So I think saving money is good, but you need to make more [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3685.6000000000004s)]
*  money. How do you make more money in America? We need to have more people working and getting [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3690.72s)]
*  paid more money. And the way to do that is we need the kinds of industries that create enough value [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3699.9199999999996s)]
*  where you're willing to pay these folks more money. So like, like, you know, if you could go [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3711.2799999999997s)]
*  to a trade school and work for a utility and make, you know, 80, 90, 100, whatever, 110 K a year, and [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3717.76s)]
*  again, this goes back to the domestic policy that they have to get right and be able to buy a house [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3727.84s)]
*  and send your kid to a school where they're not going to get, you know, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3733.44s)]
*  fucked up in the head. They can get like a good, decent education. I think like that's how, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3736.8s)]
*  that's how you generate way more value in the United States, so that you can really start to [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3741.84s)]
*  chip away at it. Now, the other way that we will chip away at this is what Elon is doing with Doge, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3748.6400000000003s)]
*  because that is just rampant money going out the door. That is our American hard earned tax dollars [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3754.32s)]
*  that were taken from our pockets to siphon it into all kinds of places that you didn't know were [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3761.52s)]
*  going there. And what they're doing is just shining a light on it and saying, is this what [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3767.76s)]
*  we really want? Do we want 50 billion here and 10 billion there? And it all adds up, you know, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3772.96s)]
*  billion here, billion there turns out a little suspect if like he's chipping away at that stuff, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3779.28s)]
*  but then he's still getting government grants for a Tesla and SpaceX and all this stuff. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3783.36s)]
*  Bro, can I, can I just set the record? Okay. He's a friend of mine. So whatever I'm biased, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3787.1200000000003s)]
*  but let me just set the record straight. He got a $500 million support for Tesla during Obama. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3790.16s)]
*  He paid that back early. He paid it with interest and he paid it with an early prepayment penalty. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3802.3999999999996s)]
*  Okay. So I just want you to know that that is the facts. Yes, he got $500 million, but the other [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3813.3599999999997s)]
*  fact is this is the only person I've ever heard of in my life who's actually gotten some form of [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3819.2s)]
*  subsidy from the government, paid it back on time, actually ahead of schedule with interest, with a [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3825.6s)]
*  prepayment penalty. So whatever you think of the guy, I just want you guys to know that that is the [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3831.04s)]
*  actual facts of what happened in the early 2010s. And what did it do? It revolutionized our even [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3836.3999999999996s)]
*  awareness of all this stuff. Meaning if Elon had not created these electric cars and all of that [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3844.8s)]
*  technology, we would have, we would be even further behind today. Like you gotta, you gotta see, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3853.04s)]
*  you gotta appreciate what this guy does. You can go to gigafactory. I remember we have the opening [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3860.2400000000002s)]
*  party of the gigafactory and it's like outside of Reno somewhere or whatever. Like, I don't know, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3870.0800000000004s)]
*  it was in Nevada. We drove there. I have this video of me driving thing. It's like [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3874.4s)]
*  50, 60, 70 seconds, man, of just like, maybe even longer. The factory literally takes raw material, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3880.64s)]
*  like shit that comes in on like train conveyor belts and out pops a Model Y on the other end [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3888.2400000000002s)]
*  of it. You're like, how, how does somebody, so, and in a moment where the whole world was going [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3894.4s)]
*  berserk and Obama felt like, which, you know, I gave him a real solid for this. Obama did the [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3902.0s)]
*  right thing, but then Elon did way more to, you know, just to pay it back, to settle it with the [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3908.4s)]
*  government and the people to make it right. And then all this technology that he's created, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3915.04s)]
*  I cannot tell you guys, we would be so behind. I think that, I don't know if anybody here is [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3919.2s)]
*  critical of the technological advancements or the investment in, you know, the future of America's [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3925.84s)]
*  manufacturing and like engineering programs, like keeping us competitive a hundred percent. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3932.56s)]
*  I do think it's fine to like look at certain things and be critical of Elon in the way that [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3936.88s)]
*  maybe Doge could potentially benefit him or not. But I think it's okay to look at that. The, the, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3941.04s)]
*  the question here is though, if Doge finds a way to create savings, much to the chagrin of many [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3946.96s)]
*  people, but if it do find a way to make savings and those savings offset that money that the [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3952.32s)]
*  tariffs we're going to pay, then the savings can go to the debt. The savings can go to the debt. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3958.56s)]
*  Right. And then you have tariffs offsetting the, the income tax. And now you have no income tax [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3965.04s)]
*  and you are chipping away at debt. I mean, look, this is, this is a very optimistic, theoretically, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3971.1200000000003s)]
*  it's great. Yeah, it's great. Now, now is it, could you also give us the pessimistic view on all of [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3976.88s)]
*  this? Yeah. Yeah. So let's take the other side. Okay. So let's, let's start with this has the risk [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3983.6800000000003s)]
*  of creating economic malaise, meaning like what I said before, out to your question is we got to [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=3992.8s)]
*  grow, right? But growth requires investment, meaning I got to go and build a factory or I got [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4002.08s)]
*  to go and buy some chips or I got to go and want to make cars that requires money. Who gives me money? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4010.48s)]
*  Wall Street gives us money, right? Like, I mean, you know, we don't just pop out of Silicon Valley [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4017.6s)]
*  with people handing us billions of dollars. We have to go and, you know, frankly ask and beg [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4023.04s)]
*  Wall Street for the money. They could say no. Now, why could they say no? They could say [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4027.84s)]
*  too much uncertainty, I'm in bonds back to what we said before. And a lot of people say that they go [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4034.6400000000003s)]
*  super risk off in this moment. And, you know, then we have to like make these like really brutal [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4040.96s)]
*  decisions about how to fund these companies and, and keep going. I'll give you an example. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4050.0s)]
*  Um, you go to a hospital, not you guys, but if your wife or your sister, your mom went to hospital [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4058.0s)]
*  and she had breast cancer, there's a 30% chance that they don't get the cancer out the first time [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4064.0s)]
*  they do a surgery. The next time she goes back, there's a 30% chance. What that means is for every [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4069.52s)]
*  10 women that get breast cancer surgery, there's 14 surgeries, takes 11 days for them to take the [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4074.08s)]
*  pathology. Okay, this is in the United States of America. I was like, this had there has to be a [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4079.92s)]
*  better way. Okay, find a company, invest a ton of money. And I'm like, we're going to go solve [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4086.56s)]
*  this problem. We're going to make it impossible. We're going to use AI, you take the tumor out, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4091.68s)]
*  you put it in a special machine, the machine will tell you 100%. There is no more cancer, close her [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4095.7599999999998s)]
*  up. We do it. But you have to go to the FDA and get it approved. And the FDA doesn't necessarily say [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4100.88s)]
*  yes, go ahead, this is a great idea. You should do that. The FDA says, here's all the things and in [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4112.0s)]
*  fairness to them, they're doing the right thing. Here's all the things that you have to do before [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4116.8s)]
*  I'm even willing to consider that you'll turn you'll do this for us. I say, okay. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4121.12s)]
*  I went and tried to get money raised for that. Hey, guys, does anyone want to help me eradicate, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4128.4s)]
*  you know, make breast cancer surgery error free? I thought stupidly that that that idea just sells [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4133.52s)]
*  itself. You know what I got on the other end of that fucking crickets? Crickets. Oh, you know, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4141.52s)]
*  interest rates, this that inflation, this that whatever. Okay, fine. I pointed up the money and [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4149.4400000000005s)]
*  I did it myself. But that's not infinite. You know what I mean? Like if that next problem comes up, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4154.64s)]
*  I don't know that I can fund it. You know, eventually you run out of economic insecurity [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4162.56s)]
*  creates investment risk and then people get tied with their pockets and we need liquidity [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4167.44s)]
*  to keep the machine moving. You want people feeling like it's like it's like generally [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4172.32s)]
*  going in the right. So the pessimistic view is it creates uncertainty because [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4176.4s)]
*  it feels scary, the stock market's going down, there's volatility. And so let's go risk off. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4183.679999999999s)]
*  Let's just chill be on the sideline and wait this out. And what that would do is it could [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4191.68s)]
*  exacerbate a recession, right? Economic growth kind of slows, you know, companies like one of my [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4197.6s)]
*  like that company could go out of business, I don't know. You know, and I don't know what I [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4204.08s)]
*  would do because then I have like 50 companies mouths I have to feed. You know what I mean? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4209.92s)]
*  I don't have the money to do that. So it could create that. And then that would create negative [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4214.16s)]
*  growth. So how do you prevent it? This is one thing I'll tell you about the Trump administration, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4219.84s)]
*  which is totally different. Okay, I was a lifelong Democrat. Okay. I was a mega donor to the [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4227.4400000000005s)]
*  Democrats. You know, like dinner with Obama level donor, okay. I couldn't get a fucking phone call [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4232.56s)]
*  return from the White House to save my life. The only thing that happened to me was I made an [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4241.68s)]
*  off collar comment about like something in China. And I had the Biden administration like, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4246.4s)]
*  basically say something like essentially put out a press release, basically saying I was like, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4253.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, mean. That's all I got for millions of dollars that you know what I mean? Like, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4258.16s)]
*  for being honest. I mean, I was like, I was like, man, there's like a lot of problems in America. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4266.24s)]
*  Like, you know, talk to me about the fentanyl crisis before we talk about everything else. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4272.96s)]
*  Anyways, the Trump administration is totally different. There's not a single person there [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4276.88s)]
*  you can't get on the phone and talk to. I'll give you an example of this. A friend of mine's company [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4282.24s)]
*  was really impacted with these tariffs in a bad way. Okay, this is like a really amazing, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4288.08s)]
*  legitimate American business 150 year old business family owned all this stuff. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4293.28s)]
*  And I was able to call the deputy chief of staff and I said, Hey, can you talk to the CEO and just [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4298.4s)]
*  hear on the ground? He's like instantly put me on the phone. You know, my wife runs a pharmaceutical [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4303.04s)]
*  business. And you know, we wanted to make sure that the administration understood like all the [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4310.64s)]
*  implications for rare diseases and orphan drugs. What happens if these tariffs like cripple the [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4318.08s)]
*  R&D budgets because for there's 30 million Americans with rare diseases, rare disease means it's not [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4323.360000000001s)]
*  like diabetes or cancer. It's like 200,000 people or less, but there's 30 million of these Americans, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4328.72s)]
*  two thirds are kids. And the only companies that work on such small markets are these small biotech [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4334.72s)]
*  companies. And the tariffs create a lot of uncertainty. We were able to talk to all of them. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4341.92s)]
*  They were like, explain the issue. I want to understand it. So this is what's also totally [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4352.240000000001s)]
*  different, which I really give them a lot of respect. They are willing to debate it with you. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4356.56s)]
*  You can pick up the phone call phone and talk to these people. I've never had that experience, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4362.080000000001s)]
*  guys. I mean, look, I was like a senior person at Facebook could never get a meeting. I only [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4366.8s)]
*  met Obama once when he came to the thing. Then when I was running an investment fund successful, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4371.52s)]
*  I had dinner with Obama, but it was, you know, under the purpose of should I donate to the [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4375.92s)]
*  foundation? You know, I've donated millions of dollars to Democrats. I've never been to the [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4380.240000000001s)]
*  Oval. Okay. But the minute it's like here, it's like, hey, come to the White House, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4384.48s)]
*  explain these issues. Now you get on a plane, you get over there and they're like, explain it [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4390.639999999999s)]
*  and then they'll debate it. That's like, it's totally different. Sorry, devil's advocate. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4394.959999999999s)]
*  Should being a mega donor, I mean, I guess I get your point of view, but couldn't it also just be [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4399.599999999999s)]
*  like, no, we're not going to be biased just because a person donated money. We're not going to just [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4405.04s)]
*  answer the phone whenever he calls. You think, you think, you think I was like, you know, stupid [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4408.5599999999995s)]
*  five years ago and all of a sudden tried to like start to build national champions like now, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4413.44s)]
*  dude, man, I've been in the grind for fucking 25 years here, paying my taxes. I fucking paid, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4419.599999999999s)]
*  you know, more than most people. Yeah. So irrespective of the donation, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4423.599999999999s)]
*  I've been, I've been trying to do the right thing. Yeah. I, I, I wasn't trying to favor myself. It's [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4427.759999999999s)]
*  like, even just to explain, like, here's what's happening on the ground. Do you want to know? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4431.759999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. I'm curious in a 21, 22, you said you lost like almost $4 billion. And, but you said this [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4436.56s)]
*  time around, you were more prepared. What did you do that you're not hurting the way that all of us [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4443.52s)]
*  here are hurting stock market wise? No, I'm still hurting. Like I think my companies are, some of [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4448.88s)]
*  them are in real trouble and you know, there's going to be pain, but this time around I was able [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4453.12s)]
*  to take my ego out of it, not try to be the smartest guy in the room. And I was able to like [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4458.4s)]
*  understand how to just basically protect myself a little bit. How did you buy short positions? No, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4467.12s)]
*  but you can have protection. You can, you know, like that spread trade that I talked about the [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4474.24s)]
*  mag seven to the S and P, you know, you could take risk off by just selling stuff. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4481.2s)]
*  You know, it's not perfect by any means, but the level of confusion and pain that I went through [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4487.76s)]
*  in 2022. Now look, everything could change. I don't know. It could change tomorrow. I could [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4494.72s)]
*  just get run over tomorrow. But I tried to basically take the long view so that I, this, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4500.16s)]
*  because what happened in 2022 was I had a year and a half where I was constantly being forced [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4507.68s)]
*  to sell stuff at prices that I hated for things that I really cared about to fund other things [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4513.4400000000005s)]
*  that I really cared about. It is devastating. Like I don't look, just so you know, like I'm [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4522.4800000000005s)]
*  not running around with fucking 19 houses and all this other stuff, like jokes aside about the [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4528.320000000001s)]
*  sweaters and stuff. I live in one house. I have one car. You know what I mean? I, I own one home. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4532.96s)]
*  That's it. Like I, everything that I have, I direct to my businesses because I feel that [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4538.24s)]
*  these businesses can do good, useful things. And I just like the adventure of it. So this time around, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4544.4800000000005s)]
*  I wanted to not be crippled if this stuff was going to happen. And my point is that [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4549.84s)]
*  I was just like, risk off. Like I'm in this group chat with a bunch of my friends, a bunch of hoity [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4556.48s)]
*  toity folks, super brilliant guys. Man, it was just like risk on go. And I just kind of stayed [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4567.12s)]
*  quiet and in the cut every time I had the chance to kind of like, you know, even take the other [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4573.92s)]
*  side of it. I wouldn't, I just kept my head down and just kind of like try to, you know, not, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4578.08s)]
*  not get run over this time. So you just sold a lot. Like I want to know exactly what you did. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4584.48s)]
*  I just, I had a lot, the capital that I had, I did not put into the market. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4590.639999999999s)]
*  Got it. So you stayed liquid. So, so you and Warren Buffett are sitting on collectively [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4596.719999999999s)]
*  $300 plus billion dollars waiting for a nice old market collapse. What do you, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4602.96s)]
*  Well, let's be honest, he's sitting on $325. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4609.2s)]
*  I said $300 plus. You're the plus. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4613.12s)]
*  So what do you guys do with your $300 plus billion dollars once or even now, like the, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4618.719999999999s)]
*  you know, the market's in disarray. Do you start edging in? Like, what do you guys, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4625.12s)]
*  how do you deploy that capital? I don't, Warren and I are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4628.88s)]
*  Although we're theoretically doing the same thing, although he does it much better than me, but [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4637.44s)]
*  we both own businesses and we're both trying to own things that we understand. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4643.679999999999s)]
*  The difference is, is that he acts in the public markets at mega scale. I act in private markets [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4650.719999999999s)]
*  at, you know, what starts off at very minor scale. They can grow to be crazy big, but they start off [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4658.32s)]
*  small. So what I'm doing is trying to make sure. So I'll give you a couple of examples. I'm trying [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4664.16s)]
*  to build a national champion in the United States for batteries. I'm trying to build a national [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4669.36s)]
*  champion for rare earths amongst the United States and its allies. I'm trying to finish this thing on [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4676.639999999999s)]
*  breast cancer. I started an AI business that helps companies kind of just like run their businesses [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4682.96s)]
*  more efficiently. You know, I am the largest investor in the largest distributed solar company [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4688.24s)]
*  in the United States, residential solar. So I just, I'm trying to be there for my businesses. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4695.2s)]
*  When I can feed them a little bit of capital, I try to do the best that I can keep these companies [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4701.599999999999s)]
*  going, introduce them to other folks, even if they're scared, try to help convince them why they [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4706.8s)]
*  should be supporting these private companies. You know, so my game is very different than his. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4710.96s)]
*  You know, time will tell. I mean, you know, and then there are other businesses that will just, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4718.4s)]
*  you know, we'll see like, like in 2020, the craziest deal I did 2021. I had this kid, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4721.68s)]
*  he was a kid at the time, he's still young, but like DM me again, another example of like X. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4729.68s)]
*  And I didn't know who he was. And I looked at it and his name is Mr. Beast. And I was like, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4737.92s)]
*  who is this guy? So he was like, Hey, you want to talk? And I was like, Sure. So I did a zoom with [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4741.68s)]
*  him. And I just remember still to this day, like my kids walking by the zoom screen, because we [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4746.48s)]
*  were sheltering in place during COVID. And they saw Jimmy on screen and they just like, Oh my God, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4752.639999999999s)]
*  they ran into my little cabana that I use for meetings during COVID. And they were like, Oh [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4757.44s)]
*  my God, do you know that's Mr. Beast? And I was like, yeah. So I ended up working with Jimmy and [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4762.879999999999s)]
*  I, and I basically helped them create this business called Beast Industries, which is like the, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4766.5599999999995s)]
*  the kind of the organizing principle of all things beast, everything that he does. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4770.56s)]
*  But there are parts of Jimmy's business now that, you know, we're going to have to be very [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4778.08s)]
*  judicious about. We have to, we have to make sure we can support like the, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4782.64s)]
*  the stuff that he does in the food side, you know, that food stuff could get more expensive. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4785.92s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, a lot of the way that we make money and pay for stuff is to advertising, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4791.12s)]
*  right? Advertising could slow down a little bit if there's like a bit of a recession or like [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4795.84s)]
*  negative growth. I want to be in a position to support Jimmy if he needs some extra money. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4799.6s)]
*  So that's the game that I play. Like it's very tactical and in the weeds. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4806.240000000001s)]
*  What about stocks? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4812.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you, if you're asking me honestly, I'll give you the honest answer. I do not own [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4813.68s)]
*  a single public stock and have not since the end of 2023. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4818.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4824.4800000000005s)]
*  Will you buy in? Do you see this as an opportune time? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4827.36s)]
*  No. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4832.4s)]
*  Wow. Oh, shit. So you, oh, this is now we're getting somewhere good. So does that include like ETFs, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4833.4400000000005s)]
*  funds, like, I don't own a single, I have zero exposure to the public equity markets. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4840.16s)]
*  Are you not bullish on the equity market? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4849.52s)]
*  I am very bullish private equity business, meaning like, you know, private companies, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4851.52s)]
*  I have enormous exposure. But my point is the stock market for me is not where I quote unquote, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4856.72s)]
*  make money or create value. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4865.36s)]
*  Is that a function of a lack of confidence in it or just you want to put your time and energy [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4867.2s)]
*  towards the private sector? It's 80% the latter, 90% the latter and the 10% of it where I probably [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4872.32s)]
*  should have some exposure. I've just chosen not to. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4878.56s)]
*  Got it. Okay. Okay. You mentioned recession. Do you think we're headed towards one? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4880.72s)]
*  I thought that we were sneakily in one for a while. So this is the other thing that is important. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4886.320000000001s)]
*  We have a very brittle way of reporting data. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4893.68s)]
*  Our perception of where we are is constantly changing. So every Friday, the first Friday of [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4898.8s)]
*  every month, the financial markets get this thing called non-farm payrolls, which means, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4905.12s)]
*  tell me all the jobs that were created in America everywhere except on a farm. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4912.16s)]
*  And they use it to judge how healthy the economy is. That number has been basically unreliable [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4917.04s)]
*  for years. It'll come out with a number, then it gets revised the next month, then it gets revised. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4925.12s)]
*  It's the same with GDP. So what is GDP? It's just economic activity, the total sum of economic [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4932.72s)]
*  activity in America. What is that number? That's constantly being revised. So when I saw that, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4938.48s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is like really weird. Why are these numbers so fragile? And it turns out [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4945.92s)]
*  the way that we measure this stuff is very bad. Now, one consequence is that there is an emerging [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4951.52s)]
*  realization that a bunch of GDP was just the government spending a ton of cash in the economy, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4959.12s)]
*  hiring people, contracts, this and that. And it's not that those things are bad, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4967.84s)]
*  but they could be a lot of waste there. Like what you and I do for a dollar sometimes. You've seen [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4974.72s)]
*  these funny articles like the $700 waste paper bin and like the $900 umbrellas. How does the [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4983.36s)]
*  government end up buying these things? I don't know exactly, but all of that artificially props [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4991.679999999999s)]
*  up the economy. If you take that out and reset it to a more normal level, there is a belief [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=4996.4s)]
*  that we were actually sneakily in a low key recession like a year ago or two quarters ago. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5003.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that there's a reasonable chance that those people could be right. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5013.36s)]
*  Is there a reason or is it just coincidence that like the last 10 out of 11 recessions were [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5016.719999999999s)]
*  Republican administrations? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5022.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I think that the thing to keep in mind is I don't think presidents, any president [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5028.08s)]
*  who sits on top of one is necessarily the person that created one. And that's for everybody. So [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5038.08s)]
*  the next time a Democrat is in charge and there is a recession, you have to look back [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5049.76s)]
*  at the cumulative sum of the economic policy. So I think that the idea of like giving credit [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5056.16s)]
*  to a president for a stock market is just as dumb. So I would say the right thing to do is [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5063.76s)]
*  don't put the blame on the recession on the president. Don't also give them credit for [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5068.8s)]
*  the stock market. Neither of those things are things that they can actually control. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5072.72s)]
*  What they do is they add to the sum of all of the decisions that then get compounded [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5078.72s)]
*  in the future. Meaning like the great financial crisis, was it Obama's fault? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5086.56s)]
*  No. The great financial crisis was the sum of a bunch of decisions. And you could allocate a [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5093.52s)]
*  small amount of the responsibility all the way back to Reagan. But the majority of the [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5100.64s)]
*  responsibility was probably in Bush. And some even in Clinton, right? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5107.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I would say like the plurality of the responsibility was in Bush because there was a [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5112.64s)]
*  bunch of changes in the law that allowed people to just go ham in the financial market. So my [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5117.68s)]
*  point is it's not Obama's fault. So I just think it's important to just keep that in mind. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5124.8s)]
*  Okay. Before we get out of here, obviously, if you guys have any more questions, definitely [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5134.16s)]
*  want you to ask, but could you give us a potential outcome that is like, what is your hopeful outcome [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5137.84s)]
*  for this scenario with the tariff plan and the debt yield and American manufacturing in the future? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5146.96s)]
*  It can be optimistic. It can be based on whatever you feel. And then how does China's economy play [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5154.72s)]
*  into that now? There was a lot of talk about China's economy faltering, not only because of [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5160.16s)]
*  the age of the citizens, but also because of, oh, fuck, I wrote some notes on this, but that they [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5164.0s)]
*  were in some sort of like economic disarray. Well, China has, first of all, the Chinese are [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5170.4800000000005s)]
*  incredibly smart. They're incredibly well organized. They're incredibly prepared and [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5176.16s)]
*  they're incredibly top down. The problem that China has though, is after the last few years, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5180.5599999999995s)]
*  the amount of foreigners investing money into China has fallen off a cliff. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5186.32s)]
*  So in global economics, there's this thing called FDI, which is foreign direct investment. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5190.8s)]
*  We have it, China has it, Europe has it. It's when somebody that's outside of the border comes [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5197.28s)]
*  in with cash and says, I'm going to invest it here. So GM is like, I'm going to build a plant [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5202.56s)]
*  in Shenzhen, China. That's FDI. And for a whole host of reasons, I'm not smart enough to know them [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5207.360000000001s)]
*  all. It fell off a cliff in these last few years. So I think when some people think about what [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5215.6s)]
*  problems China has, the long-term, it's demographic. The one China policy, the one child policy was [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5221.6s)]
*  very problematic is the birth rate is very constrained. So that's really problematic for [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5228.24s)]
*  them. But in the short term, the real problem is around FDI. There's just not enough cash from [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5236.0s)]
*  foreigners who feel like the market is stable and predictable and offer a great return. So they're [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5241.599999999999s)]
*  not putting the money into China. So back to the United States. I think that everybody wants to get [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5246.639999999999s)]
*  a deal done. And I think it's an opportunity for Trump to rewrite these global rules [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5254.08s)]
*  and just say, guys, here's the new association. It'll probably be called the Mar-a-Lago Accords. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5263.92s)]
*  I bet dollars to doughnuts. That's 100%. I heard that mentioned and that was going to be my next [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5275.92s)]
*  question. What is Mar-a-Lago Accords? What I've been saying is that's the new framing [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5280.96s)]
*  document for how the world should work. And by the way, don't you want somebody who just basically [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5288.0s)]
*  does that on behalf of America? What is the downside of that? You know what the status quo is. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5297.36s)]
*  If you're happy with the status quo, I get it. You can debate it. But if the status quo isn't [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5304.24s)]
*  working for you, maybe there's like it's time to try something different and let it play out. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5310.08s)]
*  So my thought is, and by the way, like the status quo I benefited from, but I just don't think it's [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5315.44s)]
*  right. I don't think this dog hunts anymore. And I think you got to get America into a better place. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5321.76s)]
*  So you wait it out for six weeks and you start to do deals one by one, or you get them all in a room [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5325.76s)]
*  and say, guys, here's the term sheet. Here's my vision for the world. You know, you pay your share, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5334.24s)]
*  I pay my share. You guys get access to America. We have 330 million incredible Americans ready to [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5341.92s)]
*  buy everything that you make. You'll be prosperous, we'll be prosperous. But here are the terms. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5347.599999999999s)]
*  I just think like we should hope that that works. Let that play out. And if that plays out, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5355.28s)]
*  your taxes get cut to zero. That sounds pretty good. Interest rate payments. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5364.48s)]
*  I was gonna ask, is it possible Trump doesn't immediately start making deals? Does he just [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5370.32s)]
*  keep the tariffs on for longer windows of time? I think it makes a lot of sense for him to wait. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5374.4s)]
*  Now that's just me talking. Why? That is straight up game theory. I think it's like if so. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5379.599999999999s)]
*  In game theory, there's this concept called regret minimization. It's just like what it means like, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5387.44s)]
*  like, when you're going into a high stakes negotiation, right? Like, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5393.6s)]
*  how do you create the right psychological parameters in your opponent? Right. And [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5398.0s)]
*  I think that waiting just gives him enormous leverage. I just think it's like a bank account [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5405.68s)]
*  that compounds every day. Is it complicated for America? Yes. Is it complicated for the [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5413.12s)]
*  stock market? Yes. Is it more complicated for everybody else? Double yes. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5419.76s)]
*  And so again, you can't wait a year. But if you wait two, three, four weeks, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5426.88s)]
*  I mean, look, I'll tell one story. A friend of mine called me representing the president of a [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5433.360000000001s)]
*  country. And he's like, I need your help. I need some advice. I need to know what to do. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5442.72s)]
*  And I was like, well, what's what are your tariffs for American products? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5451.92s)]
*  And it was a non-trivally large number. And I said, bro, you got to cut that shit to zero. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5456.240000000001s)]
*  You should just proactively just cut it to zero. Don't ask. Just do it. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5463.12s)]
*  And then it turned out that they were going to buy an enormous number of planes from Airbus. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5468.0s)]
*  I was like, well, on the margins, you should just buy them from Boeing. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5477.2s)]
*  That's an American company. It's like 2% of all of our exports. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5481.2s)]
*  And then he's like, well, and we also buy a lot of energy. And I was like, well, I don't know, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5486.96s)]
*  maybe there's a concession to an American energy company to help you deliver that. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5490.96s)]
*  And I got off the phone and I looked at my wife and I was like, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5497.4400000000005s)]
*  that was surreal. But I was like, if there are 30 of those deals out of 80 to be done, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5502.64s)]
*  I'm telling you guys, it's a winning strategy. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5509.76s)]
*  That's really interesting. My assumption is that all of these foreign countries and their [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5515.12s)]
*  governments are already operating at high efficiency and already trying to get these deals. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5518.56s)]
*  I'm surprised to hear that they're not thinking entrepreneurially in that way. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5523.12s)]
*  I'm not going to slag world leaders. Winning an election is different than developing policy. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5529.28s)]
*  This is crazy. And I was like, all right, if these guys do that, and I was like, look, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5540.72s)]
*  if you guys want to write some letter, I'm happy to. Again, it's not like Trump or Steven Miller [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5543.599999999999s)]
*  or Suzy Wiles or Taylor Budowich. They're not hiding. Kevin Hassett, they're not hiding. Howard [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5551.36s)]
*  Lutnick, they'll take the call. But I just thought if this country shows up with that and said, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5555.5199999999995s)]
*  this is what we want to do, it's an incredible insight into the game theory, regret minimization. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5561.2s)]
*  They want to minimize their regret. They just want to get things back into a reasonable place [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5567.599999999999s)]
*  where they can get back to focusing on the things that they are prioritizing. That makes sense. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5573.599999999999s)]
*  So I just think this could actually work. Now, is that what's going to happen with China? No, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5579.52s)]
*  I'm not saying that. That's way more complex and above my pay grade. But I'm just saying if [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5585.36s)]
*  you get 30 of these, 40 of these countries, man, this is a big deal. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5589.92s)]
*  Do you think China comes to the table at all? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5594.16s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not smart enough to know. I don't know. I think so. I mean, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5596.16s)]
*  we're like frenemies. We have to make it work. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5602.24s)]
*  The getting is too good. Right. They need us to buy shit. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5606.64s)]
*  And right now we need them for some stuff too. So, you know, it's the honest truth. We need them as [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5611.360000000001s)]
*  well. Listen, Chamath, we appreciate you so much, man. Thank you very much for taking the time. We [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5616.320000000001s)]
*  hope you are right. Yeah. Okay. I also want to point out that you are so much taller in pictures [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5621.280000000001s)]
*  than you are on Zoom. I think it's the headroom. We need to do something with this camera. I thought [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5627.4400000000005s)]
*  you were 5'2", and I saw you in a picture. I'm 6'2". Yeah. You're a whole foot taller in real [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDt_zAlL8E&t=5632.32s)]
