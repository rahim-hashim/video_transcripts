# Charlamagne tha God On Diddy Tape, Catching Gay, and Nuclear War
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE)
*  What do white people do when the question or the thing they're thinking about could be offensive? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=0.0s)]
*  Probably keep it to yourself. There's only a couple of white people that can do that. Andrew Joe Rogan, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  maybe Theo Vaughn because he gives off autistic. So like I did a diary of CEO. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=9.92s)]
*  Oh man, the title was crazy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=15.44s)]
*  Crazy! What the f***! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=17.44s)]
*  Woman molested me as a kid, I cheated on my soul mate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=20.64s)]
*  Look at that thumbnail though. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  That's crazy! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=27.04s)]
*  It is wild that I'm not afraid, I can't be afraid of like somebody putting a d*** in my ass. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=28.72s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=33.76s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people that are afraid that they'll catch gay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=36.72s)]
*  Nobody knows for a fact you can't catch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=39.28s)]
*  Brother, eww. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=41.52s)]
*  I do have a friend that I do believe actually caught it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=42.56s)]
*  Talk to us! [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=44.56s)]
*  He did mushrooms, he started watching trans porn and then he started hooking up with dudes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=45.2s)]
*  Rewind the whole brain. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=48.88s)]
*  And then he stopped hooking up with dudes after like six months. He was like, I'm not gay anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=49.92s)]
*  What do you mean with trans women though? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=52.88s)]
*  Then he started hooking up with full dudes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=54.08s)]
*  Don't start with that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=55.44s)]
*  Oh okay, okay, okay. You don't want no car on it no more. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=56.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=58.63999999999999s)]
*  You wanted the cure. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=59.76s)]
*  You wanted the cure. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=60.64s)]
*  You wanted that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Alex found out I'm a civil rights hero. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=64.72s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=66.72s)]
*  Nah, we don't have to talk about it on air. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=67.92s)]
*  That seems braggadocious. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=70.16s)]
*  Off air I think was more appropriate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=71.28s)]
*  No, so you just had to say it right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=73.12s)]
*  No, off air. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=74.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to talk about it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=76.08s)]
*  Are we recording? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=76.72s)]
*  I don't want to talk about it on air. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=77.44s)]
*  Off air we can talk about I'm a civil rights hero. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=79.52s)]
*  Wait, how are you a civil rights hero? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=81.28s)]
*  Abroad. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=82.24s)]
*  It's not a story for me to tell. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=83.28s)]
*  I would never share something like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=84.4s)]
*  What happened? Who knows the story? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=85.12s)]
*  Alex hit me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=86.64s)]
*  Are we recording? I don't want to waste this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=87.6s)]
*  Yes, we're recording. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=89.44s)]
*  I was... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=90.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=90.8s)]
*  Oh, we're recording. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=91.3s)]
*  Oh wow. Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=92.32s)]
*  What a coincidence. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=93.36s)]
*  Oh, so I'll wait. I'll tell it after. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. You can tell it after. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=96.16s)]
*  If you guys want to know. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=96.72s)]
*  Nah, I was in Columbia this past week. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=97.36s)]
*  Which Columbia? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=99.12s)]
*  South Carolina. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=100.88s)]
*  Here's at the protest. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=101.6s)]
*  Here's at the protest. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=102.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=103.2s)]
*  Maryland. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  But so I was there. A good friend of mine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  He's from there but he's back and forth here and there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=108.72s)]
*  He's starting like a concierge business. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=112.0s)]
*  And so he was showing us around and it was like... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=113.76s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=116.72s)]
*  And then he talked about the time that Schultz went there a couple years ago. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=117.6s)]
*  And he was like, oh man, Schultz is such a good dude. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=120.48s)]
*  I always remember like Schultz was looking to buy his wife a ring or a pearl or something like that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=123.2s)]
*  And he was going into... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=129.76s)]
*  Emerald. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=131.04s)]
*  Oh, Emerald. Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=132.0s)]
*  He was going into this jewelry store. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=133.68s)]
*  And the concierge service also comes with security to make sure you're good 24 hours a day. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=135.76s)]
*  And the security is darker skinned. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=142.0s)]
*  They wouldn't let the security guy in the jewelry store. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=143.68s)]
*  And Schultz is like, well you guys just missed out on whatever amount of money he was going to pay for this ring. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=146.64s)]
*  Because I'm not going in if he can't go in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Cheese up, dude. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=153.6s)]
*  Cheese up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=154.55999999999997s)]
*  Now did you tell him... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  That doesn't have to do with race. That has to do with safety. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  He was like, I'm not going in the store. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=158.64s)]
*  No, it was safe in there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  In the store is safe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=161.92s)]
*  When he comes out, the security is still there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=162.88s)]
*  And then I thought I was like, damn, if he just did that with me in Sweden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=165.2s)]
*  You acting up though. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  It's never enough. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  You were acting up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=172.88s)]
*  It's never enough. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=173.6s)]
*  You were fighting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=174.72s)]
*  You lucky he didn't leave you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=176.48s)]
*  You like that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=177.76s)]
*  I just stood my ground. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=178.24s)]
*  They should understand that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=180.08s)]
*  You know who else feels that way? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=180.88s)]
*  Zimmerman says the same thing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=188.4s)]
*  I just stood my ground. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=190.16s)]
*  Damn, you got to be careful about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=191.28s)]
*  That's his point. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=192.88s)]
*  What are you missing the whole joke? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=193.76s)]
*  That's why I laugh like a fucking idiot. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=196.08s)]
*  Because I'm cool with a joke. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=197.68s)]
*  I was being serious. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=198.8s)]
*  I thought you were laughing because you were uncomfortable. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=201.28s)]
*  I was just like, oh, okay, wait a minute. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=202.64s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=205.76s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=206.16s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=206.32s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  I just want to clarify. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  The reason why I didn't want to offer the store my business is because I had asked the security guard [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  who happened to be black if when we went in to buy the emeralds while I was distracting [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=218.16s)]
*  them, if he could steal some jewelry. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  And they picked up on it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=226.32s)]
*  And then I just accused them of being racist, which I learned from Black people. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Remember when you guys are playing to rob a store and then the white people are like, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=232.08s)]
*  hey, why are you going to rob? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=235.12s)]
*  Why are you racist? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=236.32s)]
*  What's crazy is the security guard already hit that place before. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=237.44s)]
*  So they were like, no, not him. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=240.16s)]
*  They got a sign on the window. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=243.6s)]
*  We fucking got you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=244.88s)]
*  Damn, so you just assumed they were racist just because the guy had darker skin? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=245.84s)]
*  I did, bro. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=249.28s)]
*  Damn. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=250.72s)]
*  Well, not me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=251.36s)]
*  Your boy did. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  No, I did. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I did too. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=254.72s)]
*  I thought they weren't letting him in. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=255.68s)]
*  I don't believe this story. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=256.64s)]
*  Why not? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=257.52s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=258.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=259.44s)]
*  This actually happened? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=260.0s)]
*  Maybe I just didn't want to buy a fucking stupid ring from my wife. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=261.12s)]
*  Have you ever thought about that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=264.0s)]
*  And I used their racism to my advantage. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=265.12s)]
*  Smart. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=267.92s)]
*  Saved a lot of money. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=268.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=269.28s)]
*  Oh, that's so smart. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=269.84s)]
*  My wife doesn't need an emerald. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=270.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=271.84s)]
*  Because she got a diamond now, which is more expensive. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=272.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=274.08s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=274.58s)]
*  Tuck my shit. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=276.0s)]
*  Tuck my shit, Charlotte. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=278.72s)]
*  Tuck my shit, okay? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=280.8s)]
*  We got Charlamagne the God and the Motherfucker. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=282.88s)]
*  Break it, break it, break it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=284.8s)]
*  New book out now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=288.24s)]
*  Go cop it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=289.92s)]
*  Get Honest, A Dial-Line, Why Small Talk Sucks, Baby. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=290.72s)]
*  My third book, my third literary baby. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=293.44s)]
*  You know what's funny is that Small Talk specifically is something I'm so horrible at. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=295.36s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=301.6s)]
*  Because you don't have time for it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, yeah, explain. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=303.92s)]
*  We've talked about this before, but you have a good theory about why it is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  I never knew that I didn't like Small Talk until our discussion, by the way. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=308.16s)]
*  Because you like macro conversations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=311.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=313.6s)]
*  You're the type of person, Andrew comes in hot. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=314.0s)]
*  Whether it's in the group chat, whether it's on the podcast, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  whether it's on the stage, you want to get right to it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=319.52s)]
*  We don't have time for the pleasantries, the hi. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=323.12s)]
*  I mean, hi, greetings are cool. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=325.44s)]
*  But it's like- [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=327.2s)]
*  Then let's get into it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=327.76s)]
*  Then let's get into it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  I feel anxiety when we're not getting into it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=329.28s)]
*  Yes, because you know, why would we eat appetizers? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=332.4s)]
*  We're hungry. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  This is so funny. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  We want the meat. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=336.64s)]
*  Pause. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=337.76s)]
*  Bring the actual entree to the table. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=338.64s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=340.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=341.44s)]
*  Like, it's like everybody's just circling each other, waiting to see who's going to say what first. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=341.84s)]
*  I wonder- [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=346.64s)]
*  Who's going to set it off. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=347.2s)]
*  I wonder if this is why we got a log, like even so many years ago. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=348.16s)]
*  Because I remember like you would walk into a room and you would just drop some shit. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=352.72s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=355.92s)]
*  And then people would sometimes react like, oh my God, what's going on? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  And I would be relieved because I'd be like, finally, this fake bullshit that we've got going on right here is done. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Somebody said something that we all have to react to. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=367.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=369.44000000000005s)]
*  And we either react to it by like trying to ignore it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=370.0s)]
*  And then you get to call that person out by being fake. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=371.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=373.6s)]
*  Or that person just opened a floodgates and now we're laying in. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=374.0s)]
*  And everybody knows when you're doing it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=377.12s)]
*  Everybody knows when everybody's bullshitting each other. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  Do they? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=381.44s)]
*  Are there people? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=381.76s)]
*  I absolutely believe that they know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=382.4s)]
*  But what also this book does, it gives you permission to not even have the big talk if you don't want to. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=384.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=389.2s)]
*  So how do you tap out of that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=389.36s)]
*  Just simply say, I don't want to talk about this right now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=390.72s)]
*  I then, when you do that, I go further. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=392.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you understand. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=394.96s)]
*  When it comes to conversation, no does not mean no. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=396.32s)]
*  But that's true though. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=401.04s)]
*  I'm the same way, sadly, right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=402.08s)]
*  But then it's like, yo, you got to respect people's boundaries too. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=404.0s)]
*  But also, just tell people, I don't want to talk about this right now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=406.56s)]
*  Because you're like the nicest guy when you walk in a room. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=410.48s)]
*  You'll walk up to every single person in the room, make them all feel comfortable. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=412.48s)]
*  And then you'd be like, how much you pay in taxes last year? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=416.32s)]
*  I'm like, please don't beat me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=425.28s)]
*  Once you get that one person in conversation, everybody's gonna be like, what's so funny? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=431.92s)]
*  What's so interesting over there? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  The next thing you know, they all start coming on over and you're like, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=437.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=441.44s)]
*  Now we're about to have a party. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=442.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=443.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=443.68s)]
*  It's like, you ever see someone with autism doing that, like rock? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=444.08s)]
*  Jewish people? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=447.44s)]
*  Yeah, Jewish people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=448.64s)]
*  I feel like, I feel like. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=449.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=450.96s)]
*  This is so funny, because I do have a joke about how like Judaism and autism are like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=452.4s)]
*  the closest thing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=455.76s)]
*  Because when Jews pray, they're doing this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=456.88s)]
*  And when autistic people are just trying to hold back something, they're doing this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=458.4s)]
*  That's what I feel like is going on in your head, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=462.56s)]
*  Like in your head, I feel like when you're in that moment where everybody's bullshitting, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=465.92s)]
*  I feel like you just rock it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=469.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=470.56s)]
*  You're like, okay, who's gonna say it? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=470.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=472.0s)]
*  And diddy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=472.4s)]
*  And you know who knows that better than anybody? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=473.2s)]
*  My wife. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=476.24s)]
*  My wife would just be like, here you go. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=477.04s)]
*  It could be, I could say one thing and she'd be like, here you go. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=480.4s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=486.64s)]
*  It's like, because yo, I don't like it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=488.48s)]
*  Let's just have the conversation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=489.68s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=490.88s)]
*  What I'm trying to understand is most people, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=491.76s)]
*  okay, most people do small talk because they're anxious. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=494.0s)]
*  Most people do small talk because they don't have anything, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  because they're anxious and because they don't really have anything to say. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=498.88s)]
*  For sure. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=500.88s)]
*  But I also assume that it's inspired by, they just, they don't want to rock the boat. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  They want everybody to get along. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=505.44s)]
*  They want everything to just be fine in this moment. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  They have some anxiety. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  But I feel like we don't like small talk because it makes us anxious. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=509.84s)]
*  Yes, because I know that y'all actually want to be talking about something bigger, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=515.68s)]
*  especially us, because we're public figures. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  And people hear us talk about things or they've heard us say something on the radio. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=522.32s)]
*  I heard us say something on the podcast. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=525.84s)]
*  They've been waiting. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=527.12s)]
*  Who knows how long they have this conversation with us. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=528.08s)]
*  Now, sometimes because I'm an asshole, I'll stall you out. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=531.84s)]
*  Okay, go. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=536.08s)]
*  Meaning I'll just keep talking about everything else. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Everything else. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  Just because I know the joy is going to bring you to talk about whatever it is. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  You edge him. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=548.72s)]
*  You know what I really love? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=552.32s)]

*  We're going to talk about this when I'm ready to talk about it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=563.84s)]
*  Not when you're ready to talk about it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=566.0s)]
*  Do you remember, so it was like, it was like the day or two before my wedding. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=567.0400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, the day before. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=580.08s)]
*  This guy was getting drone struck on the way into the wedding. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=580.88s)]
*  People weren't even, there was no like, hey, how you doing? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=583.84s)]
*  They knew exactly who he was. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=586.56s)]

*  Like what? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=600.72s)]
*  But no, yes, but that's, I like that too, because that also, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=602.8s)]
*  when you walk into a room full of people that you may not know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=606.24s)]
*  it makes it easier to open up conversation. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=609.84s)]
*  So much better, let's go. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=611.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  They have something they want to talk to you about. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=613.2s)]
*  So once again, there's no small talk. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=616.4s)]
*  What do white people do when they don't want to have small talk, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=618.48s)]
*  but the question or the thing they're thinking about could be offensive? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=623.84s)]
*  What would you suggest to them? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  I would say, depends, I would find somebody that you trust, or you think you can trust. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=633.36s)]
*  But what if they're not there? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=638.48s)]
*  White person in a room full of black people. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=640.4s)]
*  Probably keep it to yourself. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=641.44s)]
*  So you're saying just do a small talk? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=642.72s)]
*  What if they need, what if they're like, you know, why are you guys responsible for a murder? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  If you think it's going to go wrong, just don't even bring it up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  But you can't, you start rocking, you're getting the rock. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=655.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're the white you. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=658.48s)]
*  They're like a white you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=660.16s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=660.88s)]
*  They gotta do it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=661.52s)]
*  You can't, you're not, see that's the privilege of being black. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=662.08s)]
*  Oh, so you guys just got to stay. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  There's only a couple of white people that can do that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=666.24s)]
*  Andrew, Joe Rogan, maybe Theo Vaughn because he gives off autistic. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=668.88s)]
*  Is that why all these celebrities are pretending they're retarded now? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  So they can get away with saying things? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=686.88s)]
*  Do you have an excuse? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=688.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=689.44s)]
*  I mean, I think you're probably a little, you know, specter me. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=690.0s)]
*  I was in the slow class for real though. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=692.72s)]
*  No, I was. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=694.32s)]
*  No, I mean, emotionally retarded. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=695.12s)]
*  I don't mean you're one of the smartest people I've ever met, but emotionally you got a little ass burger. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=696.64s)]
*  But I know I failed a standardized test and I was in one of those classes for like a semester. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=700.2399999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=704.56s)]
*  I was in the, I was in the, I was in the class with the people I used to tease on. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  What did you, what did you learn? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=708.4s)]
*  Retrubation doesn't work just for a summer. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=709.3599999999999s)]
*  I failed a standardized test and they put me in this class with kids who had other learning disabilities. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=712.4s)]
*  So tell me, what did you learn from that? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=718.4799999999999s)]
*  That like what? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=719.92s)]
*  They leave the motherfuckers alone because they're strong. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=720.64s)]
*  Okay, listen, I used to tease this one kid so much. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=723.12s)]
*  His name, his name, I don't even want to say his name because he, who knows? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=726.88s)]
*  He's gotten stronger now. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  He might not even be Flo no more. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  He might have just been a high schooler. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=732.4799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, we used to call him Peter Pan because whenever you went up to him and whispered, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=735.92s)]
*  Peter Pan is dead, he would lose his shit. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=740.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, Peter Pan is not dead. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=744.64s)]
*  Like he would go crazy. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  So we called him Peter Pan. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=747.28s)]
*  So we was in chorus class and like we were singing like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=748.64s)]
*  and I changed it to like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=753.76s)]
*  He'd lose his fucking mind. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=756.4799999999999s)]
*  It's there you fucking idiot. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=758.0s)]
*  It's there. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=759.76s)]
*  So when I ended up in the class with this kid, right, even though I really felt bad for myself, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  right, because I'm in this class, I'm like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=766.88s)]
*  Yeah, because you're not retarded. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=769.28s)]
*  No, you're in a retarded class. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=770.56s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=771.68s)]
*  Your mom is a teacher. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=773.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  So this kid, they would have these kids at the computer. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  We'd be sitting at the desk. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  They let the retards play with the computers? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=779.68s)]
*  Would they just start? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  It was like organ trail. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=782.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't plugged in, though. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  By the way, I don't know what they were doing on the computers. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=787.28s)]
*  I just remember they used to be on the computers. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=788.8s)]
*  And so I'm sitting behind him and he's typing and I'm just whispering to him going crazy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=790.24s)]
*  And he's losing his mind, but I'm acting like I'm not doing nothing, right? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=794.9599999999999s)]

*  He might be too retarded to know. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=814.24s)]
*  I didn't even know he knew my name. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=815.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=817.52s)]
*  So not only did he say my full name, he hit me with a joke that everybody used to hit me with in school. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=817.92s)]

*  You're right. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=828.16s)]
*  If he was like a racist person, that's the moment where you're at your boiling point and you drop the word. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=829.4399999999999s)]

*  That's what the media is going to pass around. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1135.2s)]
*  Charlamagne and his new books at XYZ. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1138.32s)]
*  And we live in an era where people take everything, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1138.8s)]
*  I don't want to say out of context, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1141.52s)]
*  but they just put things through their lens and their filter. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1142.8s)]
*  Basically, they put things through the lens of what they know [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1145.68s)]
*  is going to get their website the most clicks, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1147.44s)]

*  You've heard me tell this story a million times. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1210.0s)]
*  I've written about it in my books. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1212.72s)]
*  Look at the thumbnail, though. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1214.48s)]

*  I hope not. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1227.2s)]
*  That shit was crazy. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1228.0s)]
*  I felt so bad because I told him to go on that show, too. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1228.96s)]
*  Is that story even in this book? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1231.2s)]
*  That was from old books. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1233.36s)]
*  Oh, I mean, no, no, no, no. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1234.56s)]
*  I do because I talk about in this book, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1236.48s)]
*  I talk about my father telling me about how [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1238.08s)]
*  when I confronted him about cheating on my mom, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1241.2s)]
*  and he was like, you only got one girlfriend? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1243.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1244.56s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1244.8s)]
*  Can I just say that's an all-time response? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1245.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's really unbelievable. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1248.0s)]
*  Charlamagne goes to his dad and confronts him [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1249.28s)]
*  for cheating on his mom. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1252.3999999999999s)]

*  what are you, gay? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  You only got one? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1257.28s)]
*  Nah, this is the 90s. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1259.28s)]
*  He didn't say gay. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1260.32s)]
*  He didn't water his dad. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1261.12s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1262.96s)]
*  He's acting like the pope. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1265.68s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1266.72s)]
*  He was a pope. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1267.3600000000001s)]
*  Yo, Mark gets me up last night late. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1268.88s)]
*  He goes Catholicism is back. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1271.44s)]
*  Damn. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1273.68s)]
*  The boys are back, bro. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1274.16s)]
*  But that's how you get away. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  The foreign Catholicism for me? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1278.64s)]
*  Catholics, Christians. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a, oh, OK, OK. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1280.72s)]
*  I feel like I got one of those. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1281.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1285.28s)]
*  But why is it back? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1286.5600000000002s)]
*  Because they used to use gay slurs? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1287.68s)]
*  I mean, Catholicism was running the world for a long time. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  They kind of lost influence. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1291.52s)]
*  But also, this pope got real soft. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1293.6000000000001s)]
*  And the pope got soft. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1295.44s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1296.72s)]
*  I know that you don't want Catholics to be homophobic or whatever. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1297.84s)]
*  At the same time, if they all were homophobic, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1301.68s)]
*  they would stop molesting the boys. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1304.08s)]
*  So in a way, Catholic homophobia makes it safer for altar boys. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1305.52s)]
*  That's true. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1310.72s)]
*  Maybe that's why he's doing it. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1311.84s)]
*  Chew on that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1313.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what they told the altar boys. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1317.28s)]
*  I think homophobia within Catholicism [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1317.84s)]
*  is the best possible thing right now for the safety of young boys. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1321.2s)]
*  It's essential. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1323.68s)]
*  It should be mandatory. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1324.48s)]
*  For the safety of young boys. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  I care about the safety of young boys. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1326.48s)]
*  Most people that are closeted act like that towards gay people anyway. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1328.0s)]
*  Most people that are closeted act homophobic. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1333.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1335.2s)]
*  Because they're just ashamed about being gay. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1335.68s)]
*  Yeah, but you could also just be homophobic, can't you? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1337.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1339.6000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes that's just homophobic. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1340.0s)]
*  I don't know any real homophobic people, yo. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1341.04s)]
*  I am. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1342.64s)]

*  I know people who get accused of being homophobic. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1346.88s)]
*  I don't know people that are like, I hate gay people. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1349.44s)]
*  I don't like the lifestyle. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1352.16s)]
*  What about people? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  Because even the religious folks mask it under the guise of religion. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1354.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1358.8s)]
*  I don't. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1359.52s)]

*  Did you just stop hanging out with all your black friends or what happened? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1362.4s)]
*  We've never been homophobic. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1364.72s)]
*  They use the F word for people that aren't gay. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1367.44s)]
*  I actually think it is homophobia in terms of the fear of it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1369.44s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people that are afraid that they'll catch gay. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1374.3200000000002s)]

*  And then the person that he stops or the people he stops go English. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1394.72s)]

*  Nobody knows for a fact you can't catch it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1441.52s)]
*  I don't think it's contagious. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1443.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1444.8799999999999s)]

*  Now I throw a list of the shit. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  There had to be a point in Bottom's life where Bottom was like, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1600.08s)]
*  I was scared of that dick even though I was attracted to it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1604.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1607.12s)]
*  But then when they started taking that shit, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1607.36s)]
*  they weren't afraid no more. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1609.44s)]
*  So there has to be an initial fear. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1610.72s)]
*  So was that Bottom homophobic? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1612.24s)]
*  He was. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1614.0s)]

*  Probably. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1615.1200000000001s)]
*  Initially, yeah. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1615.6000000000001s)]

*  ugh, something happened to you, bro. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1810.48s)]

*  Yeah, like why are you so, like why do you have to prove [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1814.0800000000002s)]

*  Some people would say because being gay is gross. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1820.5600000000002s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1824.48s)]
*  Who would say that? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1825.28s)]
*  Some people would say that. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1825.8400000000001s)]
*  See the Pope or, you know. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1827.8400000000001s)]

*  Hey, show me and get honest or die lying. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1831.92s)]
*  Get honest or die lying on your stomach. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1833.2s)]
*  But this is what this is about. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1840.64s)]
*  It's okay to be who you are. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1842.24s)]
*  Be who you are. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1843.76s)]
*  Especially, it's fun to be who you are in 2024. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1844.32s)]
*  Unless you're homophobic and then you have to fake it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1847.3600000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1849.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1849.8400000000001s)]
*  But if you're, I don't think people are faking it no more. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1850.0s)]
*  You think they're out there in the open with it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1851.8400000000001s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1853.52s)]
*  But nobody do know. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1854.32s)]
*  If the Pope has decided throwing the F word around like he's not. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1855.1200000000001s)]
*  He said it in Italian, it was different. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1857.44s)]
*  He said it in Italian. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1858.96s)]
*  Dude, the Italian word for it is phenomenal. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1859.92s)]
*  Pugia le. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1861.44s)]
*  No, it's not like that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1862.48s)]
*  Actually, I don't know how to pronounce it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1863.44s)]
*  Let me find it. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1864.5600000000002s)]
*  I think it's frago sinni. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1865.2s)]
*  What is it? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1867.68s)]
*  It's frocci joane. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1868.72s)]
*  Because frocci means gay. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1870.96s)]
*  I thought frocci was a drink. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1873.52s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1874.8000000000002s)]
*  Frocci joane. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1875.0400000000002s)]
*  Frocci is a Starbucks? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1876.0800000000002s)]
*  Frocci joane. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  What is the frocci? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1878.64s)]
*  That's how you say it in like derogatory way. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  Am I tripping right? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1881.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1882.96s)]
*  It's what they call a drink. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1883.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1884.3200000000002s)]
*  Frocci joane. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1885.0400000000002s)]
*  Hold up. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1886.8000000000002s)]
*  So Starbucks is homophobic. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1887.2s)]
*  We know that. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1889.3600000000001s)]
*  We know that. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1891.2800000000002s)]
*  We've known that about Starbucks. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1892.4s)]
*  So hold up. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1893.36s)]
*  Starbucks is out here serving drinks [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1893.92s)]
*  that are Italian gay slurs. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1896.8799999999999s)]
*  And nobody says anything. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1899.84s)]
*  You never had a double venti. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1901.44s)]
*  With extra cream. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1906.96s)]
*  And a long straw. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1909.92s)]
*  That is gay. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1912.4s)]
*  If you choose a long straw for a short drink, you get. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1913.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1915.12s)]
*  Let's just call that out right now. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1915.6s)]
*  If you choose the long because it's even wider. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1917.2s)]
*  For a small drink at Starbucks, you are homosexual. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1920.32s)]
*  That's fact. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1923.28s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1924.24s)]
*  Can we write a law about that? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1929.04s)]
*  LGBTQ community, man. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1932.1599999999999s)]
*  What are you about to show me? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1934.24s)]
*  This shit froze really quick. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1937.52s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1938.8s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1939.28s)]
*  You had y'all bricked up. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1940.08s)]
*  You got to leave the room. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1940.96s)]
*  He's like, that's why my finger's longer. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1958.8s)]
*  I need to try this one. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1961.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1963.2s)]
*  So Charlamagne, how is the media going to use everything that you've said [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1963.44s)]
*  to benefit whatever platform they're on? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1968.8s)]
*  Is that stressful? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1974.96s)]
*  Have you guys seen this? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1977.84s)]
*  I should put context to it. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1978.72s)]
*  Obviously, I'm ready. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1980.08s)]
*  But Charlamagne will be used by every side of the media to prove whatever their agenda is. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1980.8799999999999s)]
*  So is there a new stress that comes with that now? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1986.8s)]
*  The right does a phenomenal job of pushing their narratives. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1990.8799999999999s)]
*  Whatever their narrative is. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1994.0s)]
*  You know, for the past few months, it's been black people are moving away from Democrats. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=1995.92s)]
*  Donald Trump has, like, what? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2001.28s)]
*  22% of black people say right now they'll vote for Donald Trump. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2002.64s)]
*  I think that's a little overstated. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2005.76s)]
*  But anything that pushes that narrative, they're for it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2007.04s)]
*  And it's been like this probably for the past eight, nine months. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2012.4s)]
*  So if I'm critical of the Democratic Party, they lock in. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2014.64s)]
*  Regardless of anything else I say about Trump, they lock in on that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2018.16s)]
*  Do you think Fox has assigned a person to your media? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2021.1200000000001s)]
*  Meaning it's just an intern and it's their job to find a quote? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2025.2s)]
*  It's so targeted. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  A brilliant idiots fan, probably. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2032.24s)]
*  Low-key, I wonder. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2034.96s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2036.0800000000002s)]
*  Because it's like- [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2036.8s)]
*  I think so. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2037.2s)]
*  Because it happens the same day. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2037.68s)]
*  It's the era we live in, too, though. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2040.16s)]
*  But here's the thing that was so interesting about that- [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2042.16s)]
*  I don't think Fox news is checking breakfast club. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2044.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2046.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2046.96s)]
*  I mean, depends who's on. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2047.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it's not like this out of the ordinary, right? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2048.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like when we have political guests on, right? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2050.96s)]
*  And we do do a segment every morning called Front Page News. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2054.16s)]
*  So you kind of just got to tune into that to hear what the political takes are, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2057.44s)]
*  for the most part. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2061.3599999999997s)]
*  But I think what's interesting is the left never finds a way to create its own narratives. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2062.3999999999996s)]
*  The left just responds to whatever the right puts out there. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2067.52s)]
*  And then calls them racist or sexist or- [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2071.52s)]
*  Yes, or calls me a MAGA supporter or whatever. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2073.44s)]
*  So I could literally say in the same sense, this happened on John Carlyle's show. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2076.16s)]
*  I can say Donald Trump was a threat to democracy. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2079.44s)]
*  You know, he wanted to suspend the Constitution, overthrow the results of an election. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2082.0s)]
*  But Joe Biden's an uninspiring candidate with no main character energy. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2084.96s)]
*  Fox don't give a fuck about that first part. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2088.32s)]
*  That's the second part. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2089.84s)]
*  Give me that. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2090.8s)]
*  This is what I want. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2091.2s)]
*  I want the uninspiring candidate main character energy. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2092.0s)]
*  And so everybody on the left replies to that [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2094.16s)]
*  as if I didn't just say this other stuff about Trump. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2096.56s)]
*  It's the strangest thing in the world. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2099.28s)]
*  But what I'm realizing is, especially after- [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2102.24s)]
*  I knew this already, but this week showed me a lot [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2104.64s)]
*  because all the different type of press were like, I did The View. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2107.36s)]
*  I did like CBS This Morning with L.K. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2109.44s)]
*  That clip was crazy, dog. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2111.44s)]
*  That View clip, you handled it incredibly well. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2113.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what they wanted me to say. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2116.08s)]
*  Can you give context to the clip for everybody? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2117.6s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2119.84s)]
*  I said that I'm not endorsing anybody for president this year. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2120.8s)]
*  And you know, Sonny from The View basically was like, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2124.32s)]
*  it was irresponsible of me to do that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2127.76s)]
*  And she said, this isn't the time to sit this out. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2129.68s)]
*  This ain't the election to sit out. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2131.92s)]
*  I never said I was sitting out. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2133.12s)]
*  Never once have I said I'm sitting out. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2135.36s)]
*  Never once have I said I'm not voting. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2136.96s)]
*  None of these things have happened. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2138.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2140.32s)]
*  All I'm simply doing is being critical of both parties. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2140.8s)]
*  Which you should. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2144.16s)]
*  And my interest this year is- [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2144.96s)]
*  One of my interests is preserving democracy. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2146.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2148.88s)]
*  So I'm gonna vote for whoever I think can preserve democracy. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2149.12s)]
*  But- [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2153.52s)]
*  The Democratic candidates are so weak [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2154.0s)]
*  that their only hope is vote against Trump. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2155.76s)]
*  It's so silly. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2158.08s)]
*  That's all they have. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2158.96s)]
*  But I say, I've told other personalities in media [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2159.84s)]
*  that y'all spend so much time talking about how bad Trump is. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2162.4s)]
*  You never tell me any of the good things that- [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2166.48s)]
*  What you are. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2167.76s)]
*  That Biden is doing. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2168.48s)]
*  Do it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2169.52s)]
*  And then you wonder why people say, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2170.0s)]
*  well, what the hell is Joe Biden doing? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2171.36s)]
*  Or what the hell is Vice President Harris doing? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2173.04s)]
*  Very true. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2174.4s)]
*  I can't find out from the people who support them [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2175.2s)]
*  because your whole feed is how bad Trump is. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2177.2s)]
*  But to what Akash is saying, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2179.6s)]
*  I think their whole angle is vote for not him. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2180.72s)]
*  And if your angle is vote for not him, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2183.44s)]
*  you just gotta make him as bad as possible. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2184.8s)]
*  Make him super radioactive. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2186.64s)]
*  Biden is uninspiring, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2188.08s)]
*  so I can't inspire you to vote for him in my brain. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2189.12s)]
*  Democrats don't believe in Biden. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2191.28s)]
*  You know what the truth is? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2192.8s)]
*  It's not even about none of that. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2193.92s)]
*  These motherfuckers care about ratings. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2195.44s)]
*  Oh, very- [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2196.88s)]
*  They care about clicks. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2197.52s)]
*  They care about engagement. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2200.08s)]
*  And the reality is Donald Trump moves the needle. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2200.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2203.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2203.68s)]
*  And not only does Donald Trump move the needle, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2204.32s)]
*  people who are supposedly left-leaning, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2206.32s)]
*  criticizing Democrats moves the needle. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2209.84s)]
*  You know why? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2212.4s)]
*  Because it gets motherfuckers going on social media. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2213.12s)]
*  So if I saw the whole context of what Charlemagne said, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2216.48s)]
*  fuck the whole context of what he said. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2220.16s)]
*  Let's just take this part of him saying, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2221.92s)]
*  Joe Biden's uninspiring. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2223.68s)]
*  And then let's retweet it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2225.2s)]
*  And somebody's going to say, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2226.7999999999997s)]
*  this is the type of rhetoric [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2227.9199999999996s)]
*  that's going to get Donald Trump elected. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2228.8799999999997s)]
*  And so then it turns into Charlemagne [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2230.3999999999996s)]
*  don't know what the fuck you talking about politics, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2232.24s)]
*  to Charlemagne made little mama cry, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2233.68s)]
*  to Charlemagne homophobic, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2235.68s)]
*  Charlemagne's transphobic, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2237.04s)]
*  Charlemagne was- [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2238.0s)]
*  Now it's just this whole thing about me in a lot of ways, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2238.8799999999997s)]
*  but it all goes right back to that one original clip [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2243.2s)]
*  that's now probably got 100,000 retweets, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2246.16s)]
*  a million plus views. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2250.3199999999997s)]
*  They make it look like you're supporting the other side. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2251.9199999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2254.56s)]
*  And then when it looks like you're supporting the other side, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2255.04s)]
*  they have to make you radio active. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2257.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2259.6s)]
*  They got to attack your character. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2259.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2261.12s)]
*  To basically cut your legs out from under you [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2261.52s)]
*  so you don't inspire influence people [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2264.0s)]
*  to support the other side. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2265.84s)]
*  When in reality, if they just played the whole clip, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2267.04s)]
*  everything would have been explained. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2270.8s)]
*  Everything would have been explained. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2272.08s)]
*  And it probably would have been a better discussion. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2273.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, they don't want good discussions. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2275.2799999999997s)]
*  They just want to act out timbers. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2276.72s)]
*  They don't. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2277.84s)]
*  The one thing I don't understand is [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2278.16s)]
*  The Rock also said he's not endorsing anybody. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2279.84s)]
*  Taylor Swift also said she's not endorsing anybody, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2282.16s)]
*  but that I feel no one was outraged about. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2284.24s)]
*  Because they need the black vote, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2286.72s)]
*  and Charlamagne is influential within the black community. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2288.16s)]
*  So him not endorsing. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2290.56s)]
*  Taylor Swift. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2291.68s)]
*  The Rock ain't black to America. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2292.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2294.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2296.08s)]
*  The Rock is the Rock. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2297.04s)]
*  Not the Rock. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2298.48s)]
*  That's true. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2299.2799999999997s)]
*  But if The Rock dropped the N-word, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2300.24s)]
*  we'd be like, hold on. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2301.68s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2302.7999999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2303.2799999999997s)]
*  You'd have to remind us. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2304.08s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, his dad is black. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2305.12s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, it's my bad. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2306.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2308.08s)]
*  That would be, he got to do that business. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2308.56s)]
*  He got to do that business. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2311.12s)]
*  And you smell it. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2312.4s)]
*  So this guy had a whole rap song, didn't say the N-word. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2313.52s)]
*  He knows people don't think he's black. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2319.6s)]
*  I feel like Drake's more black than The Rock. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2320.32s)]
*  Like the people. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2322.16s)]
*  Yeah, the people. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2322.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2323.44s)]
*  More power. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2323.76s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  And even. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2324.72s)]
*  Give him a minute. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2326.72s)]
*  He'll get it back. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2327.36s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2327.92s)]
*  Not at this current moment. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2329.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, true. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2330.56s)]
*  Yeah, not at this current moment. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2331.12s)]
*  But it is interesting, because even when I did Fox News, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2332.4s)]
*  I did Brian Kilmeade's show on Fox. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2335.52s)]
*  I did, I'm doing Gutfeld. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2337.68s)]
*  Well, we're taping this through this. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2339.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm doing Gutfeld tonight. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2340.96s)]
*  And the thing I've realized about them, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2343.2799999999997s)]
*  they're not trying to push a narrative, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2346.72s)]
*  because they already know what their narrative is going to be. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2348.3199999999997s)]
*  I want the left to learn from the right [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2351.04s)]
*  and start just pushing the narrative that you want out there. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2353.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the only way. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2358.08s)]
*  What would it be if you were a Democratic strategist? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  What would you push out there that are the good things they're doing? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2361.2799999999997s)]
*  For President Biden right now, I would be talking about the student loan [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2364.48s)]
*  debt a lot, because those are the things that impact everyday people. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2367.44s)]
*  Those are the things that people can point to. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2372.64s)]
*  I know people who've gotten their student loan debt wiped away. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2374.4s)]
*  I know people personally who have gone to their accounts, $20,000, gone. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2376.88s)]
*  What does that mean, wiped away? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2380.8s)]
*  I don't understand what that means. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2382.48s)]
*  You just don't have to pay it back. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2383.44s)]
*  You don't have to pay it back. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2384.32s)]
*  It's over. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2385.04s)]
*  Your bank's gone. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2385.36s)]
*  But does the bank pay the L, or do taxpayers pay back the bank? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2386.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2391.68s)]
*  Because I'm trying to understand. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2392.56s)]
*  Like, that's true. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2393.6s)]
*  What I assume it is, is it's not wiped away. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2395.28s)]
*  What I assume it is, is that burden is now displaced across 300 million Americans. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2398.1600000000003s)]
*  Miles, it seems like you have the answer. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2403.28s)]
*  A lot of Biden's things are helping people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2405.52s)]
*  Miles, hold on now. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2408.8s)]
*  Are you answering the question that we're talking about right now, or something wrong? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2410.0s)]
*  All the debt that's getting wiped away is Biden helping people sign up for programs [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2414.32s)]
*  that were government-sponsored programs that they didn't know they could get on, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2418.96s)]
*  that they worked in a public sector for 10 years, and then their debt gets wiped away. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  But the question is, what happens to the debt? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2426.7999999999997s)]
*  Who's paying for it, and what are you saying? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2428.56s)]
*  Somebody has to pay to take care of it? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2430.24s)]
*  My assumption is that the American taxpayer shares that burden. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2431.3599999999997s)]
*  Because there's no way the banks are just going to go, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2435.7599999999998s)]
*  well, we'll just not take those few hundred million dollars. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2437.6s)]
*  But like, fine. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2440.48s)]
*  So let's say, for example, they do Teach for America, debt gets wiped away. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2441.44s)]
*  I guess that's the government being like, what you do is noble enough in our eyes [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2445.2s)]
*  that we can pay off this. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2449.2s)]
*  We'll take care of this debt for you. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2450.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2451.2s)]
*  And that's coming out of government coffers. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2451.68s)]
*  And then when we talk about the government pays for something, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2453.2s)]
*  they don't have money. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2456.56s)]
*  That's our money. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2457.3599999999997s)]
*  So we pay for it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2458.16s)]
*  Sometimes, but sometimes they can reallocate money from a different program. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2459.12s)]
*  But our money. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2462.3199999999997s)]
*  No, but say a program's not, oh, yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2462.96s)]
*  No, taxpayer money. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2464.56s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is we look at it like the debt is wiped away. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2465.44s)]
*  It's not wiped away. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2468.96s)]
*  It's just put on taxpayers. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2470.08s)]
*  Just add it to the deficit, and we pay later. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2472.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's also true. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2474.08s)]
*  And if it's redistributed from money that's already there to an ineffectual program, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2474.8799999999997s)]
*  then that's a positive thing. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2478.7999999999997s)]
*  Dude, they got rid of the non-compete clauses. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2480.0s)]
*  I'm not saying don't do it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2482.0s)]
*  I'm not saying don't do it. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2483.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm just saying let's say what is happening. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2484.56s)]
*  It's not like the banks are taking the L. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2487.52s)]
*  I think that you'd have unanimous support if we all found out the banks were taking the L. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, Wells Fargo's going to have to eat that half a billion dollar. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2493.28s)]
*  Hell, yeah, run it up. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2495.92s)]
*  It ain't that. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2497.2000000000003s)]
*  But I mean, it's true. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2497.84s)]
*  Chome in the God, Mark, Alex Media, Akash, Dove, Miles Shifty, Andrew's also going to have to pay taxes. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  But couldn't you do that with everything? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2505.36s)]
*  If a politician was like, I'm going to cut taxes, he could also be like, hey, I'm going to stop giving as much money to poor people. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2506.96s)]
*  You're just not going to do that. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2513.12s)]
*  I'm going to make sure some programs get cut. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2514.32s)]
*  Then kids are not going to get breakfast at school. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2515.92s)]
*  Makes sense to me. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2518.0s)]
*  So basically, you're just framing it in a different way, right? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2519.2s)]
*  But you can do that with anything. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  If a politician gets up there and says, hey, I'm going to cut taxes, what he's also saying is there's a lot of government programs that are not going to get funded. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2523.36s)]
*  Some underprivileged kids might not go to school because I'm cutting taxes, so you all save money, but there's less to go to them. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2530.08s)]
*  You can do that with anything. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2534.48s)]
*  What I would, the difference I would say is that we don't know if there's an increase in taxes to accommodate that burden. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2535.28s)]
*  So that would be the difference between what you just said. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2546.48s)]
*  Or cut spending. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2549.0400000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2550.0s)]
*  It's not cutting taxes. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2551.0400000000004s)]
*  It's cutting spending or just adding to the debt. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  Which they're never really doing, by the way. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2555.36s)]
*  They're never going to cut spending. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2556.5600000000004s)]
*  They're never really cutting spending. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2557.44s)]
*  That just sounds good to say. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2558.6400000000003s)]
*  They don't cut spending, bro. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2559.84s)]
*  They just keep printing more money. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2561.1200000000003s)]
*  They really don't. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2562.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2563.52s)]
*  They don't cut spending. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2564.1600000000003s)]
*  So I guess, I don't know, and I wonder what happens for people who they just finished paying off their student debt, and now they're like, holy shit. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2565.84s)]
*  If I waited 10 years, then it wouldn't have happened. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2573.44s)]
*  I like seeing everyday working class people get that kind of relief. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2576.56s)]
*  You can't lose with that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2581.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2582.96s)]
*  And that's one of the things that people can point to the same way when everybody talks about Trump, when they bring up the stimulus checks and the PPP loans and all of that stuff like that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2583.44s)]
*  Those are things that they can point to where they were provided relief. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2592.64s)]
*  Motherfuckers will never forget when you provided them relief. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2597.2799999999997s)]
*  And think about when they got that relief during the worst time that we've probably experienced in American history. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2600.24s)]
*  Now, granted, they got the relief because of that worst time, because of that pandemic, but they don't give a fuck. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2606.7999999999997s)]
*  If you were three, four months behind on bills and all of a sudden you got a check in the mail, you'll never forget who gave you that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2612.48s)]
*  100%. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2619.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's what all presidents, all election officials. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2620.48s)]
*  So what you're saying is Biden is trying to buy the election. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2622.96s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2625.04s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2626.0s)]
*  Andrew Yang tried to. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2626.48s)]
*  Universal basic income, you shit. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2628.48s)]
*  That's all. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2629.84s)]
*  What do we care about in this country? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2630.4s)]
*  We want money. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2632.08s)]
*  Guns. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2632.88s)]
*  Upward mobility and security. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2633.36s)]
*  That's all we ever want. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2635.28s)]
*  We want money and to feel secure. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2636.8s)]
*  There's a certain level of security that money gives you. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2639.52s)]
*  There's a certain level of security that being able to have your gun gives you. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2641.52s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2645.2000000000003s)]
*  Money and security. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2646.48s)]
*  Anything that takes away from people's money and security, you're going to lose. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2647.44s)]
*  God damn, that was good. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2651.44s)]
*  That was fucking good. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2652.88s)]
*  It's the truth. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2654.4s)]
*  I was actually thinking other good things he did, the breaking up non-compete clauses, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  which have been an unfair thing for workers. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2659.68s)]
*  That's money though. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  That's another thing they could push that Biden did. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2662.2400000000002s)]
*  He's trying to break up monopolies like TicketmasterLiveNation right now. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2663.76s)]
*  They're trying to go after. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2666.8s)]
*  I don't know how I feel about that though. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2667.52s)]
*  Okay, explain because I don't know much. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2669.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know much either, but just looking the way they even when they try to, even when they go after like the [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2671.28s)]
*  the social media platforms and stuff like that. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2676.0800000000004s)]
*  It's like America has been a country that has pushed free enterprise forever, right? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2679.1200000000003s)]
*  You've pushed capitalism forever. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2683.36s)]
*  So when you got all of these people who took advantage of free market enterprise to build these entities, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2685.92s)]
*  now that they're too big and too powerful and making too much money, you want to break them up? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2691.92s)]
*  There's a point at which they can kill the competition because they're just so big. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2696.4s)]
*  Big bank take little bank. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2698.96s)]
*  That kills capitalism. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2700.32s)]
*  That kills entrepreneurship. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2701.28s)]
*  That kills competition. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2702.32s)]
*  No, just don't get into the ticket business. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2703.28s)]
*  Don't come over here. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2705.6s)]
*  Live Nation and TicketmasterLiveNation. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2706.7999999999997s)]
*  But then if there's enough of those, we're going to do. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2708.0s)]
*  The argument is that it kills free enterprise and then when there is a monopoly, it really punishes the consumer. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2710.16s)]
*  So when there's only one place where you can buy tickets, they can start putting all these hidden fees and extra fees. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2717.04s)]
*  And now the person buying the tickets is fucked. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2722.0s)]
*  Whereas if you have three or four ticketing companies, now those fees got to stay low, which benefits the consumer. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2724.08s)]
*  And it actually benefits theoretically the artist too because we want our consumers. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  I see it sometimes and listen, I'm with Live Nation, right? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2734.0s)]
*  Which is owned by Ticketmaster. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2737.12s)]
*  Like the tour, some of our dates are promoted by Live Nation. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2738.4s)]
*  But I see some of these fees and I'm like, hold the fuck on. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2741.36s)]
*  Like $30 fee on top of a ticket? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2743.68s)]
*  Like one, I'd rather the people buying get to keep that money. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2746.96s)]
*  And they own the venue so he has no option on where to perform. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2752.24s)]
*  They control every aspect of it. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2754.96s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2756.08s)]
*  But because there are plenty of venues that you could perform, but there are ones that might be owned by Live Nation. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2756.64s)]
*  They also promote gigs at ones that aren't owned by Live Nation. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2762.4s)]
*  Kanye would like to know. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2764.96s)]
*  He'd like for you to make a list so he can find all the other videos. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2765.84s)]
*  He can't get into the shows? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2769.28s)]
*  He can't get into the Live Nation ones. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2770.56s)]
*  What's up? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2771.52s)]
*  You think it's over for Kanye? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2771.84s)]

*  You in the United States of America, okay? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2781.12s)]
*  Life can be crazy sometimes and one person's negligence can result in another's settlement. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2783.84s)]
*  Yours that is. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2789.44s)]

*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second because I need to tell you about fume. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2863.44s)]
*  You know fume. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2866.0s)]
*  I've talked about once a month on this podcast. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2866.56s)]
*  If you're just tuning in for the first time right here, this thing right here, this is the good habit that might save your life. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2868.8s)]
*  Okay, I don't want to exaggerate, but it might save your life. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2873.92s)]
*  Now, I'm sure you've heard that the flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading alternative to vaping and smoking. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2876.48s)]
*  It's a whole new movement towards better habits led by the sponsor of today's video, fume. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2883.68s)]
*  Fume. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2888.8s)]
*  This is the better habit that you are going to pick up. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2889.28s)]
*  Fume is an award winning flavored air device. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2891.84s)]
*  Flavored air isn't like vaping. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2893.84s)]
*  Okay, if vapor was sugar filled soda, fume cores would be closer to herbal teas. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2895.36s)]
*  They have lots of delicious flavors to choose from like crisp mint, orange, vanilla. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2900.96s)]
*  With flavored air, you can satisfy your oral fixation right here through a passive diffusion system that utilizes no electronics, no vapor, no combustion. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2905.52s)]
*  Fume is not a vape. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2913.84s)]
*  There is no vapor. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2914.96s)]
*  Okay, you can use it anywhere. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2916.0s)]
*  You want to use it on a plane, use it on a plane. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2918.16s)]
*  You want to use it during a pod, you do it during a pod. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2920.08s)]
*  You want to use it at work, you use it at work. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2922.08s)]
*  And most importantly, there is no nicotine and it is not addictive. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2923.52s)]
*  It also looks awesome. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2927.28s)]
*  Okay, feel the weight right here. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2928.8s)]
*  They got this nice little fidgety thing. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2930.56s)]
*  It's going to calm that anxiety. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2932.32s)]

*  Personally, I like the mint. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2939.9199999999996s)]
*  That's the one that I go with. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2941.4399999999996s)]

*  You think it's over for Kanye? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2962.7999999999997s)]
*  Over in what sense? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2964.64s)]
*  Just like it seems the interest has started to wane. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2965.7599999999998s)]
*  Like that... [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2969.36s)]
*  Yeah, he inserted himself in the beef and no one cares. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2970.16s)]
*  Well, that's because nobody cares about Kanye rapping. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2972.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2976.72s)]
*  Ooh, go on. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2977.2799999999997s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2977.92s)]
*  So if Kanye would have done this 10 years ago, that's like, oh shit, Kanye inserted himself in the beef. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2978.96s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck about Kanye rapping in 2024. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like walking around with your girl with the huge tits. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  Especially when the guys that are rapping are the rappers that we actually want to hear from. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2989.92s)]
*  Pretend to be a Christian while you promote a porn website. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2995.04s)]
*  The idea that he's masquerading as this Christian with a fake wife, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=2998.64s)]
*  you're not even really married to her. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3003.12s)]
*  You're starting a porn company. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3004.56s)]
*  Where is this? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3005.92s)]
*  They're not really married. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3006.88s)]
*  Not in the eyes of God. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3008.48s)]
*  And also starting a porn company. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3012.56s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3016.16s)]
*  Where is this Christianity? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3017.12s)]
*  Everybody jumps to Christianity or jumps to religion when they need a fucking boost. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3018.24s)]
*  You saw even Diddy when he came out in the apology. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3021.68s)]
*  The first thing, I had to turn to God. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3023.52s)]
*  I had to forgive. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3025.6s)]
*  Where was God when you was beating that girl up? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3026.4799999999996s)]
*  I think the problem with humans is that- [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3028.3999999999996s)]
*  And butt fucking guys a lot. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3029.9199999999996s)]

*  What the fuck was we talking about? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3056.7999999999997s)]
*  People using God. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3058.72s)]
*  People using God when they get in trouble. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3059.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3061.36s)]
*  I think that the problem with people like- [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3061.68s)]
*  That's not even a problem. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3064.32s)]
*  Kanye is one of those people when he's in, he's all in. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  Which is what makes him great. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3068.16s)]
*  Because when he focuses on one thing, he's going to focus on that one thing. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3069.92s)]
*  And that's how you get a My Beautiful Dog Twisted fantasy. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3074.16s)]
*  That's how you get a college dropout. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3077.04s)]
*  That's how you get a late registration. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3078.7999999999997s)]
*  That's how you get these amazing sneakers. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3080.08s)]
*  Whatever it is when he focuses on that one thing. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3082.0s)]
*  So it's like, if for that moment he's in the God, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3085.04s)]
*  he's going to be the biggest Christian in the world. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3088.64s)]
*  If he's in the anti-Semitism, he's going to be the biggest anti-Semite that ever existed. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3091.8399999999997s)]

*  That's wild. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3131.6s)]
*  But he's the type of person that whatever he's on, he's on. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3132.32s)]
*  And I mean, it's a gift and a curse for somebody like him. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3136.0800000000004s)]
*  It's the same reason we got all those amazing things that I mentioned. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3140.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3143.44s)]

*  When people need forgiveness, when they need the public to change their tune, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
*  lean into their relationship with God? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3154.56s)]

*  You think it's real, you don't think it's manipulative? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3160.48s)]
*  No, I do think it's real. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3161.84s)]
*  I think you get to those... [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3163.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3164.08s)]
*  No, no, no, I do. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3164.58s)]

*  Then how do you explain God and porn website? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3165.84s)]
*  Being a complex person. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3169.44s)]

*  Do you think it's manipulative or... [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3176.0s)]
*  No, I don't think it's manipulative because I think in those moments [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3177.84s)]
*  they really do be needing God. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3179.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3181.6000000000004s)]
*  I really feel that way. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3182.1600000000003s)]
*  I really feel like you get to a point where you might hit a wall [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3183.04s)]
*  or you might hit rock bottom or you feel like the walls are tumbling down, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3185.92s)]
*  the sky is falling. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3190.72s)]
*  All you have left is to turn to your creator. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3192.0s)]
*  At some point you're going to get down on your knees. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3196.56s)]
*  I'm so... [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3198.24s)]
*  And I ain't talking about being signed a bad boy. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3198.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm talking about at some point, at some fucking point [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3200.3199999999997s)]
*  you're going to have to bow down to your creator. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3203.4399999999996s)]
*  100%. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3205.2799999999997s)]
*  I know people that were atheists who totally believe in God now [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3206.24s)]
*  because of things that have happened in their life. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3210.72s)]
*  And it's not always bad things. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3213.9199999999996s)]
*  Here's the thing, I've no... [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3215.6s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3217.12s)]
*  Wow, you offered really great perspective on that for me [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3218.1600000000003s)]
*  because I'm skeptical a lot. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3220.64s)]
*  So when I see people going through tough times [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3222.08s)]
*  and then they're publicly displaying this love for God, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3224.2400000000002s)]
*  I look at it like, oh, are they just trying to manipulate the most forgiving people? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3227.84s)]
*  Because religious people are incredibly forgiving [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3231.52s)]
*  because a lot of them have went through incredible difficult things [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3233.84s)]
*  and then found God through that difficulty [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3237.04s)]
*  and then they've seen the light through it. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3239.28s)]
*  So I have the most... [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3240.8s)]
*  I'm almost protective of them because I go, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3242.4s)]
*  you might be vulnerable to this piece of shit [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3245.52s)]
*  trying to take advantage of you. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3248.64s)]
*  But that is interesting. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3250.3999999999996s)]
*  When you are at the lowest point in your life, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3252.16s)]
*  every single time you are humbled, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3254.08s)]
*  you might also seek that same salvation. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3255.6s)]
*  Why do you think people find God in jail? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3258.48s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3260.24s)]
*  Can I offer one counterpoint? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3261.12s)]
*  Also, the food is better if you're Muslim in jail. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3262.64s)]
*  Is it? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3265.04s)]
*  Yeah, because you have to be halal. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3265.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3268.3999999999996s)]
*  So I think a lot of people convert to Islam for the food. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3268.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3271.04s)]
*  They still don't convert to Judaism. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3271.52s)]
*  Well, they don't let it happen. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3273.68s)]
*  Also, the Jewish food is... [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3276.72s)]
*  That's true. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3278.08s)]
*  Actual question. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3278.7999999999997s)]
*  There's a Bible verse that hit me really hard at the time. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3281.4399999999996s)]
*  I remember it's Super World, Matthew 6. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3283.7599999999998s)]
*  Essentially, your good deeds, your relationship with God [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3285.2s)]
*  is not real if you are out there displaying it publicly. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3288.48s)]
*  So I'm inclined to believe, Andrew, especially with Christians, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3291.9199999999996s)]
*  when they suddenly find God very publicly [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3295.2s)]
*  because there is an actual Bible verse that says [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3297.9199999999996s)]
*  that's not going to get rewarded by God. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3301.04s)]
*  The guy who doesn't let his left hand know what his right hand [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3303.2s)]
*  is doing when he's doing good deeds or whatever, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3305.12s)]
*  that is the guy that gets rewarded. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3307.04s)]
*  But then they also tell us that we should champion God. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3308.2400000000002s)]
*  We should publicly praise him. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3312.0s)]
*  We should glorify him. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3315.04s)]
*  I can't remember the exact word. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3316.0s)]
*  Testify, testimony. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3316.96s)]
*  We all should have a testimony with God, too, though. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3318.64s)]
*  And just like Sharla was saying, when Kanye goes in, he goes all in. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3320.88s)]
*  He made an album, No Cursing. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3324.48s)]
*  He was doing Sunday service every single Sunday and not charging for it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3326.32s)]
*  So it's like he was really all in during that period of time. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3330.16s)]
*  And I think we forget one of Kanye's first singles. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3333.3599999999997s)]
*  That was massive with Jesus Walk. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3336.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3337.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's not like he always hadn't had a relationship with God. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3338.16s)]
*  No, that's true. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3344.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3345.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3347.3599999999997s)]
*  Maybe I have to have more of an open mind with those. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3348.0s)]
*  I get why you say that. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  I just feel bad because I know that there are people who have been saved [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3355.04s)]
*  and they see the power of God. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3358.48s)]
*  So when other people also see the power of God, they go, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3360.72s)]
*  oh, I remember being in that situation. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3363.36s)]
*  And that sometimes is manipulative because I know like what I saw from Diddy was to me was 100% [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3365.44s)]
*  manipulative. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3371.44s)]
*  Diddy's always been a person that's talked about God. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3372.56s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3374.72s)]
*  It don't matter how much you talk about God. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3375.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3377.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3377.44s)]
*  Be about it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3378.0s)]
*  Your actions. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3378.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3379.2s)]
*  I was one of my affirmations today when I was reading was talking about effective truth. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3379.84s)]
*  And effective truth is essentially like, you know, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3384.56s)]
*  we say things, right? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3387.92s)]
*  But it's about what you actually do that truth that honestly matters. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3389.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm probably fucking it all up because I just read it this morning. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3394.8s)]
*  But it's basically like what you actually do is what ultimately matters. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3396.8s)]
*  You can say anything, but if your actions ain't matching your words, it's like, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3401.6800000000003s)]
*  what's the point? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3406.6400000000003s)]
*  And what's so scary about a lot of those people like that? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3407.36s)]
*  Okay, you fuck up. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3410.0s)]
*  You turn to God. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3411.76s)]
*  What happens when things get good again? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3413.0400000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3415.1200000000003s)]
*  When things get good again, you just all of a sudden forget about God. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3415.68s)]
*  That's when God really going to bring you to your knees. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3418.48s)]
*  Like, oh, word, you forgot just that fast, huh? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3420.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3424.48s)]
*  Because this ain't a lot of these people's first rodeo, bro. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3425.7599999999998s)]
*  A lot of these people have been down these, you know, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3429.04s)]
*  points where it looked like they couldn't come back from it. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3432.24s)]
*  And, you know, God found a way. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3435.8399999999997s)]
*  But if you keep going back to the same behavior that, you know, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3438.08s)]
*  caused you to hit rock bottom in the first place, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3442.24s)]
*  what things going to happen the second time? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3444.8s)]
*  I don't know why we act like God is, you know, just all forgiving. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3446.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3450.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, he kind of said that. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3451.36s)]
*  Well, he also created man in his image according to his likeness. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3452.7200000000003s)]
*  So if I come to your house and pee on the rug once, you might forgive me. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3456.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, okay, he was drinking. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3459.6800000000003s)]
*  I know he was in a retarded class in high school. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3462.32s)]
*  So I mean, like something, right? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3463.84s)]
*  But if I come in and do it again, you're like, all right, bro. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3465.52s)]
*  Number one, I probably shouldn't let you back in my house the second time. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3468.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3471.84s)]
*  But now you really are forbidden from coming here anymore. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3472.4s)]
*  In our purest form, I think we would still love that person. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3475.92s)]
*  And I think that's what God does. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3478.4s)]
*  I think in your purest form, you still look at that person for all their flaws [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3479.76s)]
*  and all the negative things that they're going through and all the pain that, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3483.28s)]
*  and I don't do this. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3485.92s)]
*  I'm not fronting like I do. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3486.7200000000003s)]
*  I hate that motherfucker the first time. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3487.84s)]
*  But God would look at that person and say, I know he's struggling. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3489.44s)]
*  I know he's angry. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3491.92s)]
*  He is not maybe worthy of the rewards that I gave him. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3492.88s)]
*  And maybe I don't give him those, but I still love him the same. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3495.92s)]
*  And he's always welcome in my home. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3498.2400000000002s)]
*  That could be true. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3499.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe he just has a weak bladder and he couldn't hold it. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3500.2400000000002s)]
*  I have a very weak bladder. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3503.04s)]
*  We also act like God hasn't hit reset quite a few times now. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3503.7599999999998s)]
*  He's hit reset on this shit quite a few times. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3508.08s)]
*  Like he asked her. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3510.64s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3511.52s)]
*  And we look at all these planets that ain't got no life on them. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3512.16s)]
*  That might have been a reset too, a permanent one. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3515.68s)]
*  God might just keep giving Earth all of these different chances. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3517.84s)]
*  How we know we're not on our last hurrah? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3520.56s)]
*  So what were the dinosaurs doing? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3522.3199999999997s)]
*  Butt fucking. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3524.64s)]
*  It was gang. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3525.2799999999997s)]
*  It was gang probably, right? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3526.48s)]
*  Yo, that's all it took. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3529.04s)]
*  He said asteroid. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3530.72s)]
*  See, he's like, yes, I'm going to give you tons of that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3532.08s)]
*  Why does the brontosaurus have that long neck? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3535.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3538.72s)]
*  The T-Rex had them little arms right up in your asshole. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3539.4399999999996s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3544.56s)]
*  Hey, tip over. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3545.6s)]
*  T-Rex rocked. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3549.2s)]
*  Never mind. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3549.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, say it though. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3550.64s)]
*  No, I won't. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3551.4399999999996s)]
*  Say it though. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3551.8399999999997s)]
*  Nope. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3552.3199999999997s)]
*  No, because let's get honest here. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3552.64s)]
*  Let's get honest here. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3555.2s)]
*  Let's get honest here. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3556.4799999999996s)]
*  Let's get brutally honest here. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3558.4s)]
*  Say it. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3560.56s)]
*  Say it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3561.2799999999997s)]
*  What about the T-Rex? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3561.6s)]
*  You're going to move that tail out of the way and start digging? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3562.96s)]
*  The leaders seen in Jurassic Park where they were sucking each other's dicks. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3564.7999999999997s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3567.2s)]
*  No, man. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3567.68s)]
*  Just tell us. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3569.8399999999997s)]
*  Talking loud is saying something. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3570.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what you need to do. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3572.4s)]
*  Listen, chapter 17 is talking loud and saying something. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3573.68s)]
*  You would know. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3577.28s)]
*  Andrew, what was your favorite part of the book? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3595.92s)]
*  I read all your books. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3601.1200000000003s)]
*  I do the audio though. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3601.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3602.88s)]
*  Two times the speed. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3603.1200000000003s)]
*  Time for some action. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3604.32s)]
*  Time for some action. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3605.28s)]
*  Spelled the number four. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3606.72s)]
*  Refreshed at me. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3608.88s)]
*  S-U-M-A-C-T-I-N. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3609.6s)]
*  I don't care what word you use to describe your political affiliation, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3611.92s)]
*  what religion you worship or what philosophy you subscribe to, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3615.52s)]

*  Ain't that what he just said? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3623.52s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3624.48s)]
*  That's what I said. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3625.04s)]

*  Consistent. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3625.92s)]
*  You know, I'm out here. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3626.56s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's all about action, bro. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3627.52s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3629.36s)]
*  You can tell me anything. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3630.4s)]
*  Show me. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3632.4s)]
*  And that's the tricky thing with the internet is because it allows you [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3633.44s)]
*  to show things that you're not doing. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3636.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3638.0s)]
*  I saw somebody, I think it was published as Weekly. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3638.64s)]
*  They gave me a great review, but they was like, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3640.88s)]
*  but he has these tired takes about social media and how it's ruining a generation. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3643.28s)]
*  Why is that a tired take? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3647.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fact. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3648.64s)]
*  It's a fucking fact. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3649.36s)]
*  Nobody ever said, nobody ever said, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3650.8s)]
*  it's a tired take that cigarettes are killing people. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3652.7200000000003s)]
*  Or you can never say that enough. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3655.2000000000003s)]
*  Or what if somebody comes out with the global warming shit? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3657.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a tired take. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3660.56s)]
*  Tired take about those. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3661.6800000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3662.4s)]
*  Why is my, why is social, why is social? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3663.28s)]
*  Social media ruining us and ruining our critical thinking. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3665.84s)]
*  It's also funny because social media is killing Reader's Digest. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3668.4s)]
*  You said it's Reader's Digest. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3671.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3672.2400000000002s)]
*  Anybody think about Reader's Digest? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3672.8s)]
*  No, both in Weekly. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3673.76s)]
*  Either way. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3674.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3675.2000000000003s)]
*  Wait, wait, so what was the specific take that they took exception to? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3676.0s)]
*  About social media. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3681.2000000000003s)]
*  They didn't even say, they just said it was a, they just said, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3683.52s)]
*  they basically said it's a great book. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3686.08s)]
*  He has some tired takes about social media [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3687.6000000000004s)]
*  and how social media is ruining us as a society. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3690.48s)]
*  And I'm just like, that's not a tired take. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3693.36s)]
*  Truth. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3696.5600000000004s)]
*  Kyle Newport wrote a whole book called Digital Minimalism, which I love. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3696.96s)]
*  Everybody knows. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3700.7200000000003s)]
*  Jonathan Haidt has a book out now. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3700.88s)]
*  It's the Anxious Generation. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3703.0400000000004s)]
*  I haven't got, I'm still reading Bill Ma's book, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3703.92s)]
*  so I haven't got the Anxious Generation. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3705.36s)]
*  But that's, that's. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3706.32s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3707.6000000000004s)]
*  So how is that a tired take? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3708.4s)]
*  How is warning somebody about something that's ruining us? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3710.2400000000002s)]
*  All right, what about the practical application? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3713.2000000000003s)]
*  That's something I saw in Haidt's that I thought was really good about. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3715.0400000000004s)]
*  Like restricting, it's not only just restricting phones, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3718.0s)]
*  because there's a certain point in your child's life [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3720.8s)]
*  where in order for them to be like a social individual, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3722.6400000000003s)]
*  you need them to have a phone. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3725.28s)]
*  Like you don't want them to be that weird kid [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3727.1200000000003s)]
*  that has no way of getting in contact with their friends. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3729.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's important that they text each other or whatever. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3731.6000000000004s)]
*  And like, you know, they gossip with each other. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3734.1600000000003s)]
*  Do whatever kids fucking do. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3735.6800000000003s)]
*  But there are certain ages where you can do it. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3737.0400000000004s)]
*  And he was basically like, avoid puberty. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3739.2000000000003s)]
*  That's the most vulnerable time. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3741.6800000000003s)]
*  They have all these emotions going through their body. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3743.36s)]
*  They're so easily manipulated. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3745.52s)]
*  And the internet is right there to take advantage of them. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3747.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3749.28s)]
*  You have daughters, so I'm wondering like. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3751.0400000000004s)]
*  I don't have none of my kids on social media. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3752.2400000000002s)]
*  How old are they? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3753.6000000000004s)]
*  As far as I know, my oldest is 15. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3754.08s)]
*  And she doesn't have any social. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3755.44s)]
*  As far as I know. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3756.96s)]
*  She might have some accounts on the computer. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3758.96s)]
*  I did find one back in the day, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3762.56s)]
*  but it was just like quick, fast, and a hurry. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3763.84s)]
*  Like if you do this, you won't be doing this. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  Like it's just that simple. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3769.12s)]
*  Because, you know, I just feel like social media [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3770.16s)]
*  really is that dangerous to your point, to a young mind. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3771.92s)]
*  Like I think the reason some of us are able to navigate it [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3775.04s)]
*  a little bit better, because we're older. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3777.68s)]
*  We lived in a world without it. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3779.6s)]
*  Can you imagine growing up in a society [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3781.36s)]
*  where this is all you fucking know and social god damn. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3783.36s)]
*  We watched the same 10 music videos after school [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3785.92s)]
*  every single day. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3789.36s)]
*  And discussed them all. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3790.2400000000002s)]
*  Could break them down so fucking eloquently. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3791.6s)]
*  Think about how little information we consumed as kids. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3793.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3796.88s)]
*  Like the same 10 videos. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3797.44s)]
*  It was like the same 10 books. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3800.1600000000003s)]
*  But it was almost nothing that we were consuming [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3802.88s)]
*  on a daily basis. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3805.1200000000003s)]
*  I wonder if that like affects memory and stuff now. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3806.7200000000003s)]
*  I feel like that a little bit where we're like, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3809.44s)]
*  it takes me a few times to really kind of get some to lock in. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3812.48s)]
*  And obviously I'm terrified of that [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3815.36s)]
*  because my dad's dementia or whatever. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3816.48s)]
*  But I wonder if it's, my brain is filled with so much [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3817.92s)]
*  absolute bullshit that I don't have a calm enough [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3821.1200000000003s)]
*  and receptive enough brain to consuming things [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3825.36s)]
*  I actually want to remember. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3827.92s)]
*  I have a bit about this. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3828.96s)]
*  I just instead I say it's my wife's stories [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3829.92s)]
*  that are taking up the whole fucking words. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3831.52s)]
*  That's why I stopped taking in so much information. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3834.1600000000003s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy to say. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3836.0s)]
*  But it's just like you just cannot physically [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3837.92s)]
*  or mentally or emotionally consume everything [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3841.44s)]
*  that comes at you on a daily fucking basis. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3845.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't even read as many books as I used to [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3848.08s)]
*  because I find myself just reading it [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3849.76s)]
*  and then forgetting about it. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3851.76s)]
*  Yes, and I'm like damn I don't even remember [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3853.1200000000003s)]
*  nothing that was in that book. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3854.48s)]
*  So I'd rather read two or three books a year. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3855.44s)]
*  The amount of times I have to reread a page [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3858.48s)]
*  because I get to the bottom like I don't. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3860.32s)]
*  The fuck did I just read? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3862.4s)]
*  I don't think I read a single word of it. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3863.2000000000003s)]
*  I was telling Mark about a TV show. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3864.4s)]
*  We were flying back from I think it was Abu Dhabi. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3866.32s)]
*  I was telling Mark and Derek about a TV show [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3868.2400000000002s)]
*  and I was like oh my god the fucking show is incredible. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3870.1600000000003s)]
*  The ending was amazing. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3872.32s)]
*  And then in that moment I go I don't even know who killed him. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3873.92s)]
*  A show I watched that I am projecting my opinions [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3878.0s)]
*  on someone saying the end is so incredible [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3881.36s)]
*  that I forgot the fucking ending. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3883.2000000000003s)]
*  Bro, I do that. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3885.44s)]
*  How? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3886.4s)]
*  I talk to people. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3887.1200000000003s)]
*  I have conversations with people [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3888.4s)]
*  and I'll be like hell man damn I can't remember [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3889.76s)]
*  what I heard such and such told me such and such. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3892.32s)]
*  And the person will be like I told you. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3894.0s)]
*  I told you that. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3895.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3896.32s)]
*  I told you to have fucking yesterday. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3897.68s)]
*  So this is in Jonathan Hyde's book. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3898.88s)]
*  He brings up Harrison Bergeron this book by Kurt Vonnegut [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3900.56s)]
*  where basically the whole world everyone has to be equal. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3902.88s)]
*  It's like 2080 some people have high IQ [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3905.12s)]
*  some people have low IQ [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3907.04s)]
*  so in order to balance everything out [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3907.92s)]
*  the people with high IQs have a device placed in their brains [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3909.2s)]
*  that every two or three minutes there's a beep that goes off [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3911.52s)]
*  and it makes them lose their train of thought. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3913.6s)]
*  So they can't sit there and think of all these advanced things [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3915.04s)]
*  and you know propel themselves. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3917.52s)]
*  Essentially dumbs them down. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3918.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3920.0s)]
*  But this is interesting. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3920.56s)]
*  Jonathan Hyde makes the correlation that [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3921.36s)]
*  we basically already have that. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3923.12s)]
*  So we're sitting here and every two or three minutes [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3924.88s)]
*  you're thinking of something you're like oh that's a really funny connection. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3926.48s)]
*  That's something that can go in my book. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3928.6400000000003s)]
*  That's something I can talk about on idiots. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3929.6800000000003s)]
*  And then all of a sudden your phone goes off and you go. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3931.04s)]
*  Bro that's me. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3932.96s)]
*  And then you're immediately disrupted. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3933.6s)]
*  And so we're already disrupting ourselves and dumbing ourselves down [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3934.96s)]
*  and he says we're not taking time to basically be with ourselves. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3937.52s)]
*  How much smarter are you in the shower? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3940.96s)]
*  Oh I remember everything is more creative for you. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  And then as soon as you get out I forgot like what the fuck did I just I just had a [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3946.48s)]
*  faya idea what the fuck happened to it. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3949.28s)]
*  You know or just in the middle of conversation [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3951.44s)]
*  you'd be talking you'd be talking you'd be talking and then it'd be like one thing. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3953.92s)]
*  I'd be like god damn. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3957.2000000000003s)]
*  When you're about to go to sleep. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3958.56s)]
*  I'm sitting there listening to Mark I'm like how the fuck did Mark remember all [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3959.2000000000003s)]
*  that shit from that book literally. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3961.76s)]
*  And as he's talking I had to refocus myself to listen to what he's saying [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3963.84s)]
*  because he's telling me exactly what just caused me to lose focus on what he was saying. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3968.96s)]
*  Yeah yeah I just googled it I don't even remember it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3973.12s)]
*  What did I say? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3975.28s)]
*  No but it is I do remember what you said but I don't remember what you did. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3977.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm curious what happens to kids in like say 10 years from now [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3980.48s)]
*  when they have all this distraction while they're also consuming. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3984.4s)]
*  We didn't really have that much distraction while we're consuming [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3988.32s)]
*  and we weren't even consuming that much shit in school anyway. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3990.7200000000003s)]
*  Like they were telling us to read we weren't reading books over the fucking summer. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3992.96s)]
*  Maybe you were I don't know. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3995.76s)]
*  Book your program baby four books for a pizza. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=3998.4s)]
*  I bought the pizza. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4002.0s)]
*  Were they coloring? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4005.28s)]
*  That's why I started reading so much Judy Blum and shit. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4007.44s)]
*  Judy Blum Beverly Klee. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4009.84s)]
*  Yeah so but what I'm trying to say is like what happens 10 years from now right? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4011.36s)]
*  Like these kids right now let's assume let's go off the same thesis right? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4014.48s)]
*  That they're not able to hold on to the information that they're consuming [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4017.6800000000003s)]
*  because they have this other stuff distracting them. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4023.52s)]
*  They have that little tick that will beep. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4025.84s)]
*  They never learn shit. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4027.84s)]
*  Well 10 years will they not have no fucking algebra? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4029.04s)]
*  Will they not know geography? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4030.96s)]
*  Will they not know all the things? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4032.0s)]
*  And we've outsourced most of the learning. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4032.7200000000003s)]
*  We're gonna outsource even more and more and more to AI. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4034.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's like there's not even a need for me to learn. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4036.6400000000003s)]
*  I think eventually they're gonna bake in like a dark period throughout the day. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4038.4s)]
*  Like you know how Spain has siestas? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4041.84s)]
*  I think there'll be a dark period. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4044.32s)]
*  America would never do that. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4045.6s)]
*  Nah I think they will. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4046.7200000000003s)]
*  Explain what would it look like? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4048.08s)]
*  So like say a certain period during school where no technology no screens no nothing. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4049.6s)]
*  Just let your brain just calm down. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4054.88s)]
*  And I think adults will do it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4057.28s)]
*  I think everybody will do it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4058.4s)]
*  It'll just be like something that's known that we need this just to continue our mental health. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4059.36s)]
*  American culture would have to change so much. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4063.36s)]
*  Yeah this could be propaganda but a teacher came forward recently [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4065.12s)]
*  with an article and he was like I used to love teaching and I had to quit [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4067.92s)]
*  because I just can't compete with phones. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4070.08s)]
*  We try to take the phones from the kids. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4071.52s)]
*  There's like we cannot beat the phones. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4073.2000000000003s)]
*  They do not listen. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4075.12s)]
*  So they try to make a dark period from 8 a.m to 3 p.m. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't fucking work. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4080.64s)]
*  These are kids they're not having it. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4081.6800000000003s)]
*  We're a society in America that loves over consumption number one [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4083.52s)]
*  and a lot of those teachers are probably like you know what? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4087.44s)]
*  Get back on your phone kids because y'all stressing me the fuck out. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4090.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4093.12s)]
*  Because you're forced to entertain them. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4093.84s)]
*  That's another thing I talk about in the book too. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4096.4s)]
*  It's like when I say give yourself permission to not have these conversations. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4098.08s)]
*  It's okay if you want to not talk to the person next to you [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4102.16s)]
*  and you just want to be in your phone or you want to read your book [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4105.12s)]
*  or you want to be alone with your thoughts. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4107.28s)]
*  Don't feel like we have to make conversation just because we're sitting next to each other. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4108.72s)]
*  Like that's something that I think you know even with that dark period you're talking about Alex. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4112.8s)]
*  It's like you can't force these kids to not want to be on what they want to be on. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4117.36s)]
*  I just feel that eventually it'll get to the point where [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4123.2s)]
*  the global warming will actually start warming too much. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4125.76s)]
*  Where it's like we really need to do some shit about it and I think [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4128.400000000001s)]
*  Oh okay. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4131.52s)]
*  Yeah I think like maybe suicides might go up or [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4132.240000000001s)]
*  certain things just start going up to a level where it's like no one feels comfortable. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4135.52s)]
*  Nah you gotta bring back hell. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4139.120000000001s)]
*  You gotta bring back the story of hell. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4140.8s)]
*  That is the perfect time to bring back the story of hell. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4144.56s)]
*  So there's no fear of going to hell anymore. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  No there's hell of fear going to hell [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4148.8s)]
*  because if you think it's hot now with climate change [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4151.360000000001s)]
*  don't act right here on this motherfucking planet and feel how it's going to be in the afterlife. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4154.64s)]
*  If you can't stand this shit you don't want to go to eternal hell fire. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4159.92s)]
*  Bring back stories of hell. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4164.24s)]
*  When the last time you heard a good story of hell bro? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4166.56s)]
*  Never. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4168.8s)]
*  For a while. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4169.360000000001s)]
*  I think we just lived in New York for a while. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4170.0s)]
*  I mean if you go back for a while there'll be a lot of stories of hell. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4172.96s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4175.360000000001s)]
*  Because the funny part is in most movies New York is hell. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4177.04s)]
*  Like when you say show you hell they show you like. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4180.32s)]
*  Relax. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4182.56s)]
*  No they do. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4183.12s)]
*  They show you like New York fucking city. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4183.68s)]
*  Do they? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4186.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4187.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4188.48s)]
*  You didn't know that? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4189.12s)]
*  I mean I remember watching The Devil's Advocate or whatever that was. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4189.92s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4192.88s)]
*  Great movie. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4193.92s)]
*  Great movie. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4194.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4194.88s)]
*  Devil Wears Prada another one. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4195.38s)]
*  Devil Wears Prada awesome. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4196.72s)]
*  Country Boy. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4197.92s)]
*  Think about it though. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4198.72s)]
*  Keanu Reeves is a country boy. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4200.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4201.599999999999s)]
*  Came to New York. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4202.24s)]
*  New York was the devil's playground. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4203.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4204.8s)]

*  Chill it out. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4214.28s)]
*  I would say that if I moved to New York and didn't make it either. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4214.8s)]
*  Well it's probably because it's hell over there and you gotta be the devil in order to make it. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4219.36s)]
*  Bring back hell baby. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  Bring back stories of hell. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4223.76s)]
*  I wonder if we do start to get a little bit more religious. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4225.36s)]
*  And I wonder if that's what can kind of rein us in. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4227.92s)]
*  Because that seems like there are very few things everybody can agree on. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4229.599999999999s)]
*  Like what is like the one thing that Americans can agree on right now? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4233.04s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4270.42s)]

*  It makes you start thinking about you know what it is you should be doing in your fucking life. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4272.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4278.66s)]
*  What do you think that tragedy might look like if it's coming? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4279.62s)]
*  Nuclear weapon. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4281.94s)]

*  Why why why do you say that? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4288.42s)]
*  I just talked to a woman on like the denuclearization board. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4289.7s)]
*  She's trying to like get all these countries to stop making nuclear weapons. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4292.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4294.98s)]
*  And I didn't realize how real the shit is. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4295.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4297.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4298.98s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4299.54s)]
*  You didn't realize. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4299.94s)]
*  Like I wasn't alive during the Cold War. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4300.5s)]
*  I wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4301.78s)]
*  I wasn't alive during any of these like major nuclear standoffs. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4303.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4305.86s)]
*  So in my mind it's like yeah some bombs. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  And it's just based on somebody's stability as a human. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4307.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4311.219999999999s)]
*  Putin has a sole power to launch any amount of nuclear warheads. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4311.54s)]
*  I think they have a thousand fifteen hundred. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4315.54s)]
*  And if you're like you know literally destroy the world. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4317.7s)]
*  There's been rumors that he's sick and stuff like that. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4320.42s)]
*  So if you're at that point. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4322.82s)]
*  We just keep saying that shit. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4323.38s)]
*  I don't know if we here's or not but if you get to a point where you like [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4324.74s)]
*  you know what man fucking I'm about to be out anyway. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4327.54s)]
*  Push the goddamn button. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4329.7s)]
*  You just don't know what you don't know. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4331.14s)]
*  Like that shit could really. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4333.22s)]
*  If he gets dementia or he starts losing his mind [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4335.38s)]
*  who's going to be able to overthrow him in time theoretically. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4337.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4340.58s)]
*  Not that it will happen but theoretically he can just press that button. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4340.9s)]
*  That's a situation on purpose it could even just happen on accident. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4343.46s)]
*  There's like all these stories of like Russian you know sub sub [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4345.78s)]
*  it's like submarine dudes chilling with a nuclear warhead on the submarine. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4348.9s)]
*  And then all of a sudden three of the guys have to all push the button to shoot the nuke. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4352.18s)]
*  And they get a read on the radar like oh Russia's just been attacked by American missiles. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4356.0199999999995s)]
*  We got to shoot the nuke back. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4360.099999999999s)]
*  I'll explain that again. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4361.139999999999s)]
*  This is a crazy story. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4362.099999999999s)]
*  This is an insane story. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4363.139999999999s)]
*  This happened in like the 60s 70s. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4363.94s)]
*  This is like absolutely insane. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4366.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm going to kind of paraphrase. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4368.0199999999995s)]
*  Basically you have three Russian guys on a nuclear submarine. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4369.219999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4371.78s)]
*  On the submarine they have a nuclear warhead. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4372.259999999999s)]
*  It's not a joke. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4373.54s)]
*  There's a real this is not no one's gonna be gay. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4374.339999999999s)]
*  No one's gonna be gay. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4377.0599999999995s)]
*  There's nothing crazy. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4377.94s)]
*  Three Russian guys are on a sub. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4378.66s)]
*  Russian soldiers on a sub. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4380.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a nuclear warhead on the sub that can launch the nuke from the sub. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4381.299999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4384.179999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4384.66s)]
*  And then they all of a sudden get a read on the radar that Russia's being attacked by [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4385.54s)]
*  an American nuclear bomb. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4389.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4391.219999999999s)]
*  And the status quo is if you are attacked. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4391.86s)]
*  We get attacked we have to immediately counter strike. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4394.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4396.74s)]
*  So two of the guys on the on the sub go all right we're getting the reading we're going [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4397.139999999999s)]
*  to counter strike. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4400.0199999999995s)]
*  And the third guy goes I'm not doing it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4400.66s)]
*  And he goes why? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4402.339999999999s)]
*  And he's like we just have to wait. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4402.98s)]
*  Let's just wait 30 minutes an hour. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4404.259999999999s)]
*  Let's see if it hits and then we'll counter strike. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4405.94s)]
*  So they wait 30 minutes. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4408.0199999999995s)]
*  They phone up and all of a sudden they realize that the reading they had on the radar was [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4409.0599999999995s)]
*  a faulty reading. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4411.78s)]
*  There was no actual nuclear missile or any missile that was fired. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4412.5s)]
*  That guy saved humanity. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4415.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4416.26s)]

*  Just get them the fuck out of here. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4771.94s)]
*  Which makes me feel like they can trust him. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4773.3s)]
*  It makes me feel like he's a he's a good bad guy. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4776.82s)]
*  Hey we need somebody out there this is gonna pop shit. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4781.46s)]
*  You need a foil. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4783.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4784.82s)]
*  You need somebody to keep everybody on their toes. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4785.0599999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4786.66s)]
*  To make you think some bad shit can happen. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4786.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4788.259999999999s)]
*  But we really got him in check. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4788.66s)]
*  What was the last time we got somebody out of here? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4789.46s)]
*  Because I feel like it's just it's just been a while and it makes me think that's not [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4792.099999999999s)]
*  we don't have it like that anymore. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4795.78s)]
*  What's what's a while? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4797.46s)]
*  Well the uh some people some people feel like that some people feel like the Iran president. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4798.42s)]
*  There's some shaky shit there. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4803.94s)]
*  I thought it was. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4805.38s)]
*  I think that was an inside job. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4805.94s)]
*  Yeah I thought it was the Cowboys and the Starboys apparently. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4807.299999999999s)]
*  I think it's an inside job. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4810.0199999999995s)]
*  What the fuck the weekend got to do with this? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4811.219999999999s)]
*  Cowboys and the Starboys. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4814.5s)]
*  No no the Cowboys are America and the Starboys are the Jews the star the flag you know. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4815.46s)]
*  But uh okay okay but I think it was an inside job specifically because [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4820.0199999999995s)]
*  apparently they took the black box out of the helicopter like two weeks before. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4824.42s)]
*  So why would there not be a black box in the president's helicopter? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4829.38s)]
*  Also I think all the helicopters are super old because. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4833.54s)]
*  They're American and to get the parts. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4836.5s)]
*  There's a boycott on American uh there's a boycott on like uh military [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4837.94s)]
*  equipment being sold to Iran. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4844.5s)]
*  American parts to replace. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4846.66s)]
*  So so I and then the other thing is I think that the supreme leader or whatever his name is. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4848.9s)]
*  Khomeini. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4853.38s)]
*  Khomeini's I think Khomeini wants his son to take over after him. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4854.5s)]
*  But the fact is that the power is not necessarily split but there are people who really love the [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4858.099999999999s)]
*  president apparently from what I was reading in Iran and whenever there is a split of power or [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4862.42s)]
*  people who are following power the way that you consolidate that is you get rid of the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4869.22s)]
*  other person that's got some power. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4873.860000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4875.3s)]
*  So it looks to me that it's more. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4875.7s)]
*  It looks suspicious. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4877.3s)]
*  But then that wasn't us. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4878.18s)]
*  But all we haven't done. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4879.46s)]
*  But we said yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4880.34s)]
*  Dump somebody you said it was an inside job shows. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4881.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know that's what I read. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4884.1s)]
*  But all this shit is inside jobs. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4885.3s)]
*  Keep going keep going. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4887.14s)]
*  That's the whole point you get somebody that people feel comfortable with and close to [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4887.860000000001s)]
*  to infiltrate and go get the job done. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4892.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4894.42s)]
*  I guess there's no foreigner shooting American presidents you know. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4894.58s)]
*  The presidents who have been shot have been shot by people who are here. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4898.34s)]
*  Somebody got in their ear and corrupted them in some way shape or form. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4901.7s)]
*  So who are the leaders that we want switched up? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4904.42s)]
*  Obviously Putin. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4906.5s)]
*  But then here's the other thing about Putin. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4907.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4909.38s)]
*  Who do we want to die? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4910.98s)]
*  Switched out. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4913.62s)]
*  Yell yell yell. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4914.26s)]
*  So here's the difference. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4914.98s)]
*  Give an asylum in America put them in the Hamptons. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4915.78s)]
*  No no no here's not the Hamptons. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4917.86s)]
*  Here's the thing about Putin I don't even know if we want Putin switched out. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4920.26s)]
*  Because if the military industrial complex in America makes tons of money making weapons [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4923.860000000001s)]
*  right we need someone to use those weapons on. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4929.62s)]
*  Putin is nice. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4933.780000000001s)]
*  He's a nice foil. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4935.9400000000005s)]
*  He's someone who's going to start a war. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4936.9800000000005s)]
*  Or he's going to at least respond to our antagonization right. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4939.7s)]
*  So you need someone who responds. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4943.860000000001s)]
*  You don't need someone who bends over. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4945.62s)]
*  If they bend over we can't use the weapons. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4946.9800000000005s)]
*  I never thought about that until you said it. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4948.66s)]
*  But a guy that's saying I'll send over the nukes if I need to. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4949.9400000000005s)]
*  That guy you don't want to fuck with. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4953.139999999999s)]
*  That guy you can switch out. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4954.34s)]
*  Logically if you believe that he'll do it. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4955.219999999999s)]
*  Maybe he'll just talk. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4957.62s)]
*  Exactly I don't think we believe he'll do it. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4958.66s)]
*  Think about what we're doing. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4960.42s)]
*  We are supplying Ukraine with all the weapons. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4961.219999999999s)]
*  We're essentially the ones that are I mean it's American weapons that are killing. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4963.7s)]
*  Now that could give him incentive to want to. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4968.98s)]
*  Of course but the fact that he doesn't still. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4971.38s)]
*  And he knows where the weapons are coming from. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4973.38s)]
*  He knows where the weapons are coming from. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4974.98s)]
*  So maybe it's the perfect foil. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4976.66s)]
*  Maybe he also has a military industrial complex that he needs to supply [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4978.74s)]
*  use weapons for. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4983.06s)]
*  So he's liking the fact that this war is going on too. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4984.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4986.5s)]
*  The thing about sending nukes is once he sends over nukes we send over nukes. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4986.9800000000005s)]
*  But we're not talking about nukes. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4989.860000000001s)]
*  We're talking about what is the status quo. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4990.9800000000005s)]
*  So far we're the only ones that have sent nukes. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4993.3s)]
*  And we've been in so many skirmishes, wars, conflicts, whatever you call with. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4994.9800000000005s)]
*  With the Russians. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4998.900000000001s)]
*  We're talking about back to Afghanistan right? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=4999.54s)]
*  Where nothing has happened. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5001.78s)]
*  And we know that this is Russian weapons and American weapons combating. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5003.06s)]
*  We're using proxies. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5006.34s)]

*  You could make the argument. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5359.7s)]
*  It's worse. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5361.3s)]
*  Then it might. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5361.78s)]
*  Okay, why do you think it's worse? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5362.26s)]
*  Because I respect you more if you're getting a big ass check from a pharmaceutical company. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5363.62s)]
*  And if you get YouTube access. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5367.78s)]

*  It's my fucking debt right now. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5373.14s)]

*  I got a billion to get fucked in the ass. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5456.900000000001s)]
*  Let's negotiate. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5458.900000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5459.700000000001s)]
*  That's all. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5460.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5460.820000000001s)]
*  You're a dirty ass. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5461.14s)]
*  Your ass is dirty. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5462.34s)]
*  It's gonna be way less. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5464.42s)]
*  So that is that is but that is the thing that I've noticed. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5465.700000000001s)]
*  So maybe it's just indicative of like who we are as people. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5468.26s)]
*  We're just gonna lean into where our bread is buttered. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5470.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's gonna be very hard for there to be truth out there. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5473.3s)]
*  It's gonna be very hard because a lot of times people aren't willing to take the hit for the truth. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5476.02s)]
*  Nobody cares about the truth when the lies more entertaining. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5480.5s)]
*  Oh who said that? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5482.58s)]
*  Who said that? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5484.18s)]
*  I said that in my first book. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5484.74s)]
*  Who said that before? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5485.9400000000005s)]
*  Also it's the narrative. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5486.900000000001s)]
*  It's not even when the lies more entertaining. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5489.54s)]
*  It's when the lies more lucrative. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5490.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5492.66s)]
*  Nobody cares about the truth when the lies more lucrative. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5493.06s)]
*  When the lies more lucrative. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5495.14s)]
*  And once you like understand the internet and you realize how easy it is to just get views and that kind of shit. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5496.26s)]
*  And you like like I'm very proud of us. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5502.34s)]
*  Like we make an active choice. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5504.900000000001s)]
*  We're like okay we're gonna have some people on that we think are fun. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5506.58s)]
*  But we're not gonna we're not gonna basically frame every single episode into things that we think are bullshit. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5509.3s)]
*  There's a comedy podcast. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5515.860000000001s)]
*  But you don't know. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5516.66s)]
*  Oh we know. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5517.9400000000005s)]
*  Not all the time. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5519.22s)]
*  There's a way to game this shit and we choose not to do it. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5519.62s)]
*  We choose not to do it. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5522.34s)]
*  But you would have to have like a fact checker researcher sitting in studio writing in there. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5523.46s)]
*  I'm saying the opposite. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5527.86s)]
*  I'm saying we could go the we could go the extremist route. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5528.58s)]
*  Yelling have a really bad take about something and that shit will go. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5533.94s)]
*  But so many people be right. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5537.14s)]
*  We just think that they're not right because they're yelling. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5539.14s)]
*  And we think and they got and the internet has told us that they're what they're saying is not true. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5541.86s)]
*  I'm the type of person I gotta go researching myself. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5545.7s)]
*  You know I'm saying I'm not listening to social media. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5549.06s)]
*  Like yesterday was a great example right. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5551.14s)]
*  Nicki Minaj gets arrested. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5553.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5555.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5555.62s)]
*  Nicki tweets out. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5556.66s)]
*  And this happened in Amsterdam where weed is legal. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5558.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5560.9s)]
*  So my mind goes well maybe maybe weed isn't legal in Amsterdam. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5561.62s)]
*  Let me just go Google and see because I never knew. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5566.9800000000005s)]
*  You know you always hear these stories about Amsterdam red light district. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5569.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5571.3s)]
*  It's not legal in Amsterdam. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5571.94s)]
*  Well that wasn't the issue but yeah. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5574.1s)]
*  But it's legal in designated coffee shops in places where it's designated. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5575.54s)]
*  And I think you can only have up to like five grams or some shit like that. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5580.5s)]
*  So if she had a bunch of pre rolls maybe they were over five grand. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5584.74s)]
*  The issue is she was trying to travel to another country with them. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5587.78s)]
*  And that's where you get punished. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5590.9800000000005s)]
*  So at the Amsterdam airport if they see that you're bringing weed into onto your flight [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5592.18s)]
*  they can arrest you for that. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5597.3s)]
*  But my point is that's part of the law. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5598.74s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5600.74s)]
*  In her mind weed is legal in Amsterdam. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5601.62s)]
*  Which one isn't true and two you're bringing it to another state. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5604.1s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5607.7s)]
*  Or another country or whatever it is which is also illegal. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5608.1s)]
*  So they fine her for that. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5610.18s)]
*  But like. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5611.3s)]
*  Which we've seen happen in America. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5611.780000000001s)]
*  All the fucking time. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5613.06s)]
*  You might leave Cali with the weed and land in fucking. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5613.46s)]
*  I think Denver airport is like a thing. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5616.900000000001s)]
*  It's like an amnesty thing where you throw it out now. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5618.42s)]
*  Because if we catch you with it you're fucked. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5620.9800000000005s)]
*  So they throw it away here it's good. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5622.5s)]
*  You're good. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5625.14s)]
*  Security. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5625.54s)]
*  The way you throw it away. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5626.18s)]
*  Oh that's cool. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5627.06s)]
*  I like that. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5627.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5628.18s)]
*  They just have a box you can put it in. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5628.42s)]
*  That's I like that. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5629.62s)]
*  And all the TSA guys take it home. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5630.42s)]
*  That's great. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5631.54s)]

*  That's good faith. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5638.34s)]
*  And mad people on social media repeated it. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5639.06s)]
*  I saw that so much yesterday. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5641.620000000001s)]
*  Why is this happening to Nikki? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5643.38s)]
*  Weed is legal and after that. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5644.740000000001s)]
*  Not quite guys. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5646.18s)]

*  And then people will turn that story into anything that fits their argument. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5651.3s)]
*  So if their argument look how racist the world is. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5656.02s)]
*  They'll be like oh my god. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5658.02s)]
*  Sexist. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5658.900000000001s)]

*  What would you jump on? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5719.860000000001s)]
*  Mental health therapy that kind of thing. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5721.3s)]

*  Eh I'm doing that now. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5731.14s)]
*  What's the next grift? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5733.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know but my thing is like I cannot do it meaning that maybe it's just I'm not a contrarian [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5736.82s)]
*  but I have to just see what the other point of view is. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5745.38s)]
*  You're an intelligent person. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5749.22s)]
*  I have to. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5750.1s)]
*  You cannot just tell me something. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5751.46s)]
*  I have to go see what the other POV is. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5753.78s)]
*  Also if your contrarian nature inspires you to do that that's not a bad thing. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5756.34s)]
*  Whatever it is that makes you go out there and seek a little bit more information [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5762.74s)]
*  that's fantastic. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5766.259999999999s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5767.7s)]
*  You should. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5768.5s)]
*  Don't just take somebody's word for it. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5769.7s)]
*  Not even mine. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5771.38s)]
*  But you have to understand how hard that is when you're making money on it. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5772.34s)]
*  And a lot of people on the internet are making money. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5774.82s)]
*  They're paying their rent. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5777.139999999999s)]
*  They're paying their family's rent. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5778.34s)]
*  They have a responsibility now to go continue making this money in this way. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5779.94s)]
*  They quit their job. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5784.339999999999s)]
*  They're like holy shit I'm making money making YouTube videos now. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5785.219999999999s)]
*  I gotta keep these clicks up. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5787.94s)]
*  I gotta keep these views up. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5789.299999999999s)]
*  How do I do it? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5790.66s)]
*  Oh here's my currency. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5791.46s)]
*  I'm leaning into that. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5792.58s)]
*  The algorithm decides what they create not themselves. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5793.7s)]
*  It's the most inauthentic version of creation. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5796.74s)]
*  You are not creating for you. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5799.299999999999s)]
*  You are creating for others. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5800.66s)]
*  Yeah I talk about that in the book. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5803.0599999999995s)]
*  It's just like I know very smart people. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5804.339999999999s)]
*  Very intelligent people who are literally just telling people what they want to hear. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5807.3s)]
*  And it's so predictable. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5813.06s)]
*  And then they have the audacity to criticize. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5813.9400000000005s)]
*  You aren't even creating what you authentically want. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5816.58s)]
*  And you have the audacity to criticize. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5819.46s)]
*  The algorithm has decided who you are as a creator. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5821.7s)]
*  Oh my god man. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5824.900000000001s)]
*  No it's actually disgusting. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5826.5s)]
*  And they're influential. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5831.14s)]
*  People will believe them too. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5832.34s)]
*  I think it's coming to an end. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5833.46s)]
*  Yeah I think it's not sustainable. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5837.38s)]
*  That's what they don't realize. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5838.66s)]
*  It's not sustainable. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5839.62s)]
*  Initially it was because we just kind of believed anything that was produced. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5840.42s)]
*  We were like oh my god here's information. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5843.3s)]
*  It must be true. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5844.9s)]
*  Somebody put effort into making this. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5845.78s)]
*  And now that people are starting to see that there's like a grift [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5847.54s)]
*  and you can get views by doing certain things. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5850.1s)]
*  I think the public is starting to be skeptical of the same exact video being put out. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5852.58s)]
*  I think there still is a market for that. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5856.9800000000005s)]
*  But there's influence. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5858.82s)]
*  I think we underestimate how many people are lost. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5859.54s)]
*  To your point about religion giving guidance. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5862.5s)]
*  Since there's not as much religion. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5865.46s)]
*  Maybe Tim Dillon said this. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5866.9s)]
*  We're all kind of looking for God in something else. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5868.099999999999s)]
*  So if I'm a broken person who got treated. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5870.42s)]
*  Women treated me like shit. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5873.299999999999s)]
*  I never got no pussy. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5874.5s)]
*  I guess that's me but I didn't get angry about it. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5876.5s)]
*  True. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5878.0199999999995s)]
*  But you told not to get pussy. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5878.5s)]
*  It was religion. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5879.62s)]
*  But these people who they find these Red Bull guys and they're like [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5880.339999999999s)]
*  oh they're telling me exactly what I want to hear. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5883.219999999999s)]
*  I don't care what you expose about them. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5884.82s)]
*  I don't care if it's fake. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5886.339999999999s)]
*  That makes me feel good. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5887.54s)]
*  I know. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5888.58s)]
*  You see that with celebrity all the time. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5889.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5890.58s)]
*  And that's how I know people don't really be caring about the issues. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5892.1s)]
*  Like they care about the individual. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5894.58s)]
*  People got mad at me last week. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5897.38s)]
*  I didn't realize they got mad at me for some brilliant idiot shit. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5899.22s)]
*  I said months ago when we were talking about Ditty. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5901.46s)]
*  And I was just saying how when I see situations like this it's sad. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5904.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5907.9400000000005s)]
*  I did Dan Abrams show and he played the clip from idiots. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5909.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5912.900000000001s)]
*  But he played it without the context. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5913.38s)]
*  So the context was it's sad to see another person ruin their life. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5915.14s)]
*  Based off poor choices. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5920.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5922.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5922.98s)]
*  It's sad to see when these people crash and burn just because they've made poor [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5923.219999999999s)]
*  alleged porch at the time I said alleged poor choice. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5927.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5929.379999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5929.94s)]
*  So when somebody asked me about it was on the view they asked me about Ditty and I go [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5930.74s)]
*  I think we need to focus on the issue not the individual. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5935.62s)]
*  Because what happens a lot of times in these situations we get so caught up in the celebrity [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5939.62s)]
*  of it all that we we don't ever take the time to talk about what's the real core issue here. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5943.62s)]
*  To me it's domestic violence. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5948.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5949.459999999999s)]
*  It's these men that need to go do the work on themselves because they're dealing with [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5950.02s)]
*  all this hurt and this pain and this unhealed trauma and they're projecting that on the [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5953.46s)]
*  other women. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5956.34s)]
*  And it's the patriarchy because you got a guy like a Ditty who's in a position of power [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5956.9800000000005s)]
*  who probably don't look at any woman as an equal or as a. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5961.3s)]
*  It's a sociopathic power hungry narcissist. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5965.3s)]
*  But that's all that's still all mental health related that's still all something that you [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5968.820000000001s)]
*  need to go crazy people. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5971.700000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5972.9800000000005s)]
*  So my point is we don't ever talk about the issue. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5974.02s)]
*  Now it's a Ditty's music is banned from Peloton and the Ditty's eyeglasses are taken out. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5977.3s)]
*  Who gives a fuck whatever happens to him as an individual. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5982.740000000001s)]
*  He's got to deal with the consequences of his actions. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5985.9400000000005s)]
*  But the issue is still going to be going on. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5987.860000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5990.02s)]
*  As I'm talking right now somebody's getting their ass kicked. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5990.58s)]
*  Some woman's getting their ass kicked right now. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5992.66s)]
*  Nobody's even paying her no attention. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5993.9400000000005s)]
*  And then we move on once we see justice is served for the individual. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5995.3s)]
*  That's right. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5998.66s)]
*  We act as if the issue is taken care of. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=5999.14s)]
*  That's right. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6001.06s)]
*  Reality it's not taken care of. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6001.38s)]
*  No. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6003.62s)]
*  At all. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6004.02s)]
*  At all. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6004.5s)]
*  But our passivity comes in because we feel satisfied because we never cared about the [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6005.14s)]
*  issue. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6011.860000000001s)]
*  I've never cared as strong but like we cared more about the fact that this famous person [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6012.42s)]
*  we saw our whole lives is involved in this fucking thing. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6016.5s)]
*  Now I largely agree with you. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6020.42s)]
*  Could you make the argument that there is still some benefit in seeing we're going to [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6021.860000000001s)]
*  make an example out of this guy. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6025.54s)]
*  You're going to take this guy who was a demigod of sorts like so powerful and he's going to [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6026.660000000001s)]
*  be stripped to nothing and these are the consequences of those actions. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6030.740000000001s)]
*  Yes but you have to put the lesson in it right. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6033.86s)]
*  Like we can't have these small conversations about Diddy and what it means to his legacy [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6036.0199999999995s)]
*  whatever whatever we have to say this is what happens to your legacy when you do bullshit [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6042.339999999999s)]
*  behavior like this. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6048.099999999999s)]
*  I don't think we ever have those discussions when it comes to celebrities. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6050.74s)]
*  Like all we see is all of these guys get canceled all of these guys go to prison as they should. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6053.86s)]
*  R. Kelly same exact thing. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6059.139999999999s)]
*  The baby's talking about human trafficking. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6061.219999999999s)]
*  Nobody's talking about what's happening to these. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6062.9s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6064.82s)]
*  He pees on people. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6065.86s)]
*  That's it. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6066.74s)]
*  Which is hilarious. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6068.099999999999s)]
*  What's the lesson with Diddy? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6069.299999999999s)]
*  It's like oh he's gay. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6070.259999999999s)]
*  He pees on people. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6071.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah he's gay but it's not. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6071.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't know that yet. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6072.9s)]
*  Fair. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6075.379999999999s)]
*  What we know about Diddy is he absolutely puts his hands on women. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6077.62s)]
*  We've seen that. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6082.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that part's worse. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6082.58s)]
*  Than him being gay? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6084.58s)]
*  I don't know dude. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6086.66s)]
*  It depends how he's getting his butt. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6087.38s)]
*  I think we know he's gay though from that video. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6100.66s)]
*  Bro there's one story that's the- [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6103.86s)]
*  Don't jump away. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6106.5s)]
*  He did fight with flowers. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6107.3s)]
*  We do know that he's gay from that video. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6108.58s)]
*  Why? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6110.82s)]
*  Because of the way he's holding his towel? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6111.22s)]
*  No. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6112.58s)]
*  The socks. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6113.78s)]
*  I didn't notice the socks. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6115.3s)]
*  You didn't see the socks in the video? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6116.42s)]
*  No. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6118.02s)]
*  I didn't watch the video. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6119.3s)]
*  Big job paying attention to it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6120.34s)]
*  I thought you saw him pull her down and kick. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6121.7s)]
*  I didn't watch that part. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6125.38s)]
*  I just watched the socks. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6126.42s)]
*  I watched him like Joker walking through the hallway and his pink fuchsia socks. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6127.7s)]
*  And I was like oh this guy's definitely gay. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6132.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6135.46s)]
*  That was the first thing I thought. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6136.9s)]
*  I didn't know they were pink. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6138.26s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6139.22s)]
*  He put on her socks. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6142.18s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6143.86s)]
*  Because it's a power thing. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6145.06s)]
*  It's grippy. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6146.580000000001s)]
*  It's grippy bro. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6147.620000000001s)]
*  Drugs like a motherfucker. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6149.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6152.18s)]
*  Gotta be. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6152.820000000001s)]
*  That's clear. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6153.46s)]
*  And she said he was intoxicated and shit. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6154.02s)]
*  But you are Sean P. Diddy Combs. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6156.580000000001s)]
*  And you're in the Intercontinental Hotel and you run out in a towel. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6161.38s)]
*  This was 2000 what 16 or 18? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6164.820000000001s)]
*  This guy was 46 years old. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6167.700000000001s)]
*  You're a multi-millionaire but I don't talk about this. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6171.620000000001s)]
*  No drug makes you beat a woman. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6174.42s)]
*  You beat women and then you do it. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6176.66s)]
*  Yeah it's not only drugs. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6179.62s)]
*  Yeah I'm not saying it's not only drugs but this isn't regular behavior bro. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6180.82s)]
*  I think it's regular for him. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6186.18s)]
*  You're running in a hotel with a towel on. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6187.38s)]
*  I agree with him. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6189.22s)]
*  I think it's regular for him. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6189.860000000001s)]
*  I think he's such a fucking monster. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6191.14s)]
*  The amount of times you gotta hit your girl to not give a fuck that you're in public. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6192.66s)]
*  Yes that's what I'm saying. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6196.02s)]
*  But I think he's just such a power hungry person that I think he feels invincible when [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6197.3s)]
*  he has the power and these types of things unfortunately make him feel invincible. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6202.74s)]
*  Top or bottom? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6206.5s)]
*  What? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6207.86s)]
*  Top or bottom? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6208.5s)]
*  Oh did he? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6209.3s)]
*  Power bottom. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6209.94s)]
*  I think honestly I think it's top and I don't even think it's a gay thing. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6210.5s)]

*  shit right away because we've all heard things about Diddy for a long time. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6251.3s)]

*  Yeah but we heard that we said that about Tom Cruise too with Katie Holmes. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6262.34s)]
*  Yeah I never heard of him. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6265.38s)]
*  I didn't think I would ever see a video like this. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6267.14s)]
*  I heard abuse whispers so I was thinking yeah. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6269.38s)]
*  I heard gay I never heard forms of abuse. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6271.94s)]
*  I always heard gay non-stop and that was enough people were like. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6274.42s)]
*  That's because of Wendy Williams. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6277.54s)]
*  What'd she say? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6278.98s)]
*  Oh with me. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6279.7s)]
*  Wendy Wendy whole thing was Diddy was gay since the 90s. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6280.34s)]
*  She knew dog. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6283.14s)]
*  No Wendy was throwing that out there. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6283.94s)]
*  That's why Wendy got fired from Hot 97. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6285.78s)]
*  Wendy got fired from Hot 97 by Diddy because that's when bad boy was smoking hot. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6287.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6292.26s)]
*  And yeah she got fired for putting that out there. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6292.58s)]
*  You think that Diddy held on to the gay rumors so that people didn't know what he really was? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6295.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6299.54s)]
*  Because that's the perfect smoke screen. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6300.74s)]
*  You'd rather people think you're gay than beat women. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6302.98s)]
*  By the way here's the wild thing we still don't know what Diddy is. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6305.22s)]
*  I mean we know a little. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6308.66s)]
*  We know a little we know bits and pieces. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6309.46s)]
*  This shit might be deeper than rap. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6312.26s)]
*  We don't know like this might be a whole rabbit hole. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6314.5s)]
*  You might be like oh shit. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6316.58s)]
*  But seeing this video. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6317.86s)]
*  That's what I was trying to get at this whole time. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6319.3s)]
*  That is that wildest story that came out of a lot of this shit and nobody gives a fuck. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6322.18s)]
*  Yo let's talk about it. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6327.62s)]

*  Put it up. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6328.9s)]
*  What about Carl Winsor? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6329.46s)]
*  I don't even want to repeat it. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6329.86s)]
*  This shit sounds so crazy. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6332.98s)]
*  No this shit is wild. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6334.66s)]
*  No typing that typing his name in Diddy. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6335.62s)]
*  But this is why I believe all the Cassie allegations because of this video. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6338.26s)]
*  Because she describes this what happened there to the T. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6342.74s)]
*  I believe everything she said. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6347.3s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6348.42s)]

*  Yeah I'm not I'm not I yeah. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6349.38s)]
*  This is horrifying. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6350.9800000000005s)]
*  Also also Diddy's bullshit while you're getting that Diddy's bullshit [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6351.7s)]
*  that's excuse like how he couldn't mention Cassie's name in the apology. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6354.26s)]
*  There's no rule you can't apologize. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6357.78s)]
*  Whoever. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6359.7s)]
*  I'm not laughing at that. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6360.34s)]
*  No I know you're not. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6361.38s)]
*  I'm laughing at this that market. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6362.5s)]
*  Also you called her a liar like three days ago. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6364.26s)]
*  Yeah like get the fuck out of here. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6366.66s)]
*  Said she was looking after for a quick buck. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6368.02s)]
*  You're a fucking scumbag. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6369.54s)]
*  Maybe there's more triggering for me because whatever but like that shit. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6370.74s)]
*  Why is there more triggering for you? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6373.78s)]
*  I grew up in a house and I didn't see that ever but I grew up in a house where there was abuse. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6374.9s)]
*  So it was like you watch that and this is way more extreme than anything I saw. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6378.099999999999s)]
*  Like she's trying to sneak out of the fucking room. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6382.66s)]
*  He's dragging her by the hair. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6384.74s)]
*  Not gonna pimp my struggle. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6386.5s)]
*  I didn't see anything like that but watching that is like you know fuck this guy forever. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6388.259999999999s)]
*  Did you ever try to intervene? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6391.7s)]
*  Yeah I did one time. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6392.98s)]
*  You got your ass kicked. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6394.179999999999s)]
*  No we didn't do anything I just stood in his way and I didn't say a word I didn't even look at him. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6395.139999999999s)]
*  Which I'm kind of like I just got in his way and I remember thinking if I have to if this goes down. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6398.58s)]
*  This goes down. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6403.62s)]
*  That's all I remember. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6405.22s)]
*  I remember I was reading Will Smith's book and he always said he felt bad because he never intervened. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6406.02s)]
*  So that was like he said he felt like a coward. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6412.1s)]
*  You know he never intervened watching his mother go through the abuse from his father. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6414.820000000001s)]
*  But I think he said his brother did. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6418.820000000001s)]
*  So it just a lot of that just makes you kind of think about everything that happened. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6421.3s)]
*  That everything that transpired transpired with the slap and all of that. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6424.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6427.54s)]
*  I'm gonna stand up for myself finally. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6429.46s)]
*  You didn't play the clip. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6431.3s)]

*  Let's keep it keep it a buck. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6446.820000000001s)]
*  No that's why a lot of people look quiet. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6448.26s)]
*  And out of those five or six how many the first one the first one was the the worst one and then [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=6453.700000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7045.12s)]
*  I bet you your computer will fucking freeze up. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7045.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah explode. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7046.96s)]
*  Immediately. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7047.76s)]
*  But you can answer your advantage too. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7049.52s)]
*  Let's say you say something and they say say aye. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7050.8s)]
*  You have this you say aye. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7052.88s)]
*  Y'all two years late. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7053.92s)]
*  I've been doing that. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7054.72s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7055.360000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7057.04s)]
*  So it goes both ways. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7057.76s)]
*  I've been doing that. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7058.88s)]
*  Yeah that's your trick. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7059.76s)]
*  They aye. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7060.8s)]
*  I don't even think people care about. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7062.32s)]
*  You cannot care about old shit no more because of AI. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7063.84s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7067.04s)]
*  And that's going to be the crazy thing. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7067.52s)]
*  What a relief. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7068.56s)]
*  Because you don't know. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7070.08s)]
*  And that's the other scary part about life right. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7071.28s)]
*  If you got to navigate through every single thing that somebody puts on your table. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7074.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7079.12s)]
*  Like before I even determine what my opinion or feeling about it is. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7079.360000000001s)]
*  I got to figure out if it's real first. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7082.96s)]
*  Who got time? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7084.8s)]
*  Nah don't have. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7085.6s)]
*  I ain't got time. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7086.400000000001s)]
*  So fuck it. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7087.2s)]
*  I don't even care. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7087.76s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7089.76s)]
*  What do you think happens with the legislation shit? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7090.64s)]
*  Because I saw that I think Scarlett Johansson. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7093.92s)]
*  I don't know if she was suing or she was complaining that. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7097.12s)]
*  She said her lawyers are looking into it. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7100.320000000001s)]
*  Okay they are. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7102.0s)]
*  So Chad GBT released the voice for their AI. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7102.88s)]
*  And it sounds like Scarlett's voice in her. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7106.64s)]
*  Which is a movie where she voices an AI. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7109.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7111.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah and I think even Sam Altman the guy who runs Chad GBT tweeted out her. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7111.68s)]
*  Now they also engaged Scarlett Johansson's agents to see if they could use her voice. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7116.72s)]
*  And then they ended up not doing it. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7121.76s)]
*  I guess the point is like. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7124.64s)]
*  And this is no different than anything else right. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7126.64s)]
*  A new thing pops up and you have to find some legislation for it to protect people's intellectual property. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7128.32s)]
*  But she should be able to sue if they're using her IP. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7133.36s)]
*  But I wonder what is the legality of impressions. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7137.36s)]
*  Apparently the woman that they got to do this like their defense is they say. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7140.32s)]
*  I know some people are saying it sounds like Scarlett Johansson. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7144.400000000001s)]
*  She's saying that yada yada. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7146.56s)]
*  But we hired a voice actress that happens to have a similar intonation from a region. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7147.92s)]
*  Dove do you remember the radio commercial in California when we were going to school. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7151.52s)]
*  It was an impression. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7156.96s)]
*  It was like for some auto thing. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7158.320000000001s)]
*  But it was an impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7160.0s)]
*  An impression of. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7162.320000000001s)]
*  It was like three or four impressions and it clearly wasn't those people. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7164.4800000000005s)]
*  But an impression is using their voice. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7168.0s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7169.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7170.5599999999995s)]
*  But I guess I remember hearing this on the radio going how can they get away with this shit. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7171.2s)]
*  They're using somebody's likeness to promote a product that they're not getting compensated for. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7174.16s)]
*  So can you just do an impression of somebody. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7180.5599999999995s)]
*  And if you can do an impression of people. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7182.4s)]
*  A.I.'s impression is going to be perfect. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7184.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7187.839999999999s)]
*  Is A.I. an impression though. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7188.4s)]
*  I think parody you're allowed to do on our parody. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7190.48s)]
*  Oh whoa whoa that's a great point. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7192.4s)]
*  Sorry is A.I. is not an impression. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7193.919999999999s)]
*  It is the actual synthesis of the person. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7196.16s)]
*  The actual synthesis of that voice where parody is an impression. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7198.8s)]
*  So A.I. is fraud. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7204.4800000000005s)]
*  A.I. is identity. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7206.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7208.320000000001s)]
*  That's why they took her voice down immediately. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7209.68s)]
*  Oh so they stop it. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7211.68s)]
*  Yeah immediately. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7212.56s)]
*  Okay that makes sense. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7213.360000000001s)]
*  Oh so it's all a complaint they pulled it. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7214.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7215.92s)]
*  Oh so that's an admission of guilt but I still need some money for paying the damages. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7216.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7219.28s)]
*  For real like you had people fucking asking me about shit that I didn't want to be asked about. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7221.52s)]
*  Like seriously people running up on me in the airport asking me about whatever the [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7225.84s)]
*  fuck was on that commercial I don't know anything about it. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7228.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7230.08s)]
*  You know and now I feel stupid I don't want to feel stupid. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7230.719999999999s)]
*  So you made me have put me in a position to feel stupid so I need some money for that. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7232.719999999999s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7236.96s)]
*  I don't see the problem. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7237.84s)]
*  Don't sue us Charlotte. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7238.48s)]
*  Sue Jack. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7240.8s)]

*  No for real. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7247.04s)]
*  Lawsuits are not easy to win. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7249.36s)]
*  So if you're going to win them you might as well get some. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7250.5599999999995s)]
*  You got to get yeah because it's going to cost you money that's the thing people don't [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7251.84s)]

*  Oh yeah just hiring the it just that process is crazy and what they don't realize is sometimes [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7266.08s)]
*  bigger people like maybe yourself others have a lawyer on retainer so you're already paying them. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7271.68s)]

*  ayahuasca experience that made me um have a revelation and it was stop lying to yourself [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7726.56s)]
*  and stop volunteering those lies to other people because we all wake up every day and we throw on [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7733.04s)]
*  a mask right like and and sometimes you don't even mean to you just do it because gets you through [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7738.320000000001s)]

*  around without any sort of armor to always be your vulnerable authentic self that's hard [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7748.64s)]
*  that's difficult but like but day two of my ayahuasca journey that came up and then that's [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhDwWNlVmE&t=7755.04s)]
