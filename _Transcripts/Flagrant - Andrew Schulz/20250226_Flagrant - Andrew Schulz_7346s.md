*  What was that like? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=220.0s)]
*  Your neighbor. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=221.0s)]
*  He's just a legend. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=222.0s)]
*  There's a funny take that we did not use [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=223.0s)]
*  and I was like bullying Dove into doing it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=224.0s)]
*  But you know the line where he gets up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=226.0s)]
*  and he goes, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=228.0s)]
*  Andrew Schultz has a special [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=229.0s)]
*  where his balls are made out of oatmeal. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=230.0s)]
*  So in the skit, Dove looks at the oatmeal [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=232.0s)]
*  and then he just puts it down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=235.0s)]
*  I go, yo, you know what would be even funnier. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=237.0s)]
*  Andrew Schultz has a comedy special [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=239.0s)]
*  about how his balls are full of oatmeal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=241.0s)]
*  Now, to get him to do that, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=248.0s)]
*  we went through like 10 different takes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=250.0s)]
*  Also Dove is so adorable because like [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=252.0s)]
*  there's this moment for the cutaway [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=254.0s)]
*  and he's like, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=256.0s)]
*  it's like he's George Clooney. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=258.0s)]
*  Like he is locked in. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=259.0s)]
*  He's coming up to me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=261.0s)]
*  He goes, so what do you think my motivation is? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=262.0s)]
*  Am I nervous? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=265.0s)]
*  Am I anxious? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=266.0s)]
*  Am I like shocked? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=268.0s)]
*  Dove is actually such a good actor. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=269.0s)]
*  He's a really good actor. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=270.0s)]
*  It's annoying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=271.0s)]
*  But you also, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=272.0s)]
*  it's also, I don't understand. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=273.0s)]
*  It's like you're acting a piece [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=274.0s)]
*  with fucking the march. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=276.0s)]
*  But he's, so he's coming. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=277.0s)]
*  It's like, what do you think it is? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=278.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=279.0s)]
*  I think that you know you're eating oatmeal [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=280.0s)]
*  and somebody says your balls are mad. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=281.0s)]
*  So you're grossed out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=282.0s)]
*  And he goes, okay, so I would look up, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=283.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, I don't know if Matt Damon [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=288.0s)]
*  was in a diner and you were eating [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=289.0s)]
*  and he started giving a speech. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=290.0s)]
*  Would you look up? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=291.0s)]
*  He goes, yes, I probably would. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=292.0s)]
*  We did more takes on Dove eating that oatmeal [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=294.0s)]
*  than me and Matt doing the entire thing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=296.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was an hour. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=298.0s)]
*  It was an hour. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=299.0s)]
*  How did you get into character for that role? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=300.0s)]
*  What was your... [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=301.0s)]
*  I went deep. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=302.0s)]
*  And I think what I locked in on, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=303.0s)]
*  someone wrote in the comments, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=304.0s)]
*  I guess Middle Eastern River model. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah, he made a little Middle Eastern River model. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=307.0s)]
*  No, but it was like we had a food decorator [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=312.0s)]
*  and it was like, oh, it doesn't plop. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=315.0s)]
*  Now you gotta add milk to it, make it runny. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=317.0s)]
*  I went lefty, so I protect the face. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=319.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=321.0s)]
*  He went lefty. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=322.0s)]
*  I mean, he really put himself out there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=323.0s)]
*  Do you know how hard it is for Dove [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=324.0s)]
*  to do a scene where he doesn't eat food? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=325.0s)]
*  That's really difficult. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=326.0s)]
*  No, but shout out Matt Damon, man. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=328.0s)]
*  Shout out Matt Damon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=330.0s)]
*  Absolute legend. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=331.0s)]
*  Absolute legend. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=332.0s)]
*  Absolutely incredible. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=333.0s)]
*  I literally hit him up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=334.0s)]
*  I should see the text. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=335.0s)]
*  I'm basically asking him to say no in the text. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=336.0s)]
*  And I probably rewrote that text four different times. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=339.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=342.0s)]
*  Because I don't want to be like, too, was it presumptuous? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=343.0s)]
*  I can't assume you would say yes to doing this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=346.0s)]
*  And I know you have a million different things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=348.0s)]
*  Legend. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=350.0s)]
*  Shout out Tory Lanez, bro. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=353.0s)]
*  Tory, we need you on the pod. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=355.0s)]
*  You need that promo with Tory Lanez, bro. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=356.0s)]
*  Freestyle from prison? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=358.0s)]
*  Did you hear one of his songs got cut off by a fight that broke out? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=359.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=363.0s)]
*  Like he was recording, I guess, through the phone. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=364.0s)]
*  And in the background, like a riot happened. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=366.0s)]
*  The Tory's 5'3". [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=368.0s)]
*  That's the first cheeks that are gone. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=369.0s)]
*  So, but no, I hit him up and I was like, dude, please say no to this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=372.0s)]
*  You have way too many things to do to be busy about this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=378.0s)]
*  But I got a funny idea for a promo for the special. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=381.0s)]
*  If you're down, you let me know. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=384.0s)]
*  And he was like, he's like, yeah, can we do it like between eight and three? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=385.0s)]
*  That's when the kids are at school. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=389.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=390.0s)]
*  He goes, what day is good for you? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=392.0s)]
*  I go, what day is good for you? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=394.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=396.0s)]
*  Like before this, I hadn't really thought it was going to happen. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=397.0s)]
*  So I had a loose idea. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=400.0s)]
*  And the second he did it, it became even more anxiety. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=404.0s)]
*  Because now I got to write something funny. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=405.0s)]
*  So I wrote this thing with a couple of guys. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=407.0s)]
*  Mark was definitely helping out. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=409.0s)]
*  Joey Avery is helping out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=410.0s)]
*  And then immediately I was like, I cannot fuck this up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=411.0s)]
*  So I hit up Neil, Neil Brennan. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=415.0s)]
*  And Neil was fucking awesome. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=417.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=419.0s)]
*  Neil was awesome. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=420.0s)]
*  So Neil was really helpful. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=421.0s)]
*  And then he was like, hey, I got to go film the Odyssey Friday. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=422.0s)]
*  Do you think we could do Thursday? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=426.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=428.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, you got to go film Christopher Nolan. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=429.0s)]
*  You're the star of it? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=431.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=432.0s)]
*  I think we could work around your schedule. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=433.0s)]
*  So you asked him the way that you actually did it in the sketch. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=434.0s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=437.0s)]
*  Where you were like, yeah, you won't do this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=438.0s)]
*  You probably don't have what it takes to do this role. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=440.0s)]
*  He's like, I'll fucking do it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=442.0s)]
*  I've been to Boston. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=443.0s)]
*  That's what Neil found. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=444.0s)]
*  Neil was like, listen, if you tell a guy from Boston what to do, he will or not to do something, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=445.0s)]
*  he will do it just because that's the energy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=453.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=454.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=455.0s)]
*  But yeah, he said he was down to it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=456.0s)]
*  And I got to give him credit for a lot of the funny too, because when we were riffing in the trailer, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=458.0s)]
*  which was a surreal moment to be riffing a scene. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=461.0s)]
*  Are you nervous in that moment? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=464.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't nervous, but I had like an adrenaline dump afterwards. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=465.0s)]
*  Afterwards, I just want to go to sleep. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=469.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=471.0s)]
*  But like I was in there with the director. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=472.0s)]
*  Shout out Mel B. Mel B. Mel B. Director. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=474.0s)]
*  Andrew Mel. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=477.0s)]

*  Like the departed. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=525.0s)]
*  But he always plays the nice guy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=526.0s)]
*  He's actually bad. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=527.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=539.0s)]
*  It's like comical. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=541.0s)]
*  So in American sniper, they have this really dramatic scene where the main dude is like [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=542.0s)]
*  with his child, like arguing with his wife. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=547.0s)]

*  Let's just look at this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=758.0s)]
*  So Steve Smith Sr., prolific wide receiver, like 5'9", firecracker, also would beat the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=759.0s)]
*  shit out of you. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=768.0s)]

*  He's like on the field. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=771.0s)]
*  He was like the Aaron, the plumber of the NFL. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=772.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=773.6s)]

*  But he actually won every fight. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=776.6s)]
*  He would beat the shit out of people much bigger than him. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=777.6s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=780.6s)]
*  He said, turn you over into deep inside of you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=781.6s)]
*  She said, you're so hot. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=784.6s)]
*  Deep is an understatement. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=785.6s)]
*  It felt like you were going to rearrange my IUD. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=786.6s)]
*  You are so deep. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=789.6s)]
*  No, that's crazy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=790.6s)]
*  Imagine your wife texted somebody. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=791.6s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=792.6s)]
*  Why are you happy about this, son? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=794.2s)]
*  You got a wife. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=796.2s)]
*  No, I'm not happy that she's cheating, but I'm like, yeah, rearranging some IUDs. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=797.2s)]
*  I like that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=802.2s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=803.2s)]
*  That's bad for, for, for, for feminine health. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=804.2s)]
*  You can't rearrange. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=807.2s)]

*  Oh, little choice he made, like when he said the red tube and he covered the baby's ears. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1330.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1333.84s)]
*  That was good, dude. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1334.84s)]
*  And that was our fault. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1335.84s)]
*  We didn't have coverage of him. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1336.84s)]
*  There's certain things that you want to have coverage of everything. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1337.84s)]
*  Coverage just means you want to film every single angle of it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1341.56s)]
*  And that's something I realized about Curb Your Enthusiasm that is so smart, is that [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1344.24s)]
*  every scene they shoot, I'm pretty sure, they... [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1349.1999999999998s)]
*  What's that? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1352.48s)]
*  I think they do triple coverage. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1353.48s)]
*  They'll do like a wide shot and then two side shots. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1354.52s)]
*  And then the problem with it, there's not really a problem, but like the scenes, like [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1357.4s)]
*  if you're like a fucking cinematographer, like they look kind of like flat or whatever. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1361.68s)]
*  There's not these like beautiful moves. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1365.4s)]
*  But the reality is what we care the most about is the interaction. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1367.04s)]
*  And there's no way, like on a traditional sitcom, it's usually set up, punch. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1370.88s)]
*  But in Curb, it's argument. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1375.84s)]
*  And the only way you could get them going is if you have them both covered and then [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1378.52s)]
*  just riffing. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1382.16s)]
*  One of the cool things about Curb is you could see them break a little. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1383.2s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1385.68s)]
*  There's one I always remember where Larry's friend Richard Lewis, who passed away, but [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1386.68s)]
*  he's upset about something because I think he said Jerry stole, I mean, Larry stole his [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1391.4s)]
*  voicemail greeting and he's like, I want you to change yours by sunset. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1394.92s)]
*  And then Larry laughs, he goes, by sunset? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1398.88s)]
*  Were you Gary Cooper? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1401.3600000000001s)]
*  But you could tell by sunset made him laugh. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  And then Richard laughs at Gary, Gary Cooper is like some old cowboy movie guy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1405.52s)]
*  And so then the Richard starts laughing and he's like, change the thing. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1409.38s)]
*  It's like, oh, y'all are both just making each other laugh right now. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1412.4s)]
*  So how much do you think like going into, let's say you're going into Curb and you're [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1415.24s)]
*  not like a newbie, you have a relationship with them. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1418.52s)]
*  How much are you keeping in the tuck to surprise them for real? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1421.16s)]
*  And how much are you going over beforehand? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1426.8400000000001s)]
*  Like this would be a funny thing. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1429.76s)]
*  Apparently he just goes in and says, like, this is what the scene is about. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1430.76s)]
*  And then you guys go. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1433.52s)]
*  Yeah, I thought they have a skeleton, like where it needs to start, where it needs to [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1434.1200000000001s)]
*  end, do one run through and then they do another run through where it's like, ah, riff [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1437.2800000000002s)]
*  as much as you want. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1441.44s)]
*  And then they just try to. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1442.44s)]
*  But if you got a banger, you save it for that second run through. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1443.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1445.44s)]
*  Like what some people do is like they wait until they get their coverage. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1446.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1449.8400000000001s)]
*  So like if you're not on camera, you're kind of going through the motions in the second [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1450.8400000000001s)]
*  you get it. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1454.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1455.8s)]
*  What some people do. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1456.8s)]
*  I didn't know that that's what people do. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1457.8s)]
*  So like when you're super low on the call sheet, like when nobody gives a fuck, like every [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1460.64s)]
*  role I've ever had. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1464.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1465.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not even on camera and I'm like giving it my best. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'll have lines of like, oh, I got that shit. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1468.68s)]
*  And then it will come back to my coverage and then all the actors leave. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1471.48s)]
*  You just there with the stand ins like I just use my hot shit. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1475.72s)]
*  I can't run this back. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1478.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1479.64s)]
*  Me and Miles are just watching a video of Celine Dion getting upstaged by a singer. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1480.64s)]
*  And when they did the run through the rehearsal, he was kind of phoning it in. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1484.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1487.44s)]
*  And then they got on TV in Sweden and he fucking crushed. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1489.0s)]
*  And you just see her face just go like, what the fuck is this guy? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1492.44s)]
*  She gets pissed. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1495.16s)]
*  You have a little. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1496.16s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1497.16s)]
*  Let me pull this up. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1498.16s)]
*  See, now he's doing too much. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1499.96s)]
*  I mean, kind of fired. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1505.52s)]
*  If you're that guy, apparently he's like a super famous like Swedish singer. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1507.72s)]
*  And she was the mom and she was like, I'm going to do him a little favor. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1510.4s)]
*  I'm like going to his little show, like help him out. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1513.52s)]
*  Yeah. And then he busts that up. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1515.72s)]
*  I love watching those videos. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1516.96s)]
*  She looks tired about it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  She's not happy. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1520.24s)]
*  You brought me to Stockholm for this fucking. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1521.88s)]
*  Fuck it. Embarrass me. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1524.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm smooth. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1525.96s)]
*  Can you share what the mad name and cutaway was going to be? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1527.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was first like it was before he agreed. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1531.96s)]
*  I was like, you know, all you got to do is you just got to be there. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1535.0s)]
*  And what the fuck was it? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1537.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1539.28s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I got a special. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1540.8s)]
*  I actually forgot. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1541.92s)]
*  It was going to cut away to a bunch of his films. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1543.2s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1545.28s)]
*  So the yeah. All right. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1547.32s)]
*  So the original one was we were going to compete, right. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1548.88s)]
*  And I show mine and then he goes, oh, you want to play this game with me? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1551.08s)]
*  I'll play it. Let's fucking you want to play this game. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1554.68s)]
*  Let's play this game. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1556.16s)]
*  And then he goes and it's all of his greatest films. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1556.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. And then the last scene is behind the candelabra, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1559.96s)]
*  the one where he plays Michael Douglas's boyfriend. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1564.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And he's like hooking up with Michael Douglas. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1567.68s)]

*  And he's like, yeah, it's some of my best work. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, this this right. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1576.8s)]
*  Bro, I had never seen this. This is far. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1579.76s)]
*  Michael Douglas was a wig like hella like Al Pacino. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1582.04s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1584.32s)]

*  See, you see that? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1589.12s)]
*  They make everybody do that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  Probably. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1591.84s)]
*  But he did this after he made. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1596.28s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1598.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, you got to love David. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1599.76s)]
*  That's how you stay in. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1600.56s)]
*  Even like the Boston and it kind of comes out here a little bit. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1601.24s)]
*  He's like, I'm not going to kiss you back. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1603.24s)]

*  Akash can't watch these videos. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1610.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1613.24s)]
*  But you sort of tuck your head [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1615.88s)]
*  but keep it looking in the right direction. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1617.16s)]

*  And then I started like really cleaning it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1814.76s)]
*  And then one time she didn't. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1817.0s)]

*  It was unbelievably clean. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1844.76s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1846.32s)]
*  It's time to get your money up. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1847.9599999999998s)]
*  And not for now, OK, for the future. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1849.12s)]
*  You want to find a way to get your money up now? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1853.0s)]
*  You got to go somewhere else. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1854.6799999999998s)]
*  That's not what I'm talking about right now. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1855.72s)]
*  And that's not what Acorns is about. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1856.9199999999998s)]
*  Acorns is a financial wellness app that helps you use the magic of compound [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1858.56s)]
*  interest to take control of your money. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1862.8s)]
*  They have simple tools that make it easy to start saving and investing [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1864.9599999999998s)]
*  for your future. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1868.72s)]
*  OK, you don't have to be an expert. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1869.92s)]
*  But remember, this is about investing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1871.92s)]
*  I think that we've been manipulated and tricked [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1874.08s)]
*  to the benefit of many different companies out there [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1877.68s)]
*  to think that gambling is investing, just picking random stocks [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1881.1200000000001s)]
*  and hoping they're going to skyrocket up and getting out quickly. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1884.56s)]
*  That is not investing. That is gambling. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1887.1200000000001s)]
*  Investing is putting your money, parking it and letting compound [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1889.08s)]
*  interest take place. OK, what that money is, that same amount [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1893.8s)]
*  one year is going to be so much more you could ever imagine 20 years later. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  And that's going to set you up for financial security. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1901.76s)]
*  And that's the that's the goal with Acorns, right? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1904.8000000000002s)]
*  They will recommend a diversified portfolio that matches your money, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1907.04s)]
*  your goals, whatever it is. 100% personalized. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1910.24s)]

*  All right, they're not charging you per transaction. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1913.92s)]
*  OK, they want to do that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1916.24s)]
*  They'd be like all these other which are actually gambling sites, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  not investment sites that are making money per thing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1920.48s)]
*  That's not what they're doing. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1923.1200000000001s)]
*  What they're trying to do is set you up for financial security [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1923.92s)]
*  or allow you to do that for yourself. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1926.16s)]
*  OK, you want to do that for your kids. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1928.0s)]
*  You can even do that for your parents. OK, you also don't need to be rich to do this. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1929.52s)]
*  Acorns lets you get started with the spare money you've got right now, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=1933.2s)]

*  I told you. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2225.86s)]
*  Say, Mark threw up all over my bathroom in college once. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2227.36s)]
*  And we just left the door closed for three days until he came back and cleaned it. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2230.32s)]
*  It was so fucking bad. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2233.2s)]

*  Literally. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2242.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2252.56s)]
*  Is your cleaning lady worried about getting sent back? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2253.04s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2256.72s)]

*  It's not like you're asking for help. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2286.08s)]
*  What the fuck am I going to do? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2288.08s)]
*  Well, I could marry her. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2289.52s)]
*  I'm not married. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2290.56s)]
*  I'm not married. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2292.32s)]

*  It's not like that doesn't pop up on one of their feeds. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2307.12s)]
*  They're just on TikTok or Instagram or some shit. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2310.4s)]
*  And then they see us all sitting down with the guy who's going to kick them out. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2312.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think slavery pops up on my cleaner lady's feet. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2316.08s)]

*  That's just the point. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2325.36s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2326.0s)]

*  They never give up that much info. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2350.56s)]
*  She wants to know how dirty you are, which you thought around. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2352.88s)]
*  Bro, because I was asking her today, I was like, do you have kids? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2355.84s)]

*  And then I did that fucking classic white thing where I was trying to relate. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2384.8s)]
*  I don't know why I did this. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2390.2400000000002s)]

*  It's a bummer. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2410.08s)]
*  I've done that. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2410.56s)]
*  Oh. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2411.04s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2411.6s)]
*  We had a place. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2412.08s)]
*  As you get richer, you stop relating to minorities. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2412.24s)]
*  It's just like a thing that happens. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2414.48s)]
*  I relate to you. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2415.44s)]
*  Do you? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2417.52s)]
*  No. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2418.08s)]
*  I did that one time. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2419.68s)]
*  We had a bunch of moving guys from China. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2420.3199999999997s)]
*  And they didn't really speak much English, but fully Chinese. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2422.3199999999997s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I'll play some music. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2425.04s)]
*  Ship them back. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2426.16s)]
*  Chinese moving? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2426.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  I never. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2428.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2429.44s)]
*  They might have been spies. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2429.9199999999996s)]
*  I've seen Jewish moving guys. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2430.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2432.64s)]
*  Moishas. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2433.12s)]
*  How far down the fucking ladder do you have to be? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2433.52s)]
*  Dude, where you got a bunch of guys with yarmulkes and the girls [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2436.96s)]

*  They're like, they're putting people's shit out of their house. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2446.96s)]
*  They're the experts. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2454.48s)]
*  They'll get you out in 30 minutes. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2455.36s)]
*  Dove's not here for this, Kyle. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2457.84s)]
*  Dove left the room immediately. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2459.36s)]
*  But no, these Chinese guys came in. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2461.04s)]
*  I was like, yo, what do you want me to play? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2462.32s)]
*  Is there any music you guys really like? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2463.68s)]
*  And they're like, no, it's whatever. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2465.2s)]
*  So I was playing a Chinese techno song or whatever. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2466.24s)]
*  It was an Asian techno song. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh god, dude. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2470.16s)]
*  And I was trying to help them feel comfy. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2470.96s)]
*  And then by the end, I was like, where are you guys from, by the way? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2474.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, we're Kazakh. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2476.0s)]
*  Yeah, wrong Asian. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2478.96s)]
*  My bad. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2479.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2480.4s)]
*  My bad, dude. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2480.72s)]
*  Just Muslims. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2481.44s)]
*  I didn't know Kazakhs looked Asian. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2482.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2483.68s)]
*  I think the Koreans got over there somehow, man. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2484.72s)]
*  Deadass. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2488.08s)]
*  Are they just Koreans? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2488.56s)]
*  Yeah, them Koreans. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2489.44s)]
*  I thought they were Borat. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2490.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think Koreans got over there. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2492.16s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2493.92s)]
*  Look that up. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2495.12s)]
*  Let me find out. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2496.72s)]
*  Because there's a bunch of those Koreans in... [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2497.44s)]
*  They look like Middle Eastern Asian mix. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2499.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2502.0s)]
*  I mean, that's probably that Silk Road shit too. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2502.4s)]
*  But that guy, Bivul, the guy who fought this past weekend, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2505.2799999999997s)]
*  who was phenomenal fight, Bitter Beer versus Bivul. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2507.92s)]
*  If you want to see highest level boxing, watch that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2510.16s)]
*  One and two. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2512.56s)]
*  Two was this past weekend, Bivul won. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2513.3599999999997s)]
*  But he's half Korean. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2516.16s)]
*  So I think Koreans made their way into the USSR somehow. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, this is hilarious. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2522.24s)]
*  In the 1930s, thousands of Koreans in the Soviet Union [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2523.2s)]
*  were deported to Central Asia. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2525.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2527.04s)]
*  Supposedly to prevent further Japanese espionage. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2527.52s)]
*  That's one way of doing it. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2532.3999999999996s)]
*  We put them in the camp. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2534.08s)]
*  They just let them go to Central Asia. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2535.68s)]
*  That's kind of nice. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2537.52s)]
*  It's also hilarious. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2538.24s)]
*  Deporting Koreans to prevent Japanese espionage is really funny. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2538.56s)]
*  Guys, guys. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2541.3599999999997s)]
*  That's a valid point, actually. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2541.9199999999996s)]
*  That's a good counterpoint. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2543.04s)]
*  How the fuck... [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2544.08s)]
*  You don't think we had a couple mistakes with the Japanese interment camps? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2545.12s)]
*  You don't think there was a Chinatown in some of those interment camps? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2548.96s)]
*  Also, if they're Japanese and said they're Korean, you're going to be like, OK. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2551.36s)]
*  But also, they sent them to a country, but they already have a country. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2555.1200000000003s)]
*  Like they could have sent them back to Korea. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2560.88s)]
*  You know, you're going to Kazakhstan. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2561.38s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2562.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2564.88s)]
*  Some of those deportation things are wild. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2565.84s)]
*  My buddy, Kristoff, you know Kristoff. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2567.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2568.56s)]
*  He had a funny joke where he's like, you think on the deportation flights, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2569.04s)]
*  when they send Mexican immigrants back to Mexico, the pilot still does an announcement? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2571.36s)]
*  It gets on my mind. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  Hey, guys, it's going to be kind of a bumpy flight going to Mexico City. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2579.12s)]
*  Better luck next time. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2582.64s)]
*  Like, do they do the safety thing? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2585.4399999999996s)]
*  It's just such a funny idea. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2587.52s)]
*  You got to get deported and you also have a middle seat. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2588.72s)]
*  You're like, fuck, dude. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2590.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, do we pay for the flight? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2592.24s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2593.7599999999998s)]
*  I think so. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2594.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2596.16s)]
*  And we just put them on like Spirit Air and we just sent them down there, I think. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2596.72s)]
*  Some people get first class. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2600.16s)]
*  Safe as airline right now. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2601.04s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2602.3999999999996s)]
*  That's true. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2602.9599999999996s)]
*  Have they not crashed at all? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2603.6s)]
*  No. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2604.8799999999997s)]
*  Delta keeps crashing, Doug. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2605.3799999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2607.04s)]
*  Delta keeps crashing. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2607.52s)]
*  They had one. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2608.56s)]
*  They had one. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2609.12s)]
*  They had another. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2610.4s)]
*  No, they had another. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2611.04s)]
*  It was diverted because it was on fire, smoking or something like that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2611.6s)]
*  That happens, bro. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2615.28s)]
*  I saw something that's probably fake. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2616.32s)]
*  I was thinking about switching, but I got... [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2619.36s)]
*  But apparently there's been less crashes this year than any other year in recent history. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2620.96s)]
*  It's just in the news. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2626.56s)]
*  Yeah, but there's a term for that. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2628.72s)]
*  It's a train derailment. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2630.16s)]
*  What is that? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2631.44s)]
*  Remember when in East Palestine, there was a train derailment and then the next like four months, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2632.0s)]
*  another train crashed, this train got vandalized, the robbery on a train. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2636.4s)]
*  And there's just all these train stories. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2639.92s)]
*  It's like, yeah, train stories are hot right now because this big one. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2641.44s)]
*  So let's just fill it up with train stories. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2643.92s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2645.28s)]
*  It was the same thing with migrant crime. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2646.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2648.56s)]
*  That was the big story. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2649.12s)]
*  So they were reporting every single time. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2650.08s)]
*  Here's what I'm saying. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2652.16s)]
*  Train derailment, pretty big story. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2653.44s)]
*  Migrant crime, that's like small things. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2654.96s)]
*  You can't really ignore... [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2656.8s)]
*  You can ignore a thousand migrant crimes and just say, you know what I mean? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2658.08s)]
*  But a fucking Delta flight flipping on its complete 180. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2661.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a big story. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  And if we're seeing more and more of those, then it's probably like, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2667.9199999999996s)]
*  it's never like they would under report that before. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2670.48s)]
*  That's always a story. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2672.64s)]
*  You know, every one of the pilots that have crashed is... [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2673.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2676.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2676.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2677.44s)]
*  Wait, Hong. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2678.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2678.56s)]
*  It is. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2680.16s)]
*  You want to finish the sentence? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2680.56s)]
*  If you could guess, what would it be? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2682.3999999999996s)]
*  Gay? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2685.52s)]
*  No? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2687.12s)]
*  Close. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2687.68s)]
*  He said the flight was flaming. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2689.04s)]
*  No, it's a female pilot. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2692.72s)]
*  I don't want to make a big deal about it because people have died, lost their lives. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2694.96s)]
*  But in the Toronto one, no one died. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2698.3199999999997s)]
*  So you can make fun of it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2699.92s)]
*  Female pilot also, though. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2700.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2702.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2703.68s)]
*  But it was also crosswind, right? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  So they say. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2706.56s)]
*  But what happened? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2707.2799999999997s)]
*  Apparently, she didn't land. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  She didn't adjust well enough. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2710.96s)]
*  She was trying to parallel park it or something? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2711.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2713.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2713.62s)]
*  I think she thought she saw an insect of some sort and then hit a fucking hard left and that shit just barrel rolled. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2715.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what I think happened. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2721.62s)]
*  I think it's hard for them to control their emotions in those moments. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2722.9s)]
*  And she freaked out. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2726.18s)]
*  That's my personal opinion. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2727.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2728.8199999999997s)]
*  You saw the video of all of them getting off the plane and the flight attendant grabbed the ass? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2729.06s)]
*  What? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2732.5s)]
*  You didn't see this? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2732.8199999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2733.54s)]
*  Let me pull this up. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2733.8599999999997s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2734.9s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2736.02s)]
*  You didn't see? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2736.58s)]
*  No. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2737.22s)]
*  Oh, there's a fire. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2737.54s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2738.2599999999998s)]
*  Let me look this up. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2738.9s)]
*  Grabbed whose ass? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2739.7799999999997s)]
*  The people coming off the plane. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2741.2999999999997s)]
*  So people are filing off. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2742.98s)]
*  They're like, everyone get off. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2744.02s)]
*  Leave your stuff. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2744.7400000000002s)]
*  Leave your stuff. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2745.22s)]
*  The flight attendant was like just palms. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2745.7s)]
*  I think it was a girl, but still just like palm that thing. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2747.46s)]
*  Dude, I was just going to switch to Delta. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2749.54s)]
*  Do I still do this? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2751.38s)]
*  No, Delta's fire. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2752.1s)]
*  I got no status with these guys. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2752.82s)]
*  You got to go Delta. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2754.02s)]
*  I got to start all over? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2754.58s)]
*  No, you got to go Delta. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2755.3s)]
*  And you'll be there. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2756.18s)]
*  You fly every single weekend. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2756.66s)]
*  You'll be there and fascinating. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2757.7s)]
*  But it's... [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2759.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2759.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2761.46s)]
*  You're also not looking for upgrades anyway, right? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2761.94s)]
*  Like you're buying yourself a first class ticket or whatever. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2764.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2767.38s)]
*  But I got that... [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2767.62s)]
*  But the high status is kind of nice. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2768.34s)]
*  They just hook you up. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2769.7s)]

*  Oh, no. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2776.82s)]
*  She's deep. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2777.3s)]
*  No, she got in the pole. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2777.86s)]
*  That was full on, right? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2778.98s)]
*  She waxed before that and everything. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2780.1800000000003s)]
*  She got fully caked up. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2781.62s)]
*  Oh. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2783.78s)]

*  Unnecessary. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2787.78s)]
*  I mean... [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2788.66s)]
*  IUD's readjusted. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2788.98s)]
*  Yeah, IUD is completely readjusted. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2790.1s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2792.7400000000002s)]

*  By that chick, I'm all right with it. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2797.46s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2800.66s)]
*  You didn't help us put our bags up when we boarded. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2801.14s)]
*  Now you're grabbing ass on the way out. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2802.9s)]
*  Now fucking Steve Smith Sr. is the flight attendant that we might have to go. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2804.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2808.1800000000003s)]
*  Now what's the deal, guys? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2808.42s)]
*  We had a lot of conversation on the internet about Doge. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2809.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2812.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2813.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2813.94s)]
*  Seems like some people are pretty upset about this Doge. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2815.62s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2819.06s)]

*  What was John Stewart saying? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2821.3s)]
*  Now, John had a fire piece. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2822.82s)]

*  What'd he say? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2829.78s)]
*  He's just saying like, if you want to start cutting places, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2830.6600000000003s)]
*  there's a lot of easier targets to cut. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2833.78s)]
*  If we got the piece, you could play the first 30 seconds. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2836.5s)]
*  But they might bang us on YouTube. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2839.1400000000003s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2841.86s)]
*  All right, so go. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2842.82s)]
*  What does he say? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2843.3s)]
*  Just like, hey, we can cut Pentagon defense spending. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2843.86s)]
*  We can cut all that. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2846.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2847.5400000000004s)]
*  We can stop giving... [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2847.94s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2849.0600000000004s)]
*  Hedge fund... [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2850.6600000000003s)]
*  No, no, it was the gas companies, like $3 billion in subsidies [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2851.46s)]
*  when they're already profitable by trillions of dollars. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2854.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2858.58s)]
*  You know, doing the thing that John always does, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2859.7799999999997s)]
*  which is like pointing out the most awesome things. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2861.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2864.2599999999998s)]
*  And yeah, he's just brilliant at it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2864.58s)]
*  So here's the frustration with Doge. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2868.18s)]
*  And we're having this talk about idiots too. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2871.06s)]
*  And it's a real bummer that this becomes such like a bipartisan conversation [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2874.42s)]
*  because... [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2878.66s)]
*  No, a partisan conversation because there is bipartisan support for it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2880.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2883.7s)]
*  Like, I feel like every single American is like, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2883.94s)]
*  yo, there's probably some government inefficiency. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2885.46s)]
*  No one really trusts the government that much anymore. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2887.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2890.42s)]
*  They either don't trust the Republicans, they don't trust the Democrats, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2890.66s)]
*  or they don't trust the institutions as a whole. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2892.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2895.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2895.8599999999997s)]
*  So this is the time in history to go get some of the bloat out of government. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2896.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2902.58s)]
*  Because we all seem to support it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2902.98s)]
*  Even Bernie Sanders is like, yo, I don't agree with Trump on everything, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2904.2599999999998s)]
*  but I do agree we should look into that Pentagon budget. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2906.9s)]
*  Why have they never been audited? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2909.7s)]
*  There is support here. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2911.46s)]
*  And because of the way that they're maybe going about it, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2913.7s)]
*  they're kind of... [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2917.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't even know if this has happened historically. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2918.82s)]
*  Charlamagne was pointing out that Clinton did it, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2921.1400000000003s)]
*  but he did it through government. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2922.98s)]
*  But because this guy who's this very polarizing figure, Elon, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2924.6600000000003s)]
*  is coming in and he's just seemingly hacking away [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2927.86s)]
*  at these different industries that are connected to government, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2931.38s)]
*  some people feel like without any real justification. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2936.34s)]
*  Like, I guess maybe they don't understand why he feels so confident [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2942.42s)]
*  that he can cut these jobs. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2945.54s)]
*  Is that the concern? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2947.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2948.42s)]
*  He's also hired a lot back. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2948.9s)]
*  And then some of them are hired back, which I think should happen. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2950.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's fine. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2952.98s)]
*  But I guess the tricky thing right here, I'm curious what you guys take on this, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2954.02s)]
*  is that there's all this support and because Elon is so polarizing, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2956.74s)]
*  I actually think it's going to be harder to execute something [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2961.38s)]
*  that Americans as a whole do want. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2964.2599999999998s)]
*  So this is one of those things where being antagonistic and polarizing, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2967.14s)]
*  being what Elon is, is actually hurting a very bipartisan supported effort, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2971.14s)]
*  which is to clean up government. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2976.9s)]
*  And I wonder if he can look at this and learn and go, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2978.34s)]
*  oh shit, I'm actually doing something that people want to do, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2981.38s)]
*  people want in a way that is going to make it harder. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2984.66s)]
*  Or do you think he just looks at it as a CEO and goes, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2988.9s)]
*  I'm cutting and I don't give a fuck what you're doing. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2992.1s)]
*  No matter. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2993.86s)]
*  And that's just going to piss people off. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2994.9s)]
*  But that's how he's done with every company. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2996.42s)]
*  But government is not a company. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=2998.42s)]
*  Twitter. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3000.42s)]
*  But go on, go on, go on. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3000.7400000000002s)]
*  That's why they got him for it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3001.62s)]
*  They're like, hey, you got to start treating the government like a company. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3003.06s)]
*  Which I don't disagree with in principle at all. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3005.7000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3008.98s)]
*  Because it's like these are government agencies that were put there to fix a problem. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3010.26s)]
*  It wasn't like, hey, this is just a profitable thing that we just have to do. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3015.46s)]
*  Our only concern is making profit. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3019.54s)]
*  Here's where I would say, and it may be a middle ground between what I'm saying [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3021.54s)]
*  and what you're saying. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3024.98s)]
*  If you are not driven in some fashion by some kind of bottom line, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3026.18s)]
*  there is going to be bloat. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3032.3399999999997s)]
*  Because there's no incentive for the government to ever lay off anyone. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3033.46s)]
*  And this is where I agree with what Vivek was saying. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3036.58s)]
*  The government bloats because you can't fire anybody. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3039.22s)]
*  Because why would you? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3041.7s)]
*  They're government employees. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3042.98s)]
*  They don't have to work hard. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3044.2599999999998s)]
*  They don't have to do anything. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3045.06s)]
*  The simple email this seemed to cause, and to me, I'm an idiot. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3046.18s)]
*  Simply asking what did you get done this week is a very easy thing. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  And if you have trouble with that email, to me, as an idiot, granted, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3055.06s)]
*  it seems like you didn't do anything this week, probably. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3060.26s)]
*  And your job is probably loseable. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3062.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3064.1s)]
*  And I look at that as like, yo, who the fuck are you? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3064.58s)]
*  I have people that I report to, heads of my agency. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3067.3s)]
*  They're the ones that I answer to. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3070.66s)]
*  I'm not answering to some motherfucker who just was granted this power unconstitutionally. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3072.18s)]
*  And now I have to just, I have to prove my worth to this guy? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3078.7400000000002s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3082.5s)]
*  I'm going to cut to the counterpoint. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3082.9s)]
*  I got this message from Jason yesterday at 1103 PM. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3084.9s)]
*  Guys, I don't recommend sending a Doge email to your wife to provide [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3091.38s)]
*  five bullet points of what they accomplished last week. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3095.46s)]
*  Jocelyn Jason, dude. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3101.78s)]
*  That's so good. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3103.62s)]
*  That's really good. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3105.2200000000003s)]
*  We should do that and just get the reaction. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3107.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3109.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3110.02s)]
*  You're holding that. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3111.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3112.42s)]
*  You're not doing that shit. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3113.78s)]
*  I'm going to drop it right now and just see. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3115.38s)]
*  And there's no context. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3116.9s)]
*  Let me, I'm going to ask. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3118.58s)]
*  Wait, how are you framing it? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3119.94s)]
*  I'm going to say, hey, can you send me just a five bullet point message of what [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3121.3s)]
*  we accomplished this last week? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3124.5s)]
*  No, I can't do it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3129.62s)]
*  Mine's going to come back with like a list of 20. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3130.34s)]
*  Everyone, everyone's going to come back with like a list of 20. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3131.78s)]
*  And she's going to be like, word. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3135.14s)]
*  I already told, I already told my wife what Jason texted the group. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3136.66s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3140.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3141.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3143.06s)]
*  Me too. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3144.42s)]
*  Me too. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3144.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3145.3799999999997s)]
*  She's listening in live now. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3146.1s)]
*  Jason put up the same message. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3147.22s)]
*  I wonder if that's even, I wonder if that's a real piece of change that he's trying to [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3148.66s)]
*  implement or that's just an antagonistic measure to rile up the base. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3153.94s)]
*  I don't care either way. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3159.62s)]
*  Send the fucking email. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3161.14s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3162.1s)]
*  To me, just send the email like, oh, I'm antagonized so I'm not going to report on what I did. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3162.9s)]
*  If you did something, send the email. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3168.18s)]
*  What does it do? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3170.18s)]
*  My question about it is like, what does it do? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3171.94s)]
*  It just puts them in a position where they're going to have to potentially lie. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3173.7s)]
*  I just don't know if it's effective. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3177.3799999999997s)]
*  Nobody's going to answer that email. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3178.66s)]
*  I've done nothing. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3180.18s)]
*  You should probably fire me next. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3181.06s)]
*  They're going to find bullshit that they did so we don't actually get to clean anything up. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3182.98s)]
*  And now you've got people bickering online over something we actually agree on. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3187.22s)]
*  Yeah, they're also going to use AI to like analyze it, I think, which that might be easy to trick. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3191.46s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3195.46s)]
*  Like, I think like they're like getting all these federal emails, like from thousands [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3196.1s)]
*  and thousands of people. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3198.98s)]
*  Two point five million federal employees. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3199.62s)]
*  So they're going to have AI like parse what people did and like the top performing people [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3202.02s)]
*  and the lower performing people. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3205.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3206.42s)]
*  And so that seems gamifiable to me. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3206.7400000000002s)]
*  Yo, I wonder if they went about this a little different. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3208.42s)]
*  Instead of doing it on a person to person basis, which these emails are, right? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3211.22s)]
*  Because that's when I start to have empathy for someone who's about to lose their job [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3216.98s)]
*  and now said, hey, provide for their family. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3220.42s)]
*  Right, and now I'm less supportive of these cutting measures that Doge is doing. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3222.1s)]
*  But rather analyze the different, I don't know what you would even call them. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3226.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, what would you call like, it's not a business department. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3231.22s)]
*  Yeah, analyze these departments for inefficiency as a whole. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3236.1s)]
*  Prove transparently to the American people that there is inefficiency there. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3240.74s)]
*  Like, I thought the most effective thing they did, and I don't even know if it's true, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3244.3399999999997s)]
*  is showed all the dead people that are still getting social security. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3246.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3250.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't even know if that's a real thing. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3250.66s)]
*  But if you could actually show proof that dead people were getting social security, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3252.1s)]
*  like people who've been dead 200 years still getting social security, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3255.78s)]
*  you have unanimous support from Americans who are like, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3258.42s)]
*  all right, well, cut that guy's social security. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3260.5s)]
*  He's been dead 200 years. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3262.1s)]
*  So start at the department, show the inefficiency, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3263.38s)]
*  and then you could pass it off to the senators or whoever you want [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3268.5s)]
*  to pass some sort of legislation to cut parts of that department. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3271.7s)]
*  But when you go person to person and judging off the email, they said, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3275.38s)]
*  now I start to feel like, well, shit, I had a lazy week last week, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3278.74s)]
*  but two weeks ago I was working overtime every single night, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3282.1s)]
*  and you didn't email me then? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3284.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3285.62s)]
*  But I think Elon's perspective, and he reposted this thing from Milton Friedman, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3286.02s)]
*  which is basically they just go through every department and he just says, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3289.22s)]
*  cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3292.58s)]
*  I think Milton Friedman had three that he wanted to keep. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3294.18s)]
*  It was like justice. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3296.3399999999997s)]
*  I forget, there was like two others, I don't even remember. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3298.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3300.3399999999997s)]
*  But everything else got to go to cut all of them. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3300.58s)]
*  So then why are you even emailing if you know what you got to cut? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3302.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that's what he's trying to do. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3305.54s)]
*  Trying to use that as proof to be like, yeah, all these got to go. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3306.74s)]
*  Oh, also, can we just do a little sports real quick? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3309.14s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3311.2999999999997s)]
*  Because this is a big, it's going to have, I guess already happened, but tonight, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3311.62s)]
*  Luca and the Lakers are playing Dallas, the Dallas Mavericks for the first time since Luca [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3315.7s)]
*  got traded. So I truly believe Luca will score 60. Like, not even a fucking question in my mind, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3320.18s)]
*  Luca score 60. I, whatever, if you want to put money on Luca over, take it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3326.5s)]
*  This guy, first of all, Lo's playing on nationally televised games. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3332.8199999999997s)]
*  He's keenly aware of when those moments are and he always plays better. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3336.1s)]
*  And he has an extra vendetta, like the Mavs traded this guy and then just said he was fat [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3340.42s)]
*  and lazy and out of shape. And he's going to be like, I will show you fat and lazy and out of shape. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3344.98s)]
*  And he had his first good game as a Laker on Friday. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3349.46s)]
*  Oh, so now he's. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3351.38s)]
*  Like 35, he had like 36, 18, some like some crazy stat line. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3351.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3355.7s)]
*  He's going to fucking destroy them. And I'm going to love it. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3355.7799999999997s)]
*  These guys are, these guys are insanely competitive. So obviously he's going to go for it. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3358.74s)]
*  Do you think that the Lakers support it? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3363.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3365.22s)]
*  Do you think the Lakers are going to feed them all night? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3365.38s)]
*  And I also think LeBron is such a, he's a battery in your back guy. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3367.06s)]
*  Like the difference between him and Jordan and you can side however you want, but Jordan was, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3371.06s)]
*  I'm going to take care of this guy. Kobe is an, I'm going to take care of this guy. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3375.1400000000003s)]
*  LeBron is, we're going to take care of this guy. I'm going to put the battery in your back to give [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3377.86s)]
*  you your best performance. I guarantee you LeBron's in his ear all week. Do you do whatever you got to [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3381.38s)]
*  do? This is your show. You're the best player. Telling him everything. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3386.26s)]
*  Is it in LA or Dallas? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3388.82s)]
*  It's going to be in LA. The Dallas one is April 9th. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3390.02s)]
*  That would be fun. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3392.02s)]
*  I want to go to that game. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3392.82s)]
*  Yeah, you should definitely. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3393.86s)]
*  I want to start a fucking Nico chant. How do you think Anthony Davis will go now? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3394.74s)]
*  Hurt? Probably in pain. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3398.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I've been seeing, I've been seeing. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3399.62s)]
*  Fucking Laker fans, idiots. Yo, I was going off on the trade and so many fucking idiot Lakers [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3401.2999999999997s)]
*  fans were like, you don't know what you got in Anthony Davis. The first game he got hurt, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3406.1s)]
*  quarter three. Putting it out of his mind for three quarters, Hurt might be a season ending injury. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3410.5s)]
*  And apparently there's rumors that it was an injury that the Mavs, like the team knew he had, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3415.14s)]
*  but they just pushed the trade through and forced it through. And then when they found out how bad [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3420.02s)]
*  it was, they didn't do an adequate physical. There's a rumor they tried to get the trade [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3424.26s)]
*  rescinded, but everybody had already played games and it was too late. Oh, wow. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3427.5400000000004s)]

*  bonus. Let's get back to the show. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3512.02s)]
*  Pretty much going to every department and just firing everyone that's on probation. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3513.3s)]
*  Because those are the ones you can get away with firing because they're not, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3517.46s)]
*  you know, their job isn't actually finalized yet. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3520.58s)]
*  Got it. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3523.22s)]
*  And it's like even that it's like, all right, so now all this young crop of people who are [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3523.62s)]
*  probably qualified because if they got hired in the first place, now you're just getting rid [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3528.02s)]
*  of all that. And now you're going to have just a bunch of old people who've been doing it the [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3533.3s)]
*  old way all this time. It's like, where's the change? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3536.9s)]
*  Like you're going to just have the same thing going on and I don't know that that's necessarily [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3539.38s)]
*  true because usually what they do is they fire the old people because they make way more money. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3544.34s)]
*  Yeah, but they're firing all of their people on probation. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3548.58s)]
*  But why would the young people be on probation? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3551.3s)]
*  To clarify, it's not a punishment probation. It's a probationary hiring period. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3553.14s)]
*  So maybe what they're doing is maybe the thought behind it is, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3558.26s)]
*  hey, these people aren't even officially hired. And if we know that these departments have a lot [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3561.62s)]
*  of bloat, why would we fire the people that have been working there for decades? And that's where [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3565.54s)]
*  they've committed their life to. Why don't we lay off the people who haven't even started? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3569.14s)]
*  And then eventually they're going to start cutting some of the bloat as well. I do think [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3573.3s)]
*  it's a multi-step process. I do think I'm okay with overcutting government right now because [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3576.34s)]
*  I know what will happen over time is things get added and added and bloated again. So it's just [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3581.54s)]
*  like, let's cut as much as we can now. And I'm sure over time. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3586.02s)]
*  That's a good point because this is not like a one-time fix. You're going to have to do this [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3589.14s)]
*  every single fucking year until the end of the country. And unfortunately, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3593.3s)]
*  probably we're at a point where we're so bloated that we're going to need some pretty drastic cuts. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3598.34s)]
*  I was in California this weekend. Weather's obviously fucking awesome, all of that, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3604.26s)]
*  but you're like, oh, you're taxing us at 51% if you're in the top income bracket, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3607.6200000000003s)]
*  but homelessness is still a rampant issue. Education didn't seem to be very good. Public [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3612.02s)]
*  school system doesn't be good. And I'm not saying taxes never work and not taxing always works at [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3615.94s)]
*  all. But you have to accept that that money seems to be getting used inefficiently, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3620.58s)]
*  at least in the states that get taxed the highest. So why not cut those budgets down, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3625.94s)]
*  see if the money can get used efficiently. At the very least, we're not wasting our tax money. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3630.5s)]
*  I talked to an FBI guy recently and I was asking about like Cash Mattel and shutting down the [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3634.58s)]
*  Hoover Building, all this stuff. He's like, you shouldn't shut it down. But he's like, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3638.1s)]
*  there is so much bureaucracy and bloat within the FBI that you just have people that have been there [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3640.58s)]
*  for 20 years that haven't done a case in like three decades or they've been there for their whole life, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3645.38s)]
*  haven't done a case in three decades, and they don't know what's going on. They get more risk [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3650.1s)]
*  averse over time. So like, he's like, when I started, I was getting assigned on all these jobs, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3653.2999999999997s)]
*  we were getting all these different cartels, we were getting all these different organized crime [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3656.98s)]
*  things. And now I'm trying to get assigned to stuff. And they're like, ah, it's too risky, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3659.86s)]
*  don't do it. And he's like, but my job is to go in and infiltrate and get these gangs. So like, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3663.22s)]
*  what is my purpose? And like slowly he was getting pulled back and put on more easier jobs, like [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3668.02s)]
*  busting buys and like little crack things. And he was like, this is a waste of time. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3672.3399999999997s)]
*  So they're getting more risk averse, they're getting more comfortable in their positions. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3675.94s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, you do need to get rid of a lot of people. I wonder if that has to do with [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3679.54s)]
*  the like the reward matrix. Like with, you know, cops, I think in the city, there's a quota to the [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3683.06s)]
*  amount of like tickets they have to give out. So you could go and find the really egregious things [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3688.34s)]
*  and go give them a ticket, or you could wait in like a dark side street of a place where you know, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3695.54s)]
*  guys do like drag racing a lot. Yeah, and then clip them every Friday night when they're drag [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3704.34s)]
*  racing. Yeah, like I wonder if you just gravitate towards the easiest things, which is the risk of [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3709.46s)]
*  our situation. But when the FBI, the thing that's going to probably help the country the most is [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3713.38s)]
*  when you're going out the most dangerous. So now you're clipping this low level bullshit that isn't [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3718.0200000000004s)]
*  really helping every every day person, just so you can meet your quota. So maybe you need to [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3722.26s)]
*  restructure the reward. Yeah. And again, multi step process. I think this is step one, I don't think [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3727.3s)]
*  this is the perfect solution. I just like actionable steps being taken. I just wish they, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3732.34s)]
*  because I like the fact that somebody from outside is coming in to make these changes, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3738.42s)]
*  because I don't think people from within, we can't actually, hey, how can we take money away from [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3742.7400000000002s)]
*  you? And how can we fire your people? They're not gonna. And if you if you were gonna change it, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3748.9s)]
*  you would have already done exactly. Yeah. But I think they should work alongside. So you have [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3752.42s)]
*  Elon working alongside with some of these department heads and things like that. And now it's like, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3756.7400000000002s)]
*  okay, he's like, what does the department do? What like, what is this money for? Like, you have [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3761.14s)]
*  to do a bit more surgical cuts than the way that they're doing it right now. Because you saw they [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3765.8599999999997s)]
*  fired people that were in charge of fucking the nuclear warheads and shit like that had to hire [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3769.7s)]
*  them back. And like, that could have been a crazy mistake. Like, I know, I get what he's saying, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3773.94s)]
*  like, there is risk to the overfire, especially in certain sectors. I agree. I just I don't [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3782.9s)]
*  necessarily think that risk is as like, I don't think the risk is so catastrophic. I think [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3787.78s)]
*  potentially firing these guys, we're not we're not gonna be like, oh shit, a nuke got fired. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3793.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, it's just we're not firing the guys that are but that could have happened. I don't I think [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3797.1400000000003s)]
*  that's a bit hyperbolic. That's all I'm saying. Also, you can hire them back. It's not like they [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3801.1400000000003s)]
*  can work for like the nuke place down the block. Yeah, but they're the new guys. Yeah, but we just [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3804.34s)]
*  don't know how much like other countries are targeting that thing. Like, say if there's one [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3809.3s)]
*  person who's like, cybersecurity, protecting other countries from accessing our nukes, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3812.98s)]
*  and now we were just like with no security there for like a day or two. I mean, if I was the one [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3819.22s)]
*  time boom, they got in. If I'm like any of our ops, I'm trying to get a spy into Doge. And I'm [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3823.62s)]
*  trying to get them to push cuts in certain sectors that would be advantageous for me as the opposition. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3831.46s)]
*  So I want them to cut defense spending. I want them to cut any sort of like security apparatus. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3839.46s)]
*  Maybe it's a nuclear program. I would want them to cut development programs in AI or these other [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3847.2200000000003s)]
*  technological things that are really going to put America ahead of every other country in the world. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3852.5s)]
*  Now, I'm sure there are certain measures that are, you know, put in place to like stop that from [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3856.98s)]
*  happening. But that's kind of how I'm thinking about this is like a once in a lifetime opportunity [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3861.38s)]
*  if you're another country, bro, the way these other countries do this is so wild. I was [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3865.3s)]
*  reading the story I was talking to this FBI guy and he was telling me this thing that he infiltrated [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3869.38s)]
*  that they had. There's a guy that's one of like the top neo-Nazis on Twitter. And he has like a [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3872.58s)]
*  bunch of Twitter accounts and he's just putting like all this racist bullshit. What's his name? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3878.42s)]
*  Ronaldo Nazario is putting all this like super racist shit. He just runs like hate pages. He's [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3881.78s)]
*  like the Jews do this, black people do this, da da da. Look at this crime. We got to make America [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3887.06s)]
*  white. He's like a white supremacist. He lives in St. Petersburg. Russia or Florida? In Russia. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3890.42s)]
*  That's important. And yeah, he's in Russia. Apparently he's like a teacher that teaches [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3897.06s)]
*  English but is getting paid. Like apparently someone like audited his bank account, like hacked [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3901.1400000000003s)]
*  into his bank. He's getting paid like millions of dollars to be like an English teacher, allegedly. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3904.34s)]
*  And he's pumping all this neo-Nazi shit, creating neo-Nazis in America, aggregating all these like [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3908.42s)]
*  incel kids. And then basically from St. Petersburg in Russia is like convincing them to do domestic [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3912.6600000000003s)]
*  terrorism. And like they're literally putting in spies, like domestic terrorists infiltrating, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3917.86s)]
*  getting them riled up, somehow getting them money in some cases, aggregating all of them, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3924.18s)]
*  getting them like training techniques, sending them like field manuals from the Marines and shit, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3928.5s)]
*  and basically like promoting them to do acts of terrorism. And half of these idiots don't even, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3932.18s)]
*  no, I bet 99% of these idiots don't even realize they're being manipulated. They actually think [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3937.7s)]
*  they're fighting a good fight. They're like this guy's on point. He's got all the real research. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3941.7s)]
*  I'm going to go and do my YouTube, my Googling to find out why this is all justified. And you [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3945.06s)]
*  can find justification for anything. I mean, their motherfuckers believe the earth is flat. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3950.98s)]
*  So they are out there thinking they're doing the Lord's work when they're doing Putin's. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3955.54s)]
*  Crazy. And then they're setting up like, yo, we're going to shoot up this thing. We're going to try [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3958.82s)]
*  to free this guy from prison. We're going to go kill this family because they're communists. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3963.14s)]
*  And they're literally plotting all the shit, buying all the equipment. And this FBI guy [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3966.42s)]
*  infiltrated them to take them out. There's a guy, I forget his name, but he was bragging about [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3969.62s)]
*  how he was like one of the most viewed people on Twitter, right? And a lot of his shit is just like [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3974.1s)]
*  the Jews do this, the Jews do that. And they probably do, but that's what his Twitter is. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3979.54s)]
*  And he was talking about it. He was like, yeah, I was one of the most viewed on Twitter. And I [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3985.22s)]
*  wonder if he even realized that those views might be amplified by our opposition. They want that [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3988.18s)]
*  unrest in America. This is perfect. And he's out there going, nah, the people really understand [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3993.62s)]
*  what I'm saying. They really care about what I'm saying. It's like, no, Russia does, China does. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=3998.34s)]
*  They don't even give a fuck about the Jews or not. It could be anybody. It could be Black Lives [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4002.18s)]
*  Matter. I'm sure that they were pumping the exact same people. They were shitting all over Black [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4005.3s)]

*  whatever. Let me throw this hand up. You see what I'm saying? Like to Shultz's point, I need [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4564.42s)]
*  attention. I'm starved for attention. I'm not getting it any other way because I'm not good [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4568.5s)]
*  enough at what I do. So I have to reach for this low hanging fruit. Bannon just wants attention. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4572.74s)]
*  There you go. It's also worth those. And like, even the guy I was talking to, he's like the white, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4577.62s)]
*  the neo-Nazi shit, he's like, there's maybe like a couple thousand. It's like, it's not like this [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4580.9s)]
*  rampant thing. Not all Republicans are neo-Nazis. Like not all of them. No, of course not. The vast [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4584.42s)]
*  majority probably. All groups start small and then they keep going. Right. So it's like, that's the [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4588.58s)]
*  shit. I don't want people to get comfortable with that. Miles, tell us about your people. Go. No, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4593.139999999999s)]
*  I just also think the fear is that like, these are people that are very close to Trump. They're, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4598.98s)]
*  even if they're a small group, they're this Steve Bannon was his former like chief strategist. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4602.98s)]
*  He's at the largest political activist group for conservatives. Like, you know, that's valid. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4611.219999999999s)]
*  That's valid. Yeah. They're in position. Even if they're not within the cabinet, they're within [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4616.9s)]
*  pretty high positions within this. I think that's the fear people are having. Yeah. And [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4621.62s)]
*  you normalize that shit. But a lot of these neo-Nazis hate Trump. Like they hate Republicans. They [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4625.54s)]
*  hate America because America is like funding. Now, the point is just in general. Trump or Kamala. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4629.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That's what's interesting. So this guy was saying that a lot of them voted for Hillary. They [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4633.86s)]
*  voted for Kamala because they're accelerationists. They're like, if we vote for Hillary, the whole [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4637.62s)]
*  country will get destroyed. The border will be open. Police will be defunded. And then that'll [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4640.58s)]
*  lead us to our ultimate D-Day, which is when white people control the world. I think you're arguing [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4643.86s)]
*  different things too. I think you're arguing that true neo-Nazis and what they believe and feel is [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4647.299999999999s)]
*  one thing. And I think Alex is saying making it normal, making it okay to just throw up a Nazi [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4651.94s)]
*  salute will move people toward being more okay with racism. Correct? Yes. And you take away from [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4657.379999999999s)]
*  the actual criticism. Like you should be able to criticize Israel like every other country in the [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4664.0199999999995s)]
*  world. Like we criticize Canada left and right. We can't criticize Israel. Like literally all of us [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4668.339999999999s)]
*  called Justin Trudeau a cuck every single day for like three years straight. We can't talk about [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4673.86s)]
*  fucking Bibi Netanyahu. Of course we can. But then sometimes Jewish people tie it in if you [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4680.5s)]
*  criticize Israel then it's like, oh, that's anti-Semitic. Which is unfair. But when you [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4684.9800000000005s)]
*  throw a fucking Nazi salute up, now it gives them credence to thinking that it's anti-Semitism. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4689.3s)]
*  They have their ammo to go look at that. If you guys don't do that, if you're just like, yo, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4693.78s)]
*  that guy who runs a country is a piece of shit. Yeah. Or call him gay. Like we did Justin Trudeau. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4698.26s)]
*  That's really effective. Nobody's tried that with him. Question is sexuality. Justin Trudeau had to [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4703.78s)]
*  step down. That's facts. That's true. But then how come you're at this conservative convention and [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4708.42s)]
*  no one is... We don't know if no one's pushing back. There are people that... Barely. I don't see Fox [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4714.58s)]
*  News saying, oh, that was so wrong of him doing that. I don't watch enough Fox to know. I don't [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4720.1s)]
*  watch enough Fox to know. We don't hear it in the zeitgeist. Yeah. Like Trump should be coming out, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4724.58s)]
*  yo, I don't agree with that. The fact that Trump would never do that. But to your point, the zeitgeist [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4728.82s)]
*  doesn't seem to be like... We didn't even know about that. The zeitgeist doesn't seem like, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4733.3s)]
*  what the fuck is this guy doing at the CPAC? Also, there's so many people that like... This is the [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4736.5s)]
*  other thing, and I will defend politicians even on both sides. And this is like, you don't have to [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4740.74s)]
*  come out against every single thing that someone within your party does. It's not up to the leader [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4744.34s)]
*  of the Democratic party to talk about the fringe senator that says there's 67 genders and be like, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4749.62s)]
*  I don't believe in that. Which to be honest is just as like annoying to the American voter. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4754.74s)]
*  It might be advantageous to do that for the Democrats to call him out, but it's not up to [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4762.34s)]
*  Kamala, whoever the fuck is out there for every single senator that opens their mouth or every [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4766.66s)]
*  single local congressman that opens their mouth and says some goofy shit to be like, I disavow, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4770.5s)]
*  I disavow. You could be disavowing all day. I get it. This is Steve Bannon at CPAC. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4774.900000000001s)]
*  He's kicked out. For me, I'm like, if I'm part of Trump's squad, I'm like, yo, we kicked that [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4778.42s)]
*  goofy motherfucker out. He's just trying to get attention. Even now. I don't know why you let [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4782.1s)]
*  him on stage. You say that. But the fact that you say it quiet, it's like... I don't think Trump's [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4784.900000000001s)]
*  got to say anything necessarily. I think Al's point does hold some credence or whatever [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4789.22s)]
*  credibility though, and that it doesn't seem to be... Nobody says we're reacting, which is a little [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4793.54s)]
*  crazy. Nobody, there's no tweets that we're seeing. There's no nothing. There's no stories. I don't [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4797.46s)]
*  think Trump has to acknowledge everything. I think we put that on him. I don't say everything. I think [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4802.26s)]
*  that's at a level that needs to be acknowledged. I'm like, there's people who take shots at us [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4806.02s)]
*  sometimes or say crazy and we're like, we're not even giving them oxygen. That's true. But I think [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4811.22s)]
*  the fact that nobody's saying anything is a little weird. I think Bannon's below the level of react [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4816.5s)]
*  to. He's just a citizen at this point. He's not even part of government. If he's influential in [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4820.82s)]
*  this... What is it called? C-PAC. It's C-PAC? Yeah. If he's influential in C-PAC, if he actually is, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4825.38s)]
*  or if he's just a speaker that's up there, I think that's where you decide. If he's actually [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4832.02s)]
*  influencing where the money goes, because if the money starts getting clipped, then maybe Trump [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4835.7s)]
*  starts to speak up. But at the same time, there's no way Steve Bannon's going to say something and [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4840.74s)]
*  then they're going to stop funneling money into Trump's agenda. Fuck no. Conservatives are running [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4844.66s)]
*  everything right now. If anything, they should be telling Bannon, yo, can you shut the fuck up? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4848.74s)]
*  We're actually doing some good work right now. We have everything under control. You're going to [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4852.66s)]
*  fuck this whole thing up and make everything radioactive because that's the only way you know [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4856.18s)]
*  how to get attention. The Bannon is the type of guy, the only way he knows how to get attention [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4859.22s)]
*  is just make it radioactive. There are certain people that can get attention from art. There's [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4863.0599999999995s)]
*  certain people who get attention from creativity. There's certain people who can get attention [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4866.74s)]
*  from literally understanding what's going on and delivering the facts in a fun and knowledgeable [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4870.900000000001s)]
*  way. That's a Jon Stewart. I don't think anybody goes, oh, he's just biased. He's trying to [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4876.820000000001s)]
*  manipulate people when Jon talks. We trust him. But the Bannon is just, how do I be radioactive? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4881.780000000001s)]
*  If I throw this up, I'll do it. It's like wrestling to him. I literally think he's up there and he's [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4887.620000000001s)]
*  just going- So they're looking at him like Kanye? Kanye is what I was thinking. I can't tell you what [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4891.620000000001s)]
*  they are. That's what I look at him as. I'm like, I don't take that guy seriously. But if you take [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4895.700000000001s)]
*  C-PAC seriously, I don't think you have him speak. This is the largest conference. This is their big [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4899.14s)]
*  conference. Yeah, no, no. I think that you got to look at it and you got to be like, what the fuck? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4902.58s)]
*  And I think you got to have some maybe behind the scenes talk. But if he comes out and talks about [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4906.740000000001s)]
*  it publicly, what do you think Bannon's going to do with that? Bannon's going to use that as oxygen. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4910.740000000001s)]
*  He's going to light it up even further. Yeah, that's fair. He's going to say, this guy Trump [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4915.62s)]
*  is defending a migrant over me who actually cares about America. I think giving him any oxygen is [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4920.660000000001s)]
*  going to divide the party even further. And this is what fucking happens every single time. You get [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4927.38s)]
*  in power, you have an agenda, you're ready to go. And then some motherfucking egotistical narcissist [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4931.7s)]
*  that has no ability to execute anything- Parasite. Yeah, exactly. Comes in and for their own- [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4937.78s)]
*  Who are we talking about? Elon or Bannon? Which one? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4943.54s)]
*  What's it got to be? Elon is the bank. You know what I mean? He don't have to parasite. I mean, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4946.82s)]
*  he gave what? 240 mil to me. 270. To make two bills. So he's [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4953.46s)]
*  seeping. He's getting some returns. Oh no, 100%. You can call that parasiting as well. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4961.06s)]
*  I don't love the turn Elon has taken in general in terms of everything being a fucking conservative [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4966.9s)]
*  talking point and the South African genocide of white people. He said it was the biggest issue [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4970.9s)]
*  in our lifetime. And it's like, you were alive when South Africa was actually apartheid, right? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4975.78s)]
*  That wasn't- I don't think it's the biggest. Genocide in Rwanda. It's like watching him [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4981.22s)]
*  parrot these Republican talking points is also nauseating. You're smart enough to have an opinion [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4985.94s)]
*  on your own. So that's my criticism of Elon. I don't look at him the same way I look at Steve [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4990.0199999999995s)]
*  Bannon. And it does suck because I really used to be an Elon guy. I'm still an Elon guy. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=4995.38s)]
*  With everything he's been doing lately, it's hard for him. I don't mind the art from the artist. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5001.54s)]
*  Oh, I mean if I can listen to him, I'm gonna throw him on my truck. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5006.1s)]
*  Are you afraid your shit's gonna get vandalized? Have you seen that? Yo, I had a dude throw a [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5011.46s)]
*  fucking snowball at the car. All right, that could've been- That's not bad at all. That could've [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5015.46s)]
*  been because you're black. Yeah, it was just New York. Nah, but they wouldn't do that to any regular [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5018.74s)]
*  crowd. That was some cucky shit to come out. That was unbelievable. Are you from New York or not? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5022.42s)]
*  Do that! Do that and don't talk about it on the podcast. He was in a group, boy. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5028.58s)]
*  But that's gonna come with it. That's what I'm saying. I think the car being a cyber truck had [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5035.62s)]
*  something to do with the reason why they did it. Absolutely. It's an attention-seeking car. Not [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5041.7s)]
*  saying that that's what you want it for. There are other things. You've always loved Teslas. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5045.3s)]
*  I think they're throwing the snowball because it's Elon. It could be Elon, but it's also- [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5048.58s)]
*  Even if it wasn't Elon, even if somebody else owned it, it's such a different looking car [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5053.54s)]

*  there's a moment and you have a snowball in your hand. There's a moment you go, you know what? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5066.02s)]
*  Fuck that car. I keep that. I keep that. Nah, it's not far. Yeah, I drive with that. What you [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5069.06s)]
*  doing? Making me more proud of my car? I think that is the biggest thing most people feel is [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5074.9800000000005s)]
*  they're like, all right, we're changing the Gulf of Mexico. We're cutting all these things. All [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5078.9s)]
*  right, but things are still expensive. I think that's how most people feel. My day-to-day has [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5082.1s)]
*  not improved. We're doing all this stuff. That's cool. But I'm wondering if they're having buyers [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5086.26s)]
*  remorse yet. I don't think so. I think there's so much excitement. It's too early. And what has [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5090.34s)]
*  been achieved? And you have to understand, there are a lot of people that agree with what Trump and [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5094.98s)]
*  Elon are trying to do. There's a lot of people. There's a lot of support behind it. Matter of [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5099.54s)]
*  fact, we support it. We support it. We're all sitting here going, yeah, we have to cut the [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5104.82s)]
*  bloating government. The way that they're doing it, we have to see. Is that bad? My feeling in [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5110.099999999999s)]
*  general is just like, let's just see what happens. No, I agree. I think we're all there. I'm glad you [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5116.5s)]
*  said that. There's a lot of liberal people that get very upset about this topic. They get very [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5122.9s)]
*  upset about Elon and what's happening. It's unconstitutional. Charlemagne was talking about [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5129.299999999999s)]
*  that. And you have a lot of liberal politicians, liberal pundits talking about it as well. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5132.74s)]
*  And I think the important thing to reflect on as well, I'm not saying don't talk about that, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5137.78s)]
*  but the other thing to reflect on as well is we are so disillusioned with government [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5141.7s)]
*  and American institutions that we are willing to just see. Do you know how desperate you got to be [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5146.42s)]
*  as a country where you're willing to just go, all right, let's try this. If things were good for [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5154.0199999999995s)]
*  people, you would go, I don't want to risk it. My life is pretty good. I'm concerned if we do this, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5160.099999999999s)]
*  my life could get worse. You know how many people got to be in a place where they're like, it can't [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5166.0199999999995s)]
*  get much worse to go, let's see. Which I can understand the counterpoint. I'm sure there's [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5169.94s)]
*  people at the end of the Weimar Republic that was like, yeah, let's just see. Let's just see [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5174.9s)]
*  what's going on. And then by the time you see that it's bad, it's too late. Weimar Republic is what [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5178.66s)]
*  the end of right before Hitler takes over. So I can see people being like, oh, yeah, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5183.46s)]
*  let's just wait and see. And then after you see all this shit is fucked up, it's too late. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5187.219999999999s)]
*  So I can see the concern. Some of the fear. Sorry, I'm listening to some of these history [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5189.94s)]
*  podcasts now because sports has broken my heart and I'm looking for things to do. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5194.9s)]
*  But when you hear about Caesar or Genghis Khan or whatever and people are like, oh, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5197.94s)]
*  this all right. Trump is doing the same things. I do see how some of the things you're like, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5202.66s)]
*  it reminds you of what's happening. I don't think that's what's going to happen. But I [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5207.139999999999s)]
*  understand the fear for Doge. I would say this is the first time we have heard and seen any [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5210.5s)]
*  politician that's president take actionable steps that as far as I know, to reduce government [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5216.34s)]
*  spending. Clinton did it and I was too young to understand it probably. They fired 300,000 [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5221.0599999999995s)]
*  government workers under Clinton, but he did it with bipartisan support. So he did it through [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5227.38s)]
*  government. And I think that was the big difference maker. And during Clinton, it was the first time [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5232.74s)]
*  in all of our lifetimes. Budget surplus, right? We had a surplus. Which would be nice. That would [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5237.78s)]
*  be really fucking nice. I think Americans are so detached from our national debt. We're like, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5243.22s)]
*  that shit ain't mine. That's the nation's debt. We're so detached that the only thing we think [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5247.78s)]
*  about is the repercussions of that debt, which might be the super inflation, the cost of goods [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5253.3s)]
*  being crazy, interest wild. But we got to knock that down to knock the rest of this down. I think [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5259.22s)]
*  if you knock the debt down, mortgage rates come down. Mortgage rates come down. The liquidity is [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5266.34s)]
*  out there. There's more money on the streets. Better for everybody. So my feeling is like, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5270.18s)]
*  where I see the difference when people are like, oh, like Julie Caesar, Hitler, da da da. I'm like, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5274.18s)]
*  my hope is that the checks and balances within the US government will be strong enough that if [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5277.78s)]
*  something goes too far, like Trump's like, yo, I'm dictator for life, that the checks will stop. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5282.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I mean. And I think that's the difference between where we are now and where we [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5285.7s)]
*  have been historically. And so that's my hope. And that's why I'm kind of a little more comfortable [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5288.9800000000005s)]
*  being like, yeah, let's just kind of see what happens. I think where, or go out, go out. I think [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5291.78s)]
*  it's like, I agree with you, but I think it's also important to point out shit while it's happening. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5294.900000000001s)]
*  Very fair. Very fair. Because like, if you just stay quiet and just let them do it, and then it [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5300.820000000001s)]
*  might hit that point where it's- That's its own check and balance. Y'all saying things. First of [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5304.26s)]
*  all, since when do we push back on people checking the government? Like, that's the most American [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5309.38s)]
*  thing to do. But if it's the way they talk, it's like- No, no, what I'm saying is- You want to [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5319.14s)]
*  listen to what I say, you out of here. No, of course, of course. Which is very un-American. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5323.86s)]
*  I think Americans will reject that. But what I'm trying to say is, right now you have people [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5328.18s)]
*  pushing back to what they believe is government overreach, right? That is happening from the left [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5332.98s)]
*  to the right because the right is in power. There was a time where the right was pushing [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5339.7s)]
*  back against left government overreach during COVID. Everybody go in your house, you got to take the [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5345.54s)]
*  jab, et cetera. We got to stop acting like we don't appreciate pushing back against government. It's [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5349.459999999999s)]
*  part of our nation's identity. Anytime we think that you're pushing a little too far, you're getting [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5355.299999999999s)]
*  in my pockets, you're getting in my house, we push back. So on a fundamental level, even if you're on [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5359.7s)]
*  the right, you should appreciate the left going, hey, government, back the fuck up, chill out. Now, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5365.54s)]
*  there's a part of you, if you're on the right, that goes, where the fuck was this energy when [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5371.62s)]
*  they were shoving shit in our arm that they don't know what the fuck it is? But if you can step back [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5374.66s)]
*  for a second and be like, all right, maybe I don't agree with them, but I do, I respect their right to [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5378.82s)]
*  voice their opinion on this. And I fundamentally agree with them pushing back against government [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5384.5s)]
*  overreach. But there is something you can connect on there. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5388.66s)]
*  then when you have the top down person saying, if you don't do what the fuck I say, you're [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5393.139999999999s)]
*  wait till midterms, you're out of here, or you're getting fired. They're creating the climate where [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5398.099999999999s)]
*  it's like, I don't want any talk back and I don't want anybody doing anything I don't say. Wait till [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5403.7s)]
*  midterms is, I think that's an important thing to distinguish. Wait till midterms is your base is [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5408.74s)]
*  going to reject you because this is what your base wants. It's not, well, Trump can't kick some, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5415.54s)]
*  if he, if Trump was kicking out a, the Senator of Maine or the governor of Maine or whatever the [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5420.26s)]
*  fuck it was, he would just do it now. He doesn't have to wait till midterms. They can just fund [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5423.78s)]
*  having somebody run against you and kick you the fuck out of it. Okay. That's politics. Like, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5429.62s)]
*  why would they not fund them already? But it's, so I think every elected official should speak for [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5434.18s)]
*  their constituents. It shouldn't be, Hey, you just have to follow what daddy says. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5442.18s)]
*  Well, that's what they all do. That's what the whip is. That's what Nancy Pelosi does. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5447.860000000001s)]
*  That's where the elected officials have to speak for the people. Cause if they do, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5452.42s)]
*  it doesn't matter how much money you throw against them. If you're actually speaking for your people [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5456.58s)]
*  and what they want, you will win. Trump got less money. Trump got way less money. Do you know how [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5460.42s)]
*  much money they threw at the people going up against Trump? Kamala got the, what's the record? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5464.58s)]
*  To the point that we all thought she might actually win just because of money. It didn't matter. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5469.780000000001s)]
*  So now we're, now we're in a situation where it's, you're going to basically [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5474.34s)]
*  force government officials to actually care what their people want, not what the special [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5478.5s)]
*  interest groups want. And if they're riding with these special interest groups, all of a sudden [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5483.3s)]
*  the Trump administration is going to go, it's interesting that they're really influenced by [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5488.1s)]
*  those big money donors. And they're not caring about what you really care about, which is the [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5491.700000000001s)]
*  cost of eggs and the inflation and the bloating government. That's what we're going to care about. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5495.62s)]
*  And this is our guy and he's going to fix that for you. That's on you as a politician for not [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5499.78s)]
*  knowing what your people want. And calling back to the Clinton thing, this is another reason, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5505.22s)]
*  even though I find him politically very fucking corny now, Elon, I don't have a problem with Doge. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5509.62s)]
*  Clinton was 32 years ago. Like when we were, we were 90s kids. How far back was the 60s in our [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5513.62s)]
*  brain? That's now, that's the 90s now. You know what I mean? Like it's eight fucking elections. 32 [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5519.62s)]
*  years. We just let it grow and grow and grow and grow. It's 32 years of bloat. We got to take it out. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5525.78s)]
*  And again, I'm not even just saying it cause he's Indian. It's part helps, but like Vivek being like, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5531.78s)]
*  Hey, this needs to get cut. It clicked with me with like, yeah, I didn't even know Clinton did it, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5536.18s)]
*  but there's 32 years of bloat that just needs to get cut and we will overcorrect. And I'm okay there. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5539.7s)]
*  Now Vivek's plan was to do it using the constitution. Yes, which I prefer. I think that [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5546.1s)]
*  probably would have been more digestible for the average, like a politically inclined American, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5551.54s)]
*  because they couldn't really reject the constitution. Yeah. I think Vivek, I think [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5557.38s)]
*  it's quicker to do it this way. Yeah. It's quicker to do it the way Elon. Yeah. And there's a risky [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5562.42s)]
*  strategy though. Because if it bombs, the Democrats are going to win the next four elections. Yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5568.9800000000005s)]
*  So you got to hope that the first thing you do just like slaps. I think Trump sided with the money [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5574.34s)]
*  with Elon and I think they pushed the wrong guy out. That's personally what I feel. With Vivek. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5578.42s)]
*  Yeah. I think Vivek would have, it would have, and it would have overcorrected for sure, but like by [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5583.22s)]
*  the constitution, can't really argue with it. It's going to be some uproar, but we'll cut some muscle. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5587.06s)]
*  I love Vivek, but it's hard to go up against the rock. Of course, of course, of course. It's just so, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5591.860000000001s)]
*  he's so impressive. You're like, richest man in the world. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, if, if we had to [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5597.62s)]
*  hire, I'm trying to think of a job I wouldn't hire Elon for. I wouldn't hire him to watch my kids. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5603.94s)]
*  You see the clip of him forgetting his kid at the perspective thing. Just straight walking off, baby. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5615.139999999999s)]
*  Son, Kim Kardashian done that shit. Oh, okay. Okay. Great mother of the year. Kim Kardashian [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5620.5s)]
*  has done that. There you go. There you go. All right. I wouldn't have him take your job. I think [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5627.54s)]
*  I made the pod worse. Here he is. This shit will get views though. If he was on here every single week. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5631.3s)]
*  So he did the Laugh This Kid, bro. Pull it up. This shit is so funny. He's busy, bro. He's trying to cut, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5635.62s)]
*  he's trying to cut. He's like, I got 13 of these little motherfuckers. Yeah, he's trying to make [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5641.46s)]
*  more of them. That is wow. Look at the kid. Look how far back the kid is, dog. Now people did post [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5646.5s)]
*  the full video where like, he's like, come on little buddy, let's go. And he's like, and then he [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5652.34s)]
*  like goes downstairs and he keeps on saying bye. His little homies going slow. He doesn't realize [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5657.54s)]
*  he got shorter legs and he's like, oh, come on little buddy. That's not as bad. That's not as bad. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5662.9s)]
*  Okay. See, this is a perfect example of fake news. I got fake news. Nah, that's fucked up. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5667.38s)]
*  I still wouldn't have him watch my kid though. Yeah, he's busy. I want you working on shit. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5674.18s)]
*  Yeah, dude. So we're going to see how long do you think it is before we feel some of the [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5680.82s)]
*  negative or positive effects of the cuts? I think short term will feel more pain, I think. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5686.58s)]
*  I just think in general, a lot of the ideas are going to cause some short term pain for long term [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5692.98s)]
*  gain. I think it's going to be so hard to tell. I literally think it's going to be like a Rorschach. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5696.5s)]
*  Let's say prices come down for everything. What's a Rorschach? That like ink blot shit [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5700.5s)]
*  where you see what you feel already? I wonder if people on the left will see all the media, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5704.34s)]
*  they cut this thing and there's a teacher that died and then the homeless thing got worse. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5709.46s)]
*  Even if the price of things are coming down, they'll be like, yeah, this country's going to [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5713.54s)]
*  shit. Then people on the right, let's say prices don't move at all, but then they're seeing all [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5716.900000000001s)]
*  these headlines that are like, everything's great, we're saving all this money, the budget's at a [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5720.82s)]
*  surplus. See, it worked. I think media will just manipulate people's minds where they'll just say [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5723.78s)]
*  whatever the thing they're feeding is. I think it'll be dependent on whatever they're concerned. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5729.46s)]
*  I think it all depends on how the economy is and if people feel like they have money in their [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5732.900000000001s)]
*  pockets. I think it all comes down to it. At the end. How do you make people feel that? What does [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5736.5s)]
*  create a thriving economy? Either low inflation or stimulus checks. For example, how do you [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5740.98s)]
*  address inflation? My understanding is the way that you address inflation is you restrict or [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5750.259999999999s)]
*  constrict the money supply. If there's less money out there, if there's more money than there are [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5755.7s)]
*  things to buy, the price of things is just crazy. Yeah. I think it's called the, you're trying to [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5765.0599999999995s)]
*  slow the liquidity of money through monetary policy. Yeah. The only way to do that is to keep [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5770.34s)]
*  interest rates high. But if you keep interest rates high, it stifles economic growth because [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5775.62s)]
*  you need liquidity for growth. It's a really fucked up thing. It's almost like you need to [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5781.06s)]
*  just plunder another country to take all their wealth. That works back in the day. Who should [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5785.54s)]
*  we pretend has nukes? I think we need to look into Canada. Canada got nukes. Canada does have [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5792.9s)]
*  jokers. This whole cut thing was a front and he's actually building tons of nukes. Where do you think [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5801.86s)]
*  he got the nukes from? His dad. Cuba. So he's got the nukes shipped in. So you guys keep an eye on him. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5805.0599999999995s)]
*  51st state. Is there any country rich enough where we could just plunder that bitch? Yeah, Canada. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5811.46s)]
*  Their nukes are at Drake's house. That's why it's called the embassy. We need to get in there. We [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5816.179999999999s)]
*  need to really just take things apart. And that's ours now. Just a couple meme coins and rug pulls. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5820.0199999999995s)]
*  USA coin rug pulls and fire. No, but I think the Stimmi Check doesn't work. That's what [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5828.9s)]
*  causes the inflation. So I think, I don't know. To me, I just remember, and everybody's going to be [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5833.0599999999995s)]
*  personal. I remember Bill Clinton. I was eight years old. My dad went from having no job. We [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5837.7s)]
*  opened a business. I was like, oh, in this four years seems like we're doing better. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5842.419999999999s)]
*  I remember I'm 10, so I know nothing. But I'm like, Bill Clinton seems to be doing a good job. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5846.26s)]
*  And that was also during the first tech boom. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5851.46s)]
*  Yeah. Which is maybe the only reason it happened. I don't know. But we just go off what we're [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5855.14s)]
*  feeling. I also think corporate greed is probably the biggest factor. I think we're just so concerned [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5859.54s)]
*  with how the stocks, like how things are going in the stock market. And so we're squeezing. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5868.98s)]
*  We're squeezing the lower and middle class as much as possible. And we have no power to say [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5878.259999999999s)]
*  anything. So because power to make change. If you squeeze, when you say squeeze the lower [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5884.099999999999s)]
*  and middle class, you mean like by paying them less, we can show more profits. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5890.179999999999s)]
*  And then the stock price goes up. My responsibility is to my shareholder. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5895.780000000001s)]
*  That's that fucking line you can hide behind for. Some shit I just saw. DoorDash got sued for like [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5900.660000000001s)]
*  20 million because they were taking people's tips and using that money to pay the wages of. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5906.18s)]
*  So when they say 100% of the money goes towards the delivery person, they're still not lying. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5915.06s)]
*  That's fucked up. I mean, that's what restaurants do. I think minimum wage is like $15 an hour in [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5920.42s)]
*  some states now. But restaurants would pay you $3 an hour because they count your tips as part [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5926.66s)]
*  of your wage. But at least you know that going into it. DoorDash is like, oh no, you didn't get [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5932.66s)]
*  any tips. And then just using that money to pay their delivery fee. Yeah, that is fucked up because [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5938.26s)]
*  we know that the waiters aren't making any money outside of tips. You gotta get it out. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5944.42s)]
*  Thank you, my boy. I got it. Yeah. So we overcompensate. Yeah. But with DoorDash, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5948.66s)]
*  you're just giving them whatever y'all give. Yeah. And that's a thing. All these corporations [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5954.82s)]
*  are doing similar shit like that. Amazon workers, they barely get paid. Have you spoken to Uber [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5960.82s)]
*  drivers recently? No. So like a lot of the Uber drivers when they first started, Uber was taking [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5965.78s)]
*  like 15%, 20%. Now that shit has come up to like 30, 40 in certain places. Dude, I'll see. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5969.94s)]
*  That's fucking nuts. Sometimes I'll ask an Uber driver, what'd you get for this? And it will be [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5976.58s)]
*  less than half of what I paid. Like considerably less. Wow. Like six bucks for a $25 Uber or [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5981.38s)]
*  whatever. So basically what they did is they lost money to gain market share. Yeah. And that is the [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5986.74s)]
*  strategy of these tech businesses now. Or maybe businesses in general now. So they don't have to [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5992.18s)]
*  show profit at all. And they'll lose money as long as the stock is cooking. Yeah. But what happens is [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=5998.02s)]
*  what you're saying is that all these people that are driving are eventually going to go, you know [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6005.3s)]
*  what? I got to now work 80 hours a week to make what I used to make driving a taxi 40 hours. Yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6009.14s)]
*  Or 60 hours, whatever the fuck they would do. And they got no voice. They got no lobbyists. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6015.62s)]
*  They have no lobby, no health insurance. And it's, I mean, I guess it's not a monopoly. There is [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6020.820000000001s)]
*  Lyft, but you know, Lyft is also going to cook you as well. That's the airline shit too, where it's [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6026.26s)]
*  like, y'all pretend you're competing or not. There's a certain level below which you know [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6030.58s)]
*  you're not going to go. And this is what it is. It's like, they're both in goods. It's like, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6034.1s)]
*  yeah, let's keep these prices this way. Oligopoly or whatever it's called. Which is like, you guys [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6038.42s)]
*  control everything. Which is technically illegal. Yeah. But it's going on. How are you going to prove it? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6042.02s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then you can imagine some driver has been out of the workforce for four years, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6044.820000000001s)]
*  five years, immigrant, doesn't have work experience or whatever. Like where else is he going to go? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6048.900000000001s)]
*  Where else? So you're like, yeah, I'll just eat it. Yeah. And like, even partly with my business, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6052.820000000001s)]
*  I see that. Like I made it a point to like overpay because I've always been in production and I'm [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6058.82s)]
*  like, you know what, like, let me change things that bothered me back in the day. And that does [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6064.42s)]
*  stifle growth. Like I, because I pay my employees really well, I can't open as many studios as I [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6070.82s)]
*  would like to. I have to wait till we, you know, build it up and now we can. So it's like, I see [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6076.0199999999995s)]
*  what would motivate a business owner to pay less because I can grow my shit way faster. But at the [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6080.82s)]
*  same time, it's like, you just have to have zero empathy for people and that shit sucks. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6085.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's easy for me. I don't know. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6088.9s)]
*  And then the people with no empathy like rise to the top. Yeah. True. You know what I mean? Like [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6094.0199999999995s)]
*  all these like corporate CEOs are just like cutthroat and they're like, yeah, I'm fine. I can [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6097.46s)]
*  sleep at night. So I'm good on that. Yeah. And also you get better work. I think when people feel, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6101.38s)]
*  you know, like they're properly compensated, you know, they build their identity around the job. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6108.099999999999s)]
*  It's hard to build your identity around a job where you feel taken advantage of, you know, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6112.74s)]
*  but if you create the job or they don't have to have an identity, it's like an assembly line [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6116.98s)]
*  and people just come in and you're like, all right, you don't like it. Yep. See you later. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6120.179999999999s)]
*  If you make them easily replaceable. Yeah. Uber, Amazon, all these places. Yeah. Dude, I've had [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6123.3s)]
*  Amazon employees tell me like they'll get hurt on the job, but they're afraid to go get medical care [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6130.42s)]
*  or whatever, because they're going to get in trouble. So they just keep working. They're afraid [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6135.38s)]
*  to get replaced by a robot or whatever. They just keep working. It's not that bathroom breaks get [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6138.66s)]
*  toned. I mean, that's not like, I mean, that's why I'm at first. Yeah. I'm the reason why that exists. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6142.5s)]
*  I'm taking 30 minutes. How are you getting hurt at the Amazon factory? The warehouse. Oh, the [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6148.98s)]
*  warehouse. Yeah. Yeah. Putting a thing in the box. Yeah. Lifting boxes, probably doing all this [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6153.38s)]
*  shit. Yeah. There's machinery going everywhere. It's like in forklifts and yeah, you're going to get [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6157.46s)]
*  hurt. Yeah. That shit sucks. But corporations fire though. You know what I mean? They really do make [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6161.54s)]
*  some great shit. Order something that comes in next day. They keep making it so convenient. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6167.3s)]
*  We're kind of fucked or like we're trapped into it. Are you ever calling not Lyft or Uber? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6176.42s)]
*  Like going out grabbing a taxi. So we're all like, this is what happens. They make a better product. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6181.06s)]
*  So we're like, yeah, sure. And you get, you're removed enough from that person that you're like, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6186.18s)]
*  well, I don't really, I can't care that they're getting fucked. It's just, it's convenient for me. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6191.06s)]
*  And that's what it is. I'm not. That's why, and I remember is actually Vivek's book I was reading [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6195.86s)]
*  where he was like every corporation's fiduciary responsibilities to the shareholders. And I was [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6202.0199999999995s)]
*  like, that is a fucking thing. That's what they all hide behind. Oh, I don't have to care about [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6205.219999999999s)]
*  the employee. My responsibilities to my shareholder. That line in and of itself is just such a like [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6210.58s)]
*  catch all for having to give a fuck about anyone below me. Yeah, dude. It's a good point made there, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6215.7s)]
*  Mark about if you can create a business with replaceable employees, you really don't have to [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6222.1s)]
*  care about your employees at all. Yeah. And those businesses don't. Yeah. And they're incredibly [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6229.14s)]
*  profitable. There's the Henry Ford thing. I think he did that with like the yeah. I'm just like, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6235.38s)]
*  no, but his initially the idea with the, with the, uh, maybe this is propaganda, but the idea was I [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6241.06s)]
*  want everybody that works here to be able to afford the car. Oh, that is true. Yeah. Now that [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6246.98s)]
*  could be Henry Ford Association going, all right, let's not make him look like a fucking animal, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6251.94s)]
*  make it look like he cares about the workers. But that was the idea that they can make a car [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6257.0599999999995s)]
*  cheap enough that the people that worked at the plant could drive one. And if that is the case, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6260.98s)]
*  imagine you're working at a fucking plant and you're driving to work every single day. You must [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6265.379999999999s)]
*  feel like the fucking man. Yeah. And we pride there's a lot of pride there. And also like when [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6270.58s)]
*  you look at especially in in, it's Detroit, right? Where the General Motors were, or at least [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6274.42s)]
*  Michigan, right? Like, yeah, you would have like generations of families work at those plants and [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6279.7s)]
*  be proud of it. Like they were proud to be part of that community. And then when those plants left, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6284.34s)]
*  it was devastating. But I guess that was a time where like the cost of goods and wage was more [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6289.7s)]
*  similar. And then now it's like, it was also in corporate greed was that no, I don't want to say [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6293.38s)]
*  it was at a low, it was lower. There was it's like, they didn't know how greedy they could get. Yeah. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6298.34s)]
*  So okay, so and again, difference between like CEO pay and the workers pay was as the gap. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6302.9s)]
*  What's the justification for that now? But like, is the I know, I don't know, just location. I [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6308.82s)]
*  know when it really started to go crazy was we fought to have CEO salaries made public because [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6314.259999999999s)]
*  we were like, we want to see how overpaid these people are. But then it's like NBA contracts, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6318.66s)]
*  you see what they're making and you're like, oh, you need to pay me more than that. Oh, you need [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6322.82s)]
*  to pay me more than that. You pay me more than and then just goes bang, bang, bang. Because NBA, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6326.58s)]
*  NFL, a lot of times it's not about how much I make, it's about how much more than that guy. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6330.18s)]
*  Yeah. And it's how much he makes. So once you start making these contracts public and I'm, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6333.38s)]
*  I'm a yeah, I don't know how you get that genie back in the bottle or whatever. But like that [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6337.700000000001s)]
*  inflated a lot. Yeah, you don't get it back in the bottle. Capitalism people like, you can't tell me [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6342.1s)]
*  how much I deserve to be paid for this. And everybody thinks, oh, one day that's going to [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6347.14s)]
*  be me. And I don't want somebody telling me how much I can get paid. All right, questions. It was [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6351.9400000000005s)]
*  less pushback is is just shoot these motherfuckers. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6355.46s)]
*  Now, but it's like certain industries got that right idea. But is like the skill of certain CEOs, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6361.7s)]
*  like for example, like, what's Steve Jobs, right? Yeah, like whatever he got paid, he deserved it. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6368.58s)]
*  Like he transformed an industry, transformed the world in a lot of ways. Yeah. Right. So you [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6375.94s)]
*  can't really put a dollar amount on them on on him, like what he's worth to the company, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6380.98s)]
*  like are certain are these certain CEOs like are they worth these exorbitant amount of money? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6385.459999999999s)]
*  This is sort of my money because that's what they bring to the brand. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6390.179999999999s)]
*  Certain. Yeah, I'm sure that's what they would argue. And again, it's like the NBA. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6393.7s)]
*  I could run is worth 100 million a year or whatever. I guess what I'm trying to [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6397.219999999999s)]
*  like LeBron, it's so easy to see because he's six, nine. He got the handle like a point guard. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6401.54s)]
*  He's got vision. He could shoot. He's obviously proven winner. I think with the CEOs, a lot of [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6405.54s)]
*  times we look at them outside of like a jobs or a Musk and we're just like, oh, it's just like a [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6409.86s)]
*  white guy who wears a suit and he just tells people what they do. Like, do they have these [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6414.179999999999s)]
*  distinguishable skills? Maybe if we knew more about what they're actually doing for a company, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6418.179999999999s)]
*  maybe it would seem more just a viable to us. Yeah. Maybe it does that make sense? Maybe they [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6423.62s)]
*  are LeBron esque and how unique their skill set is. But even though like what Elon does for Tesla, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6428.58s)]
*  Elon could be like, hey, we can make less profits this year and pay all of our employees more. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6436.02s)]
*  And every company can do that. Got it. And you're saying this was the share price goes down. Yeah. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6442.42s)]
*  My responsibility to the shareholders. Yeah. So the share price goes down because it's not. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6448.66s)]
*  That's why food and this is why again, I don't think food should be publicly traded. That's why [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6455.3s)]
*  food they're like, oh, I could put all these chemicals in it for less cost and the real [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6459.9400000000005s)]
*  ingredients of Cheetos, it'll drive the cost down. The share price goes up for Frito-Lay. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6463.14s)]
*  That's my responsibilities. Yeah. Corporate buyouts happen. A big company comes in, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6467.38s)]
*  buys a small like mom tops things, very popular. They figure out how they can cut costs. They fire [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6472.5s)]
*  certain people, they put different chemicals or make the product worse in a certain way, but [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6477.860000000001s)]
*  small enough that it's not that noticeable. The product is then cheaper to produce and the company [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6482.9800000000005s)]
*  can go, look what we did. We year over year, we're 50% better, 20% better. Quarter over quarter, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6488.1s)]
*  we're increasing profits. So it's just one of the downsides is like unfettered capitalism, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6493.3s)]
*  but you just need some type of legislation like protect it so that it can still grow. But then to [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6500.5s)]
*  not, you know, like, yeah, you don't want to over legislate it, but also you need to keep some [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6505.14s)]
*  guardrails to stop, you know, monopolies. This is where it's a push and pull like unions. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6511.22s)]
*  Some would say that the car unions got so powerful. That's why American cars started to get worse. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6515.22s)]
*  Japanese cars were taken over and then Ford ends up shutting down, et cetera, et cetera. Now I'm [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6520.74s)]
*  not saying that's what the answer, but it is, it just, I think has to be a constant push and pull. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6524.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Rockefeller beat the whole game. He would just like create the standard oil, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6529.22s)]
*  got so big. And then we'll just go into towns with other oil companies and be like, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6533.7s)]
*  so you can either sell to us for 50% of what you're worth, or we'll just take over your area. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6537.22s)]
*  When we open up a standard oil right here, because we have so much funding and we have [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6541.94s)]
*  such a great assembly line that we'll just take you over. So what do you want to do? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6545.94s)]
*  And then he just like steamrolled everyone and literally broke capitalism. And then we're like, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6548.74s)]
*  all right, we got to put it. Then we broke up saying our oil in 1910 or whatever. And then we're [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6552.259999999999s)]
*  like, all right, we got, we can't just let this rule the world. How did he deal with that? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6555.94s)]
*  Emotionally, I know you were reading that, that biography. And did he have any kind of like [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6559.86s)]
*  turmoil about doing that to people? Did he feel justified in some? I mean, yes and no. He was [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6566.9s)]
*  just like, these are the rules of the game. And he was like a super strict business guy. Like he [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6571.06s)]
*  counted every penny in his personal bank account. Like in his journals, he would have like a ledger [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6574.18s)]
*  of like every single dollar that was going in and out. So like on the one hand, he was ruthless. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6577.9400000000005s)]
*  But on the other hand, he was like super philanthropic, opened all these like HBCUs, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6581.3s)]
*  like Spelman College, like a famous HBCU was named after his wife, Sette Spelman. So he like opened [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6585.46s)]
*  up all these like black universities. He's like, yeah, we got to like give black people. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6590.820000000001s)]
*  Was she white, black? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6593.22s)]
*  No, she was white. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6594.02s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6594.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And he was like, we got to support like black people in America and like give people [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6595.3s)]
*  opportunity. So like, I think he kind of justified it through like philanthropic stuff. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6598.34s)]
*  The cynic in me is like, yo, let's just keep shit segregated. I'll just open for school. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6602.18s)]
*  Wait, we got all these workers that don't know how to fucking mine oil. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6607.7s)]
*  Do an oil mining class. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6611.46s)]
*  Oh, fuck. Yeah. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6613.54s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if that's what if that's what charity is to some of these incredibly wealthy [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6616.02s)]
*  people, if it's just a way to like get to heaven, like it's a way to offset the fuck shit. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6624.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I do think he was also religious because I think he was like, dude, God gave me this. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6632.099999999999s)]
*  Like this is by this is ordained by God. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6635.86s)]
*  You justify your fuck shit by this is what God wanted me to do. And then you do some good on the [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6638.419999999999s)]
*  side as a token of your gratitude. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6643.94s)]
*  In a way. Yes. Yeah. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6648.259999999999s)]
*  In a way. Yes. Yeah. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6649.7s)]
*  Because sometimes I do feel like people and we should do more philanthropy. We should figure [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6650.9s)]
*  out how we can how we can give back. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6654.98s)]
*  Yeah, I should. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6656.74s)]
*  Oh, we got you here. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6659.14s)]
*  But we should figure out how we can give back but give back in a way where it doesn't feel like [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6662.9s)]
*  sometimes I see people doing it and it feels so like self aggrandizing. You know, like, I like, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6666.58s)]
*  I don't know if the money is actually trickling to the charity. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6673.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6676.5s)]
*  It feels almost more of like a pat on the back. It's like a public display. If I'm a good person, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6676.9s)]
*  and this is why you guys should believe I'm a good person, but then people aren't actually [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6682.0199999999995s)]
*  getting helped. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6685.38s)]
*  Yes, but not everything. Oh, sorry. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6685.94s)]
*  This is just happening right now. There's a lot of CEOs that are basically like doing the [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6688.0199999999995s)]
*  Rockefeller thing where they create a nonprofit foundation. That nonprofit foundation is actually [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6691.54s)]
*  not funding. It's sort of like a money laundering place. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6697.62s)]
*  And then they put their kids as the presidents and CEOs of that foundation and they get a salary [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6701.139999999999s)]
*  and that salary is half a million dollars a year. So now you're finding a way to funnel money to [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6706.34s)]
*  your kids through this nonprofit. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6710.74s)]
*  And some of them do great. Some of them really do great. And some people have done great. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6712.9800000000005s)]
*  Rockefeller did great at the end. Like Bill Gates has stopped hookworm, guinea worm, something. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6716.02s)]
*  Like there's a lot of them that have done great, but there are some that are using it sort of. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6723.06s)]
*  I'm sure there are plenty that do good things. But I wonder if it... [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6726.26s)]
*  And not everything is money. Like I have classes come to WTF and like I just talk to the kids and [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6729.62s)]
*  shit like that. And you never know that might just open their mind, help them see something. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6735.86s)]
*  Throw a fucking benefit show where just like underprivileged people are able to come to show [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6739.78s)]
*  for free. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6744.339999999999s)]
*  Find a way to not give money. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6744.74s)]
*  I'm just saying not everything's about money. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6746.98s)]
*  No, you're right. You're right. There's a lot of times influence is going to be way more impactful. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6749.299999999999s)]
*  And I also wonder if trying to solve the biggest problem isn't the most effective way of doing your [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6753.7s)]
*  charity. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6760.42s)]
*  There's small things. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6760.82s)]
*  That's the thing. That's the thing. What I think Portnoy does brilliantly, like going to a specific [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6762.18s)]
*  place and giving them money to stay open. Like we are saving this restaurant. We're not going, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6767.46s)]
*  hey, we're going to save the restaurant industry. That's a nice thing on paper. That looks really [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6775.700000000001s)]
*  good. You get to pat yourself on the back and maybe some people in the world are like, look at [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6780.42s)]
*  how benevolent that human being is. But going to one mom and pop shop, speaking to the mom and pop [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6783.860000000001s)]
*  and saving their business. Maybe it saved it for a year. Maybe it saved for two years. Maybe it [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6790.34s)]
*  saved for 20. Who fucking knows? But I wonder if that's the most direct impact you can have. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6793.860000000001s)]
*  That starfish story. You ever heard that? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6799.7s)]
*  No. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6801.06s)]
*  My dad told me this. It's like all these starfish roll up on the shore after a big storm. Some kids [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6801.22s)]
*  throw them back in the ocean. And some guy comes up, he's like, dude, there's thousands of starfish. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6807.46s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? Doesn't make a difference. And he takes a starfish, throws in the water, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6810.900000000001s)]
*  goes, made a difference to that one. That's kind of a cute little story. But it kind of goes to [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6814.66s)]
*  that point. Like, yeah, just finding specific people that need help and then helping them in [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6818.1s)]
*  that way. It's also more fulfilling on a personal basis. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6822.02s)]
*  Do feel good after. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6825.54s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6826.740000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to feed all the African kids. You know what I mean? Let's just feed some Africans here. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6827.780000000001s)]
*  Take an Uber drive. Be like, yo, just go through the fucking drive-through. Whatever you want. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6834.34s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6837.06s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking ring it up. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6837.620000000001s)]
*  Feed some Elans African kids. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6839.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, dude. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6841.14s)]
*  Are we getting commie-pilled right now? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6844.18s)]
*  We're getting commie-pilled. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6845.38s)]
*  Dude, we gotta stop this. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6846.18s)]
*  Are we commies? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6848.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to stand for this commie talk, all right? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6848.820000000001s)]
*  Hey, Mark, you're learning hypnosis? What's going on with you? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6850.740000000001s)]
*  I'm reading one book on hypnosis. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6852.740000000001s)]
*  This is weird. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6854.18s)]
*  It's not weird, first off. I just want to learn the secrets. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6854.9800000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6857.860000000001s)]
*  The secrets of hypnosis. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6858.1s)]
*  Why would you want to learn that? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6859.22s)]
*  Let's talk about this on Patreon. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6860.5s)]
*  Okay, one slight reason, okay, is I'm genuinely curious if hypnosis is real. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6862.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6866.66s)]
*  So like, do you believe in hypnosis? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6867.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6869.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6869.780000000001s)]
*  Do you think that people can be put into a subconscious state where their mind is now [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6870.1s)]
*  controlled by another person? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6872.740000000001s)]
*  Some people. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6873.62s)]
*  Blacks. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6874.42s)]
*  Why is it blacks? Why is it not black? [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6875.860000000001s)]
*  Because our mind is better. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6877.62s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6879.3s)]
*  Smarter people are apparently easier to hypnotize, just as they tell dumb people who they hypnotize. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-a-yj2k67Q&t=6880.1s)]
