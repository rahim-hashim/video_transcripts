# Young Thug Trial Breakdown, Special Olympics Doping & Being Black Larry David
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk)
*  You're like a Black Larry David. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=0.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1.3s)]
*  My maximum irritation come from me waiting for people. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2.9s)]
*  That's why I check a bag. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5.4s)]
*  Everyone is giving me shit about it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6.5s)]
*  But the truth is, not checking a bag [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  only makes sense if waiting for your bag [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=9.24s)]
*  is the number one concern. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=11.48s)]
*  For me, I like to get on the plane last. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=13.14s)]
*  I don't want to get on early because I don't [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=14.98s)]
*  want to be sitting there all the time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=16.28s)]
*  What happens is sometimes people will take the above space. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=17.28s)]
*  So you've got to put your shit back deeper. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=20.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=22.52s)]
*  And then you've got to wait for all these fucks to get [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=23.72s)]
*  off the plane before you get on the plane. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=24.78s)]
*  And that is the moment where I might fucking pop. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=26.12s)]
*  You don't like the S&M? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=28.66s)]
*  Nah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=29.58s)]
*  Nobody want no pay. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=30.66s)]
*  That's going to take me out of the whole thing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=31.66s)]
*  I don't want to get choked, scratched, nigger poked, shocked. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=32.76s)]
*  The tie-ups. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=36.32s)]
*  As if we can't hold them there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=37.12s)]
*  Like, it's just redundant. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=38.9s)]
*  Have you ever dated someone who's dead? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=40.1s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=41.64s)]
*  Hooked up with someone who's dead now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=42.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=43.66s)]
*  And? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=44.46s)]
*  Well, they died after. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=45.26s)]
*  So that's the people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  I hope they die. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=46.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=47.94s)]
*  Crazier questions have been asked on this podcast. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=49.14s)]
*  Have you jerked off her since? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=50.5s)]
*  No. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=51.7s)]
*  Just this? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=52.5s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=53.3s)]
*  You've got to delete dead people after Spank Bang. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=54.54s)]
*  No, because what if she's like an angel watching down? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=55.64s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=57.58s)]
*  She's looking at her work. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Love you, grandma. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=60.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=61.14s)]

*  Are you going to Primal, or what is it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=122.98s)]
*  I'm just trying to eat what our ancestors ate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=125.02s)]
*  That's my object. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=127.52s)]
*  But they didn't have Zins. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  They didn't have Zins. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=129.52s)]
*  But they had to go run around and shit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  But it is funny. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=131.66s)]

*  He just got away. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=139.1s)]
*  It's like your ancestor diet. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=141.6s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=143.3s)]
*  Primal. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=144.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=144.94s)]
*  Well, they also ate Harry Pussy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=145.74s)]
*  Are you doing that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=146.58s)]
*  Of course, bro. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=147.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's part of the diet. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=148.28s)]
*  That's how I get my protein up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=149.36s)]
*  I'm holding a, we call them a person, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=150.56s)]
*  I hold them with consistency. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=152.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=153.7s)]
*  All the shit they was doing back there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=154.7s)]
*  Do you think they ate pussy back there? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=156.0s)]
*  I don't know if they did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=157.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they even got consent back then. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=158.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=161.74s)]
*  We got to check the record on that, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=162.74s)]
*  because it seems like that's a liability. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=163.84s)]
*  How can we check the record? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=165.2s)]
*  That's not check very, very, very good. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=166.14s)]
*  I mean, there's got to be like images of it in a cave. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=167.64s)]
*  A cave drawing? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=169.48s)]
*  Images of a pussy eating? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=170.28s)]
*  I think a guy going down with a girl. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=171.54s)]
*  I mean, I think it started happening. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=172.98s)]
*  I mean, it was pretty... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=174.36s)]
*  Well, a lot of the early people were black, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=175.66s)]
*  and I don't think y'all ate pussy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=177.06s)]
*  You think they did? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=178.2s)]
*  That's a fantastic point. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=179.3s)]
*  Yeah, white people really invented that shit with the colt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=180.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=182.98s)]
*  Pussy wasn't eatable in the sub-Saharan Africa. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=184.18s)]
*  No, it's true. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=186.38s)]
*  But we had eatable pussy before fire, though. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=187.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=189.88s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=190.98s)]
*  There might have been people who did it, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=192.08s)]
*  but it wasn't like... [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=193.18s)]
*  How did they describe good pussy before fire? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=194.28s)]
*  What did they even say? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=195.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=196.82s)]
*  Yo, this shit is water, bro. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=197.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know when pussies started getting eaten. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=205.1s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=208.2s)]
*  When did you start? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=209.3s)]
*  Eating pussy? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=210.4s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, man, in my 20s. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=211.5s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=213.5s)]
*  When I wear... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=214.6s)]
*  Because before that... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=215.7s)]
*  That's pretty grown to do it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=216.8s)]
*  You had no curiosity? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=217.9s)]
*  No, because we were shamed about it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=219.0s)]
*  By whom? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=222.0s)]
*  I was at the tail end of that, where it was like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=223.1s)]
*  people didn't... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=225.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, black dudes, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=226.62s)]
*  this is a more recent thing, to eat pussy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=227.72s)]
*  He did, because he's half Latino. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=229.82s)]
*  They didn't mean to eat pussy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  They would do it, they just wouldn't tell you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=235.56s)]
*  And why was it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=236.66s)]
*  Is it the positioning? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=237.76s)]
*  Is it your butt being in the air or something? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, I just think... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=241.56s)]
*  I think it's like an extra macho thing put on black men. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=242.66s)]
*  Where you kind of... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=245.78s)]
*  It's like there's an expectation that you... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=246.88s)]
*  Don't eat pussy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=248.98s)]
*  Well, that you do whatever the manliest thing available. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think back then it wasn't seen as manly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  That was an Italian thing too, apparently. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=254.68s)]
*  I remember an episode of Sopranos, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=256.28s)]
*  one of the old mob bosses had like a mistress, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=257.88s)]
*  and then she told people that he went down on her [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=259.98s)]
*  and he broke up with her. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=261.98s)]
*  He was like in love with her, but he's like, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=262.98s)]
*  fuck you, how dare you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=264.58000000000004s)]
*  They had that episode? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=265.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  They had that episode of Family Matters, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=267.88s)]
*  the don't eat pussy episode. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=269.36s)]
*  It was a big PSA. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  Be careful. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=272.56s)]
*  Miracle was doing it a lot. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=273.66s)]
*  Okay, so as a grown man, 20 years old, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=274.76s)]
*  you go down on a girl for the first time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=277.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=278.66s)]
*  Black chick, white chick? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=279.76s)]
*  White chick. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=280.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  Did she just expect it and you're like, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=283.06s)]
*  okay, I gotta do this? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=284.16s)]
*  Or you actually wanted to, you were curious? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=285.26s)]
*  Nah, I was just trying to remember [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=286.38s)]
*  what I was being told by the OGs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=291.18s)]
*  The OGs, the Wynos, the creepy uncles. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=295.38s)]
*  All of you were like, all right, now when you get in there, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=296.48s)]
*  now make sure you got the, yeah, I didn't do it good. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=298.38s)]
*  Yeah, what were you even doing? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=301.68s)]
*  What strategy was that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=304.06s)]
*  Because you know what's weird? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=305.16s)]
*  We think that the only thing between us [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=306.26s)]
*  and doing well is just getting to the pussy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=311.16s)]
*  But you're not just automatically [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=314.26s)]
*  going to be good at this shit. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=315.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=316.66s)]
*  But comics especially are fucked up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=317.76s)]
*  One thing, ask any comicist question. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=319.88s)]
*  Are you better at comedy or fucking? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=321.58s)]
*  And what would they say? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=323.68s)]
*  They will say, they will act like it's a hard... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=324.78s)]
*  Shit, that's the easiest question [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=326.88s)]
*  I've been asking all night, dog. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=329.28s)]
*  I never insult my comedy like that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  You think about that fucking question. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=332.78s)]
*  You know, it's funny, in my head, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=334.28s)]
*  I literally was thinking, yeah, they can't fuck. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=335.38s)]
*  We, you know, everybody think they're good at, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  it's driving, comedy, and fucking. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=341.9s)]
*  Well, sex is a little easier because it's mostly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=344.4s)]
*  like the same person, you know what I mean? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=345.9s)]
*  But like stand-up is different people all the time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=347.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=349.2s)]
*  Also, like, what, okay. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=350.12s)]
*  You're married. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=352.22s)]
*  When you say you're good at sex. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  You don't say mostly. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=354.82000000000005s)]
*  But you're one of the top comics in the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=355.92s)]
*  You're not one of the top fuckers in the world. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  Fuckers in the world, no. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=360.54s)]
*  But also, like, what makes you good at sex? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=361.64000000000004s)]
*  Like, what, is it the bag? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=363.54s)]
*  Like, when it comes to basketball, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=366.54s)]
*  there's a bag, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=368.24s)]
*  Do you, can you have crossover? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you have any of all the things? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  When it comes to sex, I judge it by [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=372.74s)]
*  if the girl orgasms or not. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=376.04s)]
*  Right, I think that's part of it for sure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=378.9s)]
*  So, but you could do nothing and then they orgasm. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=380.4s)]
*  So does that make you good at sex? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=385.38s)]
*  That's a hot crowd, dog. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=386.48s)]
*  That's a hot crowd. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=387.58s)]
*  Or that might just be a hot crowd. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=388.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=389.78s)]
*  The audience is kind of, you know how you say [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=390.88s)]
*  the rim isn't always 10 feet in comedy? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=392.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=393.92s)]
*  I would assume it's like that with sex. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=395.02s)]
*  I don't know, but I would assume it's like that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=396.62s)]
*  No, no, you're making a good point. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=398.32s)]
*  Like, sometimes the crowd is really good. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=399.32s)]
*  Sometimes you perform at the Ice House. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=400.86s)]
*  Sometimes it's so easier like this, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=402.4s)]
*  this ain't me, this them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=404.06s)]
*  So. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=405.7s)]
*  Right, I get that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=406.6s)]
*  You know, sometimes it's only black dudes that do this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=407.68s)]
*  They have like a video where they're like doing air humping [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=410.22s)]
*  and they're doing like the worm and shit like that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=413.82000000000005s)]
*  They're like, it's only black dudes on TikTok or Instagram. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=415.92s)]
*  I've never seen one white guy like do his fuck moves [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  on nothing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=421.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's like R&B video choreography [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  from the 90s. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=424.6s)]
*  Yeah, but we do like air guitar. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=425.6s)]
*  You guys actually do air fucking, okay? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=427.1s)]
*  And I see those moves. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=430.40000000000003s)]

*  with the prosecutor, which was illegal. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=706.76s)]
*  So the judge and the prosecutor did some illegal shit. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=708.62s)]
*  The lawyer found out about it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=711.66s)]
*  The lawyer snitched, and the judge [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=713.3s)]
*  was like, you're going to go to jail for saying [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=714.9399999999999s)]
*  that we did something illegal. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=717.54s)]
*  That seems like he called the mount on it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=719.5s)]
*  And he was like, how'd you find that out? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=721.68s)]
*  And he was like, I'm not going to tell you how I found it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=723.5799999999999s)]
*  It's none of your business how I found it out. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=725.28s)]
*  Well, that's what he held him in contempt for. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=726.54s)]
*  But why does he have to be honest about that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=728.14s)]
*  when they can have this meeting without telling people [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=729.88s)]
*  that they shouldn't have had? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=732.78s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  He caught him out there. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=734.48s)]
*  And that's why the judge got taken over. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=735.28s)]
*  And then the judge was taken off, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=738.26s)]
*  replaced by another judge. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=740.72s)]
*  And then that judge recused herself. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=742.26s)]
*  So now they own a third judge. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=744.26s)]
*  Oh, he's getting off. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=746.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=747.0s)]
*  Oh, Yungtung getting off. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=747.9s)]
*  I'm starting to think that the dumber attorneys [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=749.4s)]
*  are prosecutors. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=751.64s)]
*  Like, you just watch these cases that are supposed [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=753.06s)]
*  to be slam dunks, and the prosecution [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=755.26s)]
*  fumbles the fuck out of it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=756.8s)]
*  OJ, there was one in Dallas with a politician. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=758.3s)]
*  The most evil ones is prosecutors. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=760.9s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=763.64s)]
*  The ones that's like, they'd rather take a pay cut. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=764.84s)]
*  Just to put somebody. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=768.62s)]
*  Just to fuck people. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=769.74s)]
*  I think they're just not smart enough to be defense. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=770.72s)]
*  I think the smartest ones are like, hey, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=773.96s)]
*  I can get paid millions of dollars to bet. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=775.88s)]
*  Not even to killers, like rich people on tax shit. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=777.76s)]
*  I can make so much money defending the vile people, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=780.84s)]
*  why would I be a prosecutor? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=783.72s)]
*  And then what's left of the prosecution jobs, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=785.0200000000001s)]
*  a bunch of fucking idiots who can't prosecute OJ. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=787.22s)]
*  They're just like, ah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=790.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=791.5200000000001s)]
*  No, no, I think you're onto it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=792.32s)]
*  Because if you could make tons of money, most people would. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a few people who are just like great teachers, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  for example. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=799.44s)]
*  But like, if you're teaching finance, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=801.2s)]
*  but you could run a hedge fund, you're [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=803.5400000000001s)]
*  probably going to run the fucking hedge fund. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=806.24s)]
*  But there's a few people who are like, I just love teaching [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=807.44s)]
*  kids, and I want to, you know. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  Help the next generation. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=810.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  But those are few and far between. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=812.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=813.46s)]
*  But I feel like the prosecutors are [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=814.2600000000001s)]
*  like aspiring politicians, because they usually [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=815.5s)]
*  have the prosecution. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=818.2s)]
*  Those are probably the best prosecutors. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  Politicians are geniuses. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=822.1800000000001s)]
*  That's the worst people. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=822.98s)]
*  Where? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=824.0400000000001s)]
*  Who? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=824.84s)]
*  Fannie Whitley, the young prosecutor, that bitch is evil. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=825.94s)]
*  Where? Why? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=827.74s)]
*  Where she. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=828.58s)]
*  The DA, you're saying? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=829.3800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the DA. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=830.3800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=831.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=832.0200000000001s)]
*  Why is she evil? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=832.82s)]
*  Because you know what the meeting was about? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=833.86s)]
*  They were trying to threaten a witness. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=835.1800000000001s)]
*  So a witness was supposed to testify against young thugs. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  He said he didn't want to. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  So they had a meeting with him, the judge, and the judge [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  was basically saying, hey, so I'll keep you in jail. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=847.9s)]
*  If you don't testify, I'll keep you in jail [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=851.5s)]
*  until all these trials are over, because it's a RICO case. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=853.6s)]
*  So he's basically like getting his back. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=856.8s)]
*  So after thugs, it's going to be someone else [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=857.84s)]
*  and someone else. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=859.34s)]
*  Yeah, but you could be in jail for years if you don't testify. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=860.4399999999999s)]
*  So then he changed his mind, like I want to testify. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=862.54s)]
*  And then goes out there and then pleads a fifth. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=864.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=866.5799999999999s)]
*  So the judge ain't supposed to be helping you coerce nobody [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=867.6999999999999s)]
*  to testify or nothing like that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=870.04s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=871.3s)]
*  Yeah, prosecution can do that, but judges cannot, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and they've been doing way more dirty shit. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  They're like accidentally turning evidence [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=876.78s)]
*  late so that they don't have time to go over [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=879.6999999999999s)]
*  and keep getting away with all that little shit. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  Like she do all that little shit. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=885.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is my cousin Vinny. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=886.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, do you remember my cousin Vinny? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=888.56s)]
*  Like this is literally everything [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=889.8599999999999s)]
*  that happened in my cousin Vinny. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=891.06s)]
*  This is old school tricks. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=892.52s)]
*  Yeah, she's dirty, man. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=894.3s)]
*  OK, so he's going to get off, huh? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=895.42s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=896.78s)]
*  I mean, if he gets off, that's going to be one good story. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=897.84s)]
*  I think that case is going to be over. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=899.88s)]
*  It's going to be over this week, for sure. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=901.18s)]
*  This week? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=902.68s)]
*  What? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=903.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think tomorrow is when all these motions [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  get ruled on, motherfuckers going back and forth, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=907.42s)]
*  saying, you know, I want him gone, I want her gone. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=910.26s)]
*  He broke the law, she broke the law. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=912.9s)]
*  You got to understand, like she's [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=914.86s)]
*  against maybe like eight or nine other attorneys. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=917.26s)]
*  And they all just keep submitting motions. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=922.34s)]
*  You know, help me out with this. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm 40 and Indian. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=926.36s)]
*  Gunna, did he snitch or no? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=927.5400000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=928.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=929.46s)]
*  Because I'm not, I didn't even start panicking [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=930.5400000000001s)]
*  because I'm not even watching for the actual trial. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=932.64s)]
*  It's this side shit, like the judge and the prosecutor [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=936.7800000000001s)]
*  possibly getting thrown off the case, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=941.7800000000001s)]
*  that's the answer to shit because they dirty. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=943.22s)]
*  Which is wild because they probably, right? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=945.82s)]
*  Like I said, the YSL probably did it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=948.4200000000001s)]
*  But still, they breaking the law so they [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=952.86s)]
*  can put him in prison. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=954.72s)]
*  So what's your professional opinion? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=955.76s)]
*  What do you think the ruling's going to be? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=956.96s)]
*  What do I think it what? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  The ruling, like guilty, not guilty? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=959.36s)]
*  Oh, no, I think it's going to be a mistrial [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=961.36s)]
*  with prejudice, though, like where they're not [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=964.0600000000001s)]
*  going to be able to try him again. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=966.76s)]
*  Oh, mistrial with prejudice means they're trying him. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=968.24s)]
*  I think it's going to be a mistrial because the trial's [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=970.84s)]
*  already, it's already the longest-running trial [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=974.24s)]
*  in the history of Georgia. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=975.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=977.24s)]
*  And now the judge is gone. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=978.0400000000001s)]
*  So a new judge, it's like how could they possibly know [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=981.76s)]
*  enough about what's going on without going back [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=984.64s)]
*  through two years of transcripts? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=987.4s)]
*  How could they know enough about what's going on [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=989.3399999999999s)]
*  to like rule over the trial for it? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=990.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=993.14s)]
*  I mean, imagine you get selected for that case [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=994.38s)]
*  and then you have to go through two years of evidence, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=996.02s)]
*  information. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=999.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're not going to want to do all that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1000.4799999999999s)]
*  And all the money and all that shit, like. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1001.78s)]
*  And not to mention, like all the shit [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1003.66s)]
*  that was stricken from the record [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1005.26s)]
*  that you're not allowed to see. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1006.3599999999999s)]
*  So you got to go back and watch these videos, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1007.9599999999999s)]
*  but you can't watch the little pieces [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1009.94s)]
*  that were taken off the record. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1011.34s)]
*  It would just be a lot of complicated shit for them [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1013.98s)]
*  to actually give them a fair trial. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1016.1800000000001s)]
*  I think they're going to get thrown out. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1017.42s)]
*  So maybe that was the goal the whole time, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1019.08s)]
*  is just stretch this bitch out as long as fucking possible. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1021.26s)]
*  Wait for them to make a mistake. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1024.96s)]
*  But he's incarcerated the whole trial. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1026.26s)]
*  Better be incarcerated for this time now. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, for what he's been doing. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1030.06s)]
*  For 25 years. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  Because what they were going up again [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1032.66s)]
*  is attempted murder, right? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1034.14s)]
*  Or actual planning a murder. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1035.3s)]
*  The actual murder conspiracy. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1037.74s)]
*  Yeah, so you locked up for, that's 25, right? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1039.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1041.76s)]
*  He was going to be away for a while if he got that guilt [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1042.8s)]
*  on everything. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1044.8s)]
*  So if he does four or five now, that's a bargain. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1045.8s)]
*  Yeah, but still. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1048.1s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, really what you hoping [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1073.64s)]
*  is he get out before it's too late for his music [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1075.2s)]
*  to be relevant? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1078.88s)]
*  Oh, I mean, the comeback album is going to be crazy. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1080.48s)]
*  I think no matter what, he's going to be on fire. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1082.38s)]
*  Nah, that's when we thought that about Shine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1084.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, Shine also had been sent to Belize, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1087.42s)]
*  and he also lost the case. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1089.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1091.5800000000002s)]
*  He was convicted. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1092.48s)]
*  Shine went to jail for like 10 years. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1093.52s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1094.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  And now he's a politician out there. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  We talked about that yesterday. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1097.6599999999999s)]
*  We thought that about Bobby Schmurda. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1098.6599999999999s)]
*  But Schmurda came back. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  He didn't really have a hit. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1102.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't think he came back with music. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  Like, the music didn't hit. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1104.34s)]
*  I don't think he came back and his energy was crazy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1105.54s)]
*  All the streams were crazy. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1107.6799999999998s)]
*  He just didn't have the song that matched it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1109.02s)]
*  So you still got to make the music. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1111.02s)]
*  But Thug's a great artist. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1112.08s)]
*  Shine better than me. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1113.12s)]
*  I had a total on everybody. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1113.9199999999998s)]
*  That big still wants to. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1114.9199999999998s)]
*  Bro, Shine was so good, man. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  We were talking about him yesterday. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1117.3799999999999s)]
*  I thought he was the greatest voice. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1118.78s)]
*  Can you explain him to me? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1120.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm like, I have no. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1122.02s)]
*  His voice was just, I don't know. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1123.4199999999998s)]
*  Just, he was a rapper in what, Brooklyn? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1124.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1128.3s)]
*  He's from Brooklyn. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1129.1s)]
*  And he had a pretty iconic first video that came out. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1129.94s)]
*  Like, really cool voice. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1134.54s)]
*  None of us knew what the fuck Belize was. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1136.82s)]
*  We just thought he was this black dude. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1138.32s)]
*  Like, you know. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1139.68s)]
*  He sounded like Biggie. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1140.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1141.9199999999998s)]
*  But like, more. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1142.72s)]
*  But looks. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1143.52s)]
*  Yeah, just, he had like, great. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1144.32s)]
*  Everything was cooking. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  And then he's, you know, chilling with Diddy. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1147.4199999999998s)]
*  And then Diddy, him, and J-Lo are at this nightclub. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1149.1s)]
*  There's a shooting. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1152.36s)]
*  Somebody gets shot and killed. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1153.36s)]
*  Diddy kind of says to him, yo, my lawyers [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1154.52s)]
*  are going to take care of you. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1157.02s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1158.1200000000001s)]
*  And then his lawyers pin the murder on Shine. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1159.26s)]
*  Shine happens to be from Belize, even though he spent [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1161.3600000000001s)]
*  his entire life, I think, here in the United States. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1164.56s)]
*  He gets convicted and extradited to Belize. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1166.9s)]
*  He can never come back here. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1169.2s)]
*  He just recently came back because now he's [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1170.2s)]
*  a politician in Belize. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1172.5s)]
*  So he came on some sort of like, diplomatic trip. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1174.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1178.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1179.92s)]
*  So it's, anyway, this is at a time where, like, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1180.72s)]
*  Diddy is dating J-Lo. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1183.7s)]
*  He's this sweet guy running marathons for the vote. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1185.28s)]
*  Like, everybody loves Diddy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1187.98s)]
*  He's a teddy bear. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1189.64s)]
*  Now when you look back on it, you're like, whoa, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1191.04s)]
*  this is a nefarious individual that is trying to destroy [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1192.78s)]
*  the life of another human being when he was the one [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1197.02s)]
*  that was definitely a coward. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1199.18s)]
*  And Shine still won't say his name. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1200.22s)]
*  Ain't that crazy? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1201.66s)]
*  He still won't tell on him. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1202.46s)]
*  Ain't that crazy? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1203.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1204.76s)]
*  Think of the threats you must have gotten. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1205.76s)]
*  You're a politician in Belize, and you're still worried. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1207.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1209.5s)]
*  I don't think he's really scared. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1211.3s)]
*  I think it's just that street code shit of like, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1212.46s)]
*  if I tell him, because people don't care why you told. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1215.42s)]
*  They're like, nah, you a snitch. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1218.8000000000002s)]
*  I would have just been a snitch. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1221.5s)]
*  That's the only way to get revenge. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1223.1000000000001s)]
*  This nigga let me get locked up for 10 years. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1224.7s)]
*  I fuck all that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1226.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1227.14s)]
*  I'm ticketing on it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1227.94s)]
*  Can Thug get paid for the time he spent locked up? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1229.14s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1231.4s)]
*  Like, yo, it's a mistrial. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1233.0800000000002s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1234.94s)]
*  I was never found guilty, but I still [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1235.98s)]
*  lost three years of my life and all the music [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1237.38s)]
*  that I could have made and the money from the touring, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1239.18s)]
*  da, da, da, da, da. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1240.92s)]
*  No, that's an interesting point. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1241.94s)]
*  Like, can you keep somebody against their will? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1243.38s)]
*  You can't incarcerate somebody without cause, right? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1246.48s)]
*  Isn't that what habeas corpus is all about? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1249.6200000000001s)]
*  You can't hold someone's body without accusing them [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1251.42s)]
*  of a crime? I guess he is accused. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1253.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's accused. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1255.02s)]
*  So while you're accused, they can hold you? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1256.22s)]
*  There's no bail system? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1257.72s)]
*  No, because it's a dangerous crime. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1258.96s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1260.76s)]
*  They denied bail because it's a dangerous crime. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1262.0600000000002s)]
*  So they're holding him to protect the population. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1264.2s)]
*  I mean, that makes sense. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1268.0s)]
*  Like, you've got someone accused of rape or murder. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1269.2s)]
*  But you also have a right to a speedy trial. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1270.78s)]
*  So it's like a balance. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1273.76s)]
*  But that's another thing. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  And that county, it's many people that's just been [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1277.6200000000001s)]

*  no trial, haven't been charged with anything. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1283.9s)]
*  So they play the game. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1286.54s)]
*  They kind of muddy the motherfucking waters. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, they should let him go. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1291.38s)]
*  He's been locked up for two years, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1292.94s)]
*  and he hasn't been convicted of anything. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1294.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1296.38s)]
*  And is this their way of pushing you to accept [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1297.48s)]
*  a plea? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1299.1999999999998s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1300.3999999999999s)]
*  Accept a plea or coerce other people to snitch on you. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1301.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1305.04s)]

*  There's no reason to go to Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1313.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1315.2199999999998s)]
*  Because they dirty as shit over there. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=1316.32s)]

*  Wait, what did you do in the Marines? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2022.46s)]
*  He was deployed twice. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2023.72s)]

*  for, like, this rate for this giant radar. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2031.26s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2033.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2034.7s)]
*  Let me ask you a question about the Marines. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2035.7s)]
*  Is there, like, within the Marines [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2036.9s)]
*  a hierarchy of how much respect you get based on, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2038.0s)]
*  like, if you're a technician? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2039.94s)]
*  Like, JD Vance was, like, a war journalist or something? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2041.04s)]
*  It's all gay stuff. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2043.24s)]
*  But yeah, a journalist is like, you don't even got a gun. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2044.58s)]
*  You didn't even, you're not even in the armed forces. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  You're in the forces. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2049.02s)]
*  But you could get murked. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2050.38s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm curious, within that, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2052.54s)]
*  within the services, do they look at you? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2054.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, well, yeah, of course. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2056.02s)]
*  I think it's the same in all the services. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2057.08s)]
*  Like, do they look at you as a technician? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2058.38s)]
*  But the closer you are to danger... [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2059.7799999999997s)]
*  The higher you're ranked. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2060.98s)]
*  Right, but you probably usually are also [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2062.3199999999997s)]
*  not that intelligent. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2064.46s)]
*  So that's the only, that's really the only comeback [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2066.66s)]
*  you got. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2069.1s)]
*  Got it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2070.0s)]
*  Because we all think it's dumb. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  So the smartest... [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2071.66s)]
*  You're expendable. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2072.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2073.66s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2074.46s)]
*  So the smartest people are, like, the cooks? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2075.66s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2077.74s)]
*  Those are people that are dumb and pussies. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2079.7999999999997s)]

*  But you're not. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2086.7s)]
*  No, the Marine Corps don't have cooks, so... [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2088.08s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2091.24s)]
*  I think the Navy cooks for us. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2092.3399999999997s)]
*  Yo, get out of here. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2094.2799999999997s)]

*  I mean, maybe shit's different now, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2102.22s)]
*  but when I was in the, there was no cooks on the Marine Corps. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2103.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2106.06s)]

*  Dude. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2111.0200000000004s)]

*  I understand, like, okay, if you're a sniper, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2137.56s)]
*  I understand when, like, the field is level, right? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2140.06s)]
*  You're a sniper. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2143.3s)]
*  Athletically. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2144.1s)]
*  Technician. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2144.9s)]

*  Drone pilot. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2146.54s)]
*  All these things, absolutely. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2147.34s)]
*  But if it goes to, like, breaking down the door [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2148.94s)]
*  and potentially hand-to-hand combat [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2151.48s)]
*  and, like, actually carrying a heavy thing [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2153.18s)]
*  around the desert for a while, don't you just want dudes [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2155.68s)]
*  to do it because they have an advantage? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2159.22s)]
*  That's what I would want. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2161.18s)]
*  Son, if the other side saw me in the infantry, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2162.42s)]
*  I think they'd be like, America's over. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2164.12s)]
*  But I think, man, a lot of that training is so hard. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2165.7s)]
*  It's like... [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2168.88s)]
*  So weed them out. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2169.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, because it's definitely, listen, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2170.94s)]
*  it's definitely one or two or three women in there [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2172.92s)]
*  that can do all that same shit. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2175.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2177.72s)]
*  Yeah, because most of the dudes crying about it [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2178.8199999999997s)]
*  is dudes that couldn't pass the training anyway. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2180.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2183.12s)]
*  Do we get soldier steroids? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2184.12s)]
*  We should. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2186.12s)]
*  We should, bro. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2187.16s)]

*  That should be just part of it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2190.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2191.6s)]
*  I think so. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2192.4s)]
*  Like, why not? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2193.2s)]
*  Why not? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2194.18s)]
*  Like, every day you show up... [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  The Roy and the Rage could be... [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2196.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're ready. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2197.52s)]

*  They're ready to meet each other. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2199.56s)]
*  Mark had a good argument that they should give the people [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2200.72s)]
*  in the Special Olympics steroids. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2203.2s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2204.56s)]
*  I did not say that. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2205.6s)]
*  I think that makes them too powerful. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2206.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Mark said that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2208.0s)]
*  Isn't that too powerful? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2209.1s)]
*  I didn't say that, but he thinks that that's... [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2210.24s)]
*  They should be given. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2212.7s)]
*  If there's any Special Olympic athlete, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2213.9s)]
*  they should be allowed steroids to increase the amount. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2215.58s)]
*  Well, they should be allowed. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2218.3399999999997s)]
*  They should be allowed. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2219.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2220.38s)]
*  Yeah, why not? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2221.18s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2222.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it was like a level playing field. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2223.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2225.3s)]
*  Or what if you like activate the mutant genes? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2226.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2228.48s)]
*  But yeah, I think we have to see. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2229.6000000000004s)]
*  Has that been tested before? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2231.98s)]
*  No. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2233.38s)]
*  See, white people always playing guard. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2234.3s)]
*  No, I'm not juicing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2236.1200000000003s)]
*  When you're closest. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2237.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2239.38s)]
*  Man, we can't juice up our special needs kids, man. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2240.42s)]
*  Yeah, can't do it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2243.1200000000003s)]
*  It's too risky. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2244.1200000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2244.92s)]
*  We can't do it. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2245.78s)]
*  People in the Paralympics do it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2246.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2247.8s)]
*  There was a guy missing an arm that was like a slalom guy [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2248.46s)]
*  that got his medal revoked because he was juicing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2250.32s)]
*  He was juicing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2252.02s)]
*  They're all in such a disadvantage. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2252.82s)]
*  Just let them take whatever. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2254.5800000000004s)]
*  The rules should just be like, as long as you only inject [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2255.78s)]
*  in the nub, then you're good to go. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2257.86s)]
*  Apparently, it's a whole problem, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2260.98s)]
*  because there's some people with spinal cord [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2262.4s)]
*  injuries that need steroids in order to function. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2263.56s)]
*  It's basically medicinally prescribed. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2266.1400000000003s)]
*  And they're like, yo, I need this shit to live. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2268.06s)]
*  Let them do it. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2269.42s)]
*  See, I feel like, man, you had your chance, man. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2271.06s)]
*  You don't get to participate in the Olympics [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2275.98s)]
*  just because you want to. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2279.3s)]
*  Like, yo, you recover from spinal cord? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2281.5s)]
*  That's kind of what I feel. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2282.86s)]
*  It's like, we don't owe you that, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2283.94s)]
*  because it would be a great story. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2285.14s)]
*  Like, you're like, oh, I hurt myself, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2287.18s)]
*  and I climbed all the way back to the top. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2288.7400000000002s)]
*  I should be able to do steroids so I can be in the Olympics. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2291.06s)]
*  Well, why? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2293.82s)]
*  Well, this is para. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2295.14s)]
*  This is para. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2295.82s)]
*  You're saying? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2296.98s)]
*  Oh, it's people that's paralyzed. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2297.78s)]
*  No, no, Paralympics. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2298.98s)]
*  Wow, I went on a long rant for nothing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2300.1s)]
*  There's been a couple people that do both, like Pistorius. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2303.06s)]
*  He was a legendary one. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2305.42s)]
*  Right, that was OK. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2307.06s)]
*  The dude with the bendable leg. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2308.26s)]
*  He did Paralympics, crushed everyone. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2309.58s)]
*  Did he kill somebody? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2311.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2312.14s)]
*  That's why. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2312.94s)]
*  That whole other thing. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2313.74s)]
*  Probably because he was doing steroids. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2314.74s)]
*  Yo, low key. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2316.4199999999996s)]
*  Who did he kill? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2318.94s)]
*  His girlfriend. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2319.98s)]
*  His girlfriend. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2320.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2321.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2322.2999999999997s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2322.7799999999997s)]
*  That whole thing was wild. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2323.58s)]
*  Unless he didn't get found guilty. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2324.62s)]
*  I mean, he did. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2326.3399999999997s)]
*  He got found guilty of culpable manslaughter. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2327.2599999999998s)]
*  You don't buy it? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2329.98s)]
*  He shot up into a door. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2330.98s)]
*  Culpable manslaughter. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2332.22s)]
*  He shot into a bathroom door where she was, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2333.8599999999997s)]
*  so it's not like there was a big space. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2335.8999999999996s)]
*  He thought someone was robbing the place. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2337.74s)]
*  And also taking a shit. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2339.3799999999997s)]
*  And you're in the restroom right now. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2341.6600000000003s)]
*  And also, yeah, arguing with him about domestic things. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2344.6200000000003s)]
*  Was she pregnant? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2349.26s)]
*  No. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2350.6600000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2351.3s)]
*  It was on Valentine's Day, I believe. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2352.42s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2354.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2354.94s)]
*  God damn, you suck. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2355.5s)]
*  You can't be nice for one day. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2356.9s)]
*  You can't kill her on the 15th. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2358.94s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2360.5s)]
*  You wouldn't break up with a girl on Valentine's Day. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2361.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2363.26s)]
*  That would be too far. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2363.7400000000002s)]
*  So he got found guilty. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2364.54s)]
*  What'd he get? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2365.38s)]
*  What'd they give him? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2366.1400000000003s)]
*  They gave him 10 years, I think. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2366.82s)]
*  And he, I think it was a longer sentence, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2368.1s)]
*  but some of it got commuted. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2370.74s)]
*  He actually just got released. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2371.86s)]
*  I think they gave him 10 years and took his legs for 20. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2372.66s)]
*  20. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2374.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, just punishment. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2375.58s)]
*  He got released, though. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2377.02s)]
*  I think he's back. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2377.94s)]
*  We got to get him on the pot. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2379.98s)]
*  He's around. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2381.22s)]
*  He's wheeling around now. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2382.62s)]
*  I would talk to him about that experience. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2383.54s)]
*  January 1st, 2024. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2385.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2386.46s)]
*  He's a computer. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2388.02s)]
*  You got to fight. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2388.94s)]
*  Put the leg to stand on jokes. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2389.74s)]
*  I mean, a lot of those would go, but now those jokes can fly. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2392.1s)]
*  Yeah, because he killed somebody. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2395.18s)]
*  Like, you guys have no empathy. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2396.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2398.58s)]
*  So he has a really interesting story, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2399.5s)]
*  and we can make fun of him as much as we want, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2401.58s)]
*  because he did something really bad in his life. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2403.5s)]
*  He really did. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2406.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2407.26s)]
*  Apparently, I was looking into it. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2408.06s)]
*  Even if it wasn't his girlfriend, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2409.58s)]
*  even if it was an intruder that was stealing shit [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2410.94s)]
*  and also took a shit in the middle of it, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2413.14s)]
*  he still would have been found guilty. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2414.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2416.7s)]
*  Because I don't think you could just, like, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2417.06s)]
*  shoot through a door without knowing what's behind it [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2418.22s)]
*  in South Africa, where he was at the time the crime took place. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2420.86s)]
*  I mean, I would imagine there's, like, pretty good self-defense [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2423.34s)]
*  laws out there. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2425.82s)]
*  So apparently, his house got robbed before, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2427.2599999999998s)]
*  and he was, like, kind of, like, a little anxious [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2429.18s)]
*  about getting robbed. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2431.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2432.42s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure if I got into a fight with my wife, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2433.22s)]
*  I'd be like, someone is robbing me in the bathroom? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2438.74s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2439.94s)]
*  Sounds like an intruder's here. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2440.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2442.2599999999998s)]
*  That's a great excuse. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2443.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2444.18s)]
*  And apparently, he had to cross her side of the bed [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2444.7799999999997s)]
*  in order to get to the bathroom. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2446.8199999999997s)]
*  And there was nobody there. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2448.22s)]
*  And he didn't think, whatever. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2449.54s)]
*  Did he put his legs on first? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2452.02s)]
*  No. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2454.5s)]
*  So this was contested. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2455.42s)]
*  This was a part of the whole trial. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2457.46s)]
*  Because that is important. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2459.6600000000003s)]
*  And so I think the prosecution was saying that he did put [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2460.78s)]
*  his legs on to prove premeditation. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2463.3s)]
*  But I think they were able to prove that the bullet holes [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2465.54s)]
*  were going up. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2468.38s)]
*  No. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2469.3s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2470.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2471.1000000000004s)]
*  I looked at it, and they were like, yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2473.9s)]
*  So I think they confirmed that he didn't put his legs on. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2475.86s)]
*  Which would also indicate, like, he was panicked. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2478.2200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2480.58s)]
*  Like, he just hopped out of bed thinking [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2481.1000000000004s)]
*  someone was in there, crawled, army crawl. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2482.54s)]
*  Furthermore, he's vulnerable. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2484.46s)]
*  Killing with that odd job. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2485.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2486.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2487.7s)]
*  But yeah, legendary Olympic moment right there. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2488.5s)]
*  God damn. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2491.62s)]
*  That was it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2492.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2493.2200000000003s)]
*  But I feel like, do you think people would be surprised [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2494.02s)]
*  if you killed your wife? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2495.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2497.34s)]
*  Like, we woke up in the morning, it was like, Andrew snapped [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2498.34s)]
*  and fucking threw his wife out the window with a hand. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2500.94s)]
*  I would be shocked. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2502.66s)]
*  Would have cost me, like, no way. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2503.46s)]
*  Yeah, he would be like, no way. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2504.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2506.2200000000003s)]
*  Unless it was, unless he heard it [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2507.02s)]
*  right before the podcast started. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2509.06s)]
*  Unless, unless the conversation right before this podcast [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2511.82s)]
*  began, happened, and then he heard the information, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2516.26s)]
*  then I think it would be quite believable. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2519.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2520.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2521.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2522.1800000000003s)]
*  But outside of that, no. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2522.98s)]
*  I don't think anybody would believe me. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2523.78s)]
*  I'm being honest. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2524.5800000000004s)]
*  I can't think of a person I know who would kill their wives [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2525.38s)]
*  and I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2527.34s)]
*  No? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2528.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2529.5800000000004s)]
*  Who are you thinking that you're like, I can see it? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2530.38s)]
*  Damn, see, I don't want to thought [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2536.98s)]
*  like they're missing the street. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2537.94s)]
*  But you got someone in mind. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2539.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2540.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, for public safety, you should. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2542.06s)]
*  No, no, no, fuck you. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2544.42s)]
*  What? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2545.78s)]
*  He's like, I ain't no snitch. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2546.58s)]
*  I need to know that I could actually look at this guy funny. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2548.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, just believe it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2551.3s)]
*  Have you not tried to intervene? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2553.02s)]
*  Would I intervene? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2555.06s)]
*  Like, have you not tried to, like, if you think, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2555.86s)]
*  if he's going to kill a girl and you're not, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2557.42s)]
*  you wouldn't be surprised. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2559.02s)]
*  No, no, no, I don't think he's gonna, but I'm saying, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2559.78s)]
*  but if I heard that he did, I would be like, no way. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2561.3s)]
*  Is it because of the relationship [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2563.58s)]
*  or because of who he is as a human? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2564.46s)]
*  Because of who he is as a human. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2565.74s)]
*  Uh. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2567.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2568.38s)]
*  You don't know nobody like that? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2569.18s)]
*  No, y'all are all just friends with the best. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2570.22s)]
*  Who thinks you can say that? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2572.02s)]
*  Yeah, no one that I think is a murderer. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2572.8599999999997s)]
*  Also, I love how, like, in order to not murder your wife, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2574.3799999999997s)]
*  you gotta be the best. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2578.98s)]
*  You be the best. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2579.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2580.66s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2581.4599999999996s)]
*  That's his bar. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2582.2999999999997s)]
*  Only the cream of the crop doesn't kill their wives. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2583.1s)]
*  I mean, I've met a couple people I think are probably dangerous. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2586.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2588.98s)]
*  And so I'm like, I wouldn't be shocked in that regard. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2589.7799999999997s)]
*  I'd better kick my mom's ass, and I still [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2591.8599999999997s)]
*  wouldn't think he would kill her. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2594.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2595.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2596.2999999999997s)]
*  That's a giant leap, dog. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2597.18s)]
*  I'm starting to think that's why you don't want to get mad. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2599.1s)]
*  Is that why you single, brother? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2602.74s)]
*  He's like, I know what I'm kidding. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2604.3399999999997s)]
*  No, that's not that big of a leap. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2605.38s)]
*  If they would beat their ass, you don't think they would kill him? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2606.86s)]
*  I actually think it proves the opposite. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2609.1s)]
*  That's kind of a good point. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2612.2599999999998s)]
*  Really, like I'm showing restraint? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2613.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2614.46s)]
*  It's like there's proof that this is as far as I'm free on him. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2615.2599999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2619.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2619.7s)]
*  Well, I guess I gotta retake my damn heart [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2620.5s)]
*  on the whole class or whatever. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2624.2599999999998s)]
*  Are you capable of killing your future wife? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2625.62s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2628.38s)]
*  Let's focus here. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2629.58s)]
*  Who's the person? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2630.58s)]
*  Yeah, who's the person? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2631.38s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2632.42s)]
*  Just blank it. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2633.42s)]
*  We'll bleep it. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2634.22s)]
*  We just want to know. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2635.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2636.42s)]
*  You don't trust us to bleep it? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2637.22s)]
*  Well, absolutely bleep it. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2640.46s)]
*  But I don't have to trust you, because I'm not going to tell you. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2641.9s)]
*  But that means that you don't trust me. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=2644.2599999999998s)]

*  That would have been like a fantastic reveal live in the movie. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3149.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3154.22s)]
*  Like, let us find out in the fucking movie. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3156.22s)]
*  Now, it's a ballsy move because you got to pay him 50 million or whatever the fuck he needs for a movie. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3158.22s)]
*  And then you're not even using him in a promo. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3162.22s)]
*  But once that got out, did Robert Downey Jr. is Dr. Doom? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3164.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3169.22s)]
*  It would have been cool. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3170.22s)]
*  But I think after a whole comic con, that's the only big news? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3171.22s)]
*  That's the thing, because it's over, bro. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3174.22s)]
*  All the stories are sold. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3177.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wrap. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3179.22s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3181.22s)]
*  You guys know Fume. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3182.22s)]
*  I've talked about Fume for months. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3183.22s)]
*  I think it's absolutely fantastic. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3185.22s)]
*  The flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading alternative to vaping and smoking. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3187.22s)]
*  People are realizing that vaping and smoking, it is not worth it. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3191.22s)]
*  Yes, we still like the indulgence. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3195.22s)]
*  You want to take a puff of something and inhale of something, Fume has got your back. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3197.22s)]
*  It's a whole new movement towards better habits, led by literally the sponsor of today's podcast, Fume. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3202.22s)]
*  You guys already know about them. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3208.22s)]

*  They got the orange, they have vanilla. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3228.22s)]
*  They got a bunch of different flavors. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3229.22s)]
*  I like the mint. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3230.22s)]
*  I like it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3231.22s)]

*  He really don't miss. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3269.22s)]
*  He don't miss. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3270.22s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3274.22s)]
*  Multiple times. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3275.22s)]
*  Yeah, I can't think of any names. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3276.22s)]

*  Jackie Brown. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3281.22s)]
*  Now... [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3282.22s)]
*  Pulp Fiction. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3283.22s)]
*  What's top three for you of Tarantino? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3284.22s)]
*  Pulp Fiction. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3294.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3295.22s)]
*  Hateful Eight. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3299.22s)]
*  Hateful Eight? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3300.22s)]
*  I never saw that one actually. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3301.22s)]
*  That's good. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3303.22s)]
*  That's one of my favorite ones. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3304.22s)]
*  I didn't fuck with Hateful Eight that much. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3305.22s)]
*  And Glorious Basses. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3309.22s)]
*  Glorious Basses was good, bro. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3310.22s)]
*  Glorious Basses was good. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3311.22s)]
*  Channing Tatum. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3314.22s)]
*  Western. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3315.22s)]
*  Morgan Freeman. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3316.22s)]
*  Samuel L. Jackson. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3317.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3318.22s)]
*  Oh damn, but what about Django? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3319.22s)]
*  Django. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3320.22s)]
*  No, Django went. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3321.22s)]
*  Django went. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3322.22s)]
*  Yeah, I had to throw Django. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3323.22s)]
*  I had to throw Django. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3324.22s)]
*  Kill Bill, Django, and then I don't know what my third is. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3325.22s)]

*  Oh, Kill Bill? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3329.22s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3330.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3331.22s)]
*  Bro, that's tough, bro. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3332.22s)]
*  You know, credit to Tarantino. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3333.22s)]
*  Like, you make a movie. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3334.22s)]
*  It is Reservoir... [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3335.22s)]
*  Wait, who was first? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3336.22s)]
*  Reservoir Dogs? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3337.22s)]
*  Reservoir Dogs. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3338.22s)]
*  Reservoir Dogs, then Pulp Fiction. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3339.22s)]
*  Then Pulp Fiction. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3340.22s)]
*  So you made two movies. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3341.22s)]
*  But actually True Romance, I think, came before... [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3342.22s)]
*  Wait, he did True Romance? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3344.22s)]
*  He wrote it, yeah. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3345.22s)]
*  But he didn't direct? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3346.22s)]
*  No, I don't think he directed it. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3347.22s)]
*  So you do those two, and then you can pretty much do whatever you want in Hollywood. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3348.22s)]
*  And I think most dudes in that situation, they get scooped up by some huge movie studio. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3352.22s)]
*  And they're like, yo, do the next Superman, yo, do the next this. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3358.22s)]
*  And he was like, how about I don't do that? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3361.22s)]
*  How about I just keep on making the movies I want to make? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3364.22s)]
*  And then that shit worked out. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3366.22s)]
*  It's hard to not be seduced. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3368.22s)]
*  And I remember people were upset at Jackie Brown because they expected Pulp Fiction again. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3369.22s)]
*  Got a whole different movie. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3373.22s)]
*  They didn't understand this is what he's going to do. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3374.22s)]
*  He's going to dip into a bunch of different genres. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3375.22s)]
*  And then he probably led a lot of other people to fail thinking they could do the same shit. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3377.22s)]
*  It's like, no. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3381.22s)]
*  Yeah, not everybody got it like him. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3382.22s)]
*  Nah, you can't do it like that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3384.22s)]
*  You got to do some of the bullshit before you can do what you want to do. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3385.22s)]
*  I loved Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, too. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3388.22s)]
*  I think a lot of people didn't like it. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3389.22s)]
*  I thought that shit was fire. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3391.22s)]
*  My favorite train of train of train movie is always just the last one I saw. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3392.22s)]
*  That good. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3395.22s)]
*  What about Death Proof? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3396.22s)]
*  No. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3397.22s)]
*  Death Proof is so underrated. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3398.22s)]
*  I never saw that. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3399.22s)]
*  I never saw it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3400.22s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3401.22s)]
*  So he did a double feature thing, grindhouse thing with what's his name, with Dyltero's [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3402.22s)]
*  brother. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3409.22s)]
*  No, Robert Rodriguez. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3410.22s)]
*  Robert Rodriguez. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3411.22s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3412.22s)]
*  So Death Proof was his movie and then Something Dead was a zombie movie. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3413.22s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3419.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3421.22s)]
*  The shit that... [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3422.22s)]
*  It's not Dust Till Dawn, right? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3424.22s)]
*  Dust Till Dawn. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3425.22s)]
*  No, no, it wasn't Dust Till Dawn. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3426.22s)]
*  No. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3427.22s)]
*  He was in Dust Till Dawn. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3428.22s)]
*  He was in it, but just a different thing. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3429.22s)]
*  Robert Rodriguez directed it, but I think he was in it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3430.22s)]
*  Planetary, yeah. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3432.22s)]
*  Planetary, honestly. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3433.22s)]
*  So they did a double feature, like it came out together as one thing. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3434.22s)]
*  But Planetary was first and it's like this fast-paced action-packed thing and Death Proof [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3437.22s)]
*  is kind of like a slow... [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3442.98s)]
*  You would literally go to the theater and it would be two movies. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3444.22s)]
*  And then you would watch back to back. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3446.22s)]
*  Nah, that's crazy. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3448.22s)]
*  Yeah, and then Death Proof is super underrated. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3449.22s)]
*  It might be one of his best ones, too. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3451.22s)]
*  Do you think going to the movies is done? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3453.22s)]
*  No. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3457.22s)]
*  What do you see the future of that? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3458.22s)]
*  No, no, no, because you can't get rid of that communal... [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3460.22s)]
*  Because there's part of you that you check in with people. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3463.22s)]
*  You want to feel other people around you when you're watching something. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3467.22s)]
*  Think about all your top moments of watching a movie. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3470.22s)]
*  Top Gun, Maverick. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3475.22s)]
*  It was with other people. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3476.22s)]
*  Even if it's not in the theater, it's like that group feeling of like we all... [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3477.22s)]
*  It's almost like having a good meal. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3481.22s)]
*  You have a good meal with the homies. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3483.22s)]
*  When it's done, you have that feeling of satisfaction. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3485.22s)]
*  I don't need 300 people watching it, but I do like... [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3487.22s)]
*  I mean, Game of Thrones is a perfect example. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3490.22s)]
*  Even Breaking Bad, when shit builds to the point where every week it's important, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3492.22s)]
*  it becomes a communal viewing experience. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3497.22s)]
*  Yo, let's all get together. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3500.22s)]
*  It's like watching a pay-per-view fight. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3501.22s)]
*  It's like, let's watch this shit together. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3502.22s)]
*  I want to be able to... [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3504.22s)]
*  I want to see the knockout and then I want to look at you [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3506.22s)]
*  and see you reacting the way I'm reacting to that fucking knockout. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3508.22s)]
*  But we don't do that with just entertainment. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3512.22s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3514.22s)]
*  No, it's like... [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3515.22s)]
*  I don't think every movie justifies that communal experience. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3516.22s)]
*  It needs to be Nolan, Tarantino, Spielberg. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3520.22s)]
*  Cameron, maybe. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3524.22s)]
*  Yeah, James Cameron did it with the Avatar shit. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3526.22s)]
*  I don't even fuck with Avatar, but it was so just mind-boggling that the world was created. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3529.22s)]
*  He's another one. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3535.22s)]
*  He's got hands too. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3536.22s)]
*  Aliens was crazy, apparently. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3537.22s)]
*  It was before Time Terminator. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3539.22s)]
*  Terminator 2 was insane. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3540.22s)]
*  I also like the... [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3542.22s)]
*  Titanic. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3543.22s)]
*  He's crazy enough. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3544.22s)]
*  Avatar. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3545.22s)]
*  This is making me feel dizzy. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3546.22s)]
*  What, you got to take it out every once in a while. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3548.22s)]
*  Oh, word. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3550.22s)]
*  I do. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3551.22s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3552.22s)]
*  Take that shit out now. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3553.22s)]
*  Swallow me like gum. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3554.22s)]
*  You ever rip one before? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3555.22s)]
*  No. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3557.22s)]
*  What's that do? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3558.22s)]
*  No, I'm saying you never pull one out. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3559.22s)]
*  This is your first time doing a zent. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3560.22s)]
*  No, he must have done a zent. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3562.22s)]
*  No, I mean, maybe I've done tried one, but tried something else not a zent though. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3563.22s)]
*  Yeah, take that shit out. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3567.22s)]
*  It's just nicotine. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3568.22s)]
*  Okay, why do you have to take it out every now and then? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3569.22s)]
*  I do because I don't smoke cigarettes or nothing, so it's just like... [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3571.22s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3573.22s)]
*  Yeah, you just keep getting nicotine delivered to you, and you're dizzy, and I keep telling you to take it out, and you keep just keeping it in. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3574.22s)]
*  Okay, because now I feel like you're challenging me. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3580.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3582.22s)]
*  Now I feel like you're like, oh, bitch. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3583.22s)]
*  I knew the second that we said take it out that that shit wasn't ever leaving his body. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3584.22s)]
*  Yeah, dawg. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3588.22s)]
*  Come on. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3589.22s)]
*  I mean, bro, if you saw the edible I ate before I walked in here, you'd be like, man, that dude's...he's really rolling a dice. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3590.22s)]
*  You like edible high that much? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3596.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, no, actually, I ate one last night to go to sleep, and it was the wrong...it was too much. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3598.22s)]
*  And then I woke up this morning, and I kind of...I was like too high still, so I was like...you know how you do like the hair of the dog? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3606.22s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3614.22s)]
*  You get back after it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3615.22s)]
*  Yeah, you get a little good...yeah, stay... [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3616.22s)]
*  So I remember when we were in Portland, and we ate them fucking gummies. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3619.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3622.22s)]
*  And I thought that the lamp in the green room was the Pixar joint. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3623.22s)]
*  I started acting out the Pixar lamp. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3628.22s)]
*  I was so depressed after that weekend, bro. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3632.22s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3634.22s)]
*  It was like...whatever reason, like... [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3635.22s)]
*  We can do the same differently. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3639.22s)]
*  Yeah, that shit...like Molly, I maybe had a little down on it or whatever like that. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3641.22s)]
*  I did that Coke one time in Burning Man, and I felt a little down the next day, but nothing makes me feel more down the next day than weed. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3646.22s)]
*  I agree, I agree. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3653.22s)]
*  That shit... [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3655.22s)]
*  I feel a little hangover right now. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3656.22s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3658.22s)]
*  I'm just like so depleted. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3659.22s)]
*  I have so much fun, but I'm taking out that loan on tomorrow's fund. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3660.22s)]
*  I don't think I feel that with Shrooms. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3665.22s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3667.22s)]
*  Oh no, Shrooms take it out of me too. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3668.22s)]
*  I can't. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3670.22s)]
*  I should fuck that. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3671.22s)]
*  I mean everything kind of...but now I'm at that point where I know what drugs I like and how much I can get away with. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3672.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3679.22s)]
*  Yeah, I won't be getting fucked up by accident and shit. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3680.22s)]
*  That's a little kid shit. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3682.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3683.22s)]
*  You just got too high last night. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3684.22s)]
*  No, but too high, no, not really. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3685.22s)]
*  I just never heard like Hair of the Dog for weed. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3688.22s)]
*  That's dead. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3692.22s)]
*  Well, I mean I'm sure we have a different name. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3693.22s)]
*  We can make one up. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3695.22s)]
*  It does work with alcohol though, I'm not going to lie. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3696.22s)]
*  Being hungover and then you start drinking again, you have that moment where you're like, oh I'm back. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3701.22s)]
*  And then ten years later your whole family left you and you're just sleeping under a bridge. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3708.22s)]
*  Hair of the Dog is like going to the ATM at the casino. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3713.22s)]
*  I'll get it back this time. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3716.22s)]
*  Yeah, but I'll do it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3718.22s)]
*  You ever do DMT? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3721.22s)]
*  No, man. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3722.22s)]
*  It's so funny because I thought that because I feel like I'm close enough to Joe Rogan where I should be able to get it easy and I just can't. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3723.22s)]
*  What do you mean you can't? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3735.22s)]
*  Can you ask Rogan right now, can I do some DMT and he got you easy? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3736.22s)]
*  Oh, maybe. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3740.22s)]
*  Maybe not. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3741.22s)]
*  I haven't had some directly. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3742.22s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3744.22s)]
*  But I thought it would just be around. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3746.22s)]
*  Just be around. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3749.22s)]
*  Just not. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3752.22s)]
*  But actually what is going on though? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3754.22s)]
*  What actually is going on right now? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3756.22s)]
*  What is happening, bro? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3759.22s)]
*  Bro, your grandma just passed. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3761.22s)]
*  She took DMT. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3763.22s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3765.22s)]
*  Is that how you think it works? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3767.22s)]
*  No, I just thought eventually it would. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3769.22s)]
*  Someone just bring it to mothership. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3771.22s)]
*  I'm boys with a son. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3773.22s)]
*  I thought I'd be Muslim by now. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3774.22s)]
*  Turns out they didn't ask me. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3776.22s)]
*  But I have had more lamb than I have had before. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3778.22s)]
*  Since knowing him. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3782.22s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3784.22s)]
*  Sometimes it's just me lambing around because I know him. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3785.22s)]
*  You feel what I'm saying? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3788.22s)]
*  So that friendship brought lamb into your life in a different way. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3789.22s)]
*  You're not as close to Joe as you thought, bro. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3792.22s)]
*  Now with Rogan, that's the like, you've probably done work. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3795.22s)]
*  I don't hunt, but since I've known him. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3800.22s)]
*  You shot a bow. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3802.22s)]
*  I shot a bow, nigga. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3803.22s)]
*  I've seen like dehydrated, yeah, elk pieces, nigga. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3804.22s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen different sorts of smokers. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3809.22s)]
*  And none of this shit, I saw it. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3812.22s)]
*  So I thought every now and then I would be like, hey, what's this right here? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3814.22s)]
*  They're like, DMT. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3818.22s)]
*  Certain things you don't just leave around though. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3820.22s)]
*  That's true. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3823.22s)]
*  That's true. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3824.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3825.22s)]
*  It's a crazy expectation I have. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3826.22s)]
*  I mean, I really got to admit that. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3828.22s)]
*  But you wouldn't try it though. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3831.22s)]
*  Of course. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3833.22s)]
*  I would try it if I found it. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3834.22s)]
*  I would try it. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3836.22s)]
*  I've been trying to try it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3837.22s)]
*  But you know, it's something that our boy Poston, shout out Derrick Poston. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3839.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's the homie right there. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3843.22s)]
*  So I was asking Derrick, I was like, listen, we got Simpson coming on. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3845.22s)]
*  And tell me some stuff about Brian. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3849.22s)]
*  I just need to know some things about him. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3853.22s)]
*  And this is how I would distill the conversation. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3855.22s)]
*  That justice, social justice, not like in terms of rights for Asians or whatever, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3859.22s)]
*  but social interactive justice is very important to you. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3865.22s)]
*  I go, what do you mean by that? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3870.22s)]
*  He goes, for example, we were going to the movies one time [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3872.22s)]
*  and Brian has the Fastpass in the movies. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3875.22s)]
*  And there's a line for the Fastpass and there's a line for regulars. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3879.22s)]
*  And if they take a regular before you, you're shutting down the movie theater. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3883.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm paying extra for. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3889.22s)]
*  Most people would be like, you know what, I'm not going to make a scene. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3892.22s)]
*  Now this is my policy. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3895.22s)]
*  Like I do the same thing in the airport. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3896.22s)]
*  Okay, go on. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3898.22s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3899.22s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't take nothing for me to be like, excuse me, ma'am, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3900.22s)]
*  you know you're not dancing medallion. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3902.22s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3904.22s)]
*  I'm diamond medallion. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3906.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3907.22s)]
*  I'm diamond medallion. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3908.22s)]
*  You know that. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3909.22s)]
*  I remember we were at like, was it Uchi or some shit? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3910.22s)]
*  No, what was the Japanese part? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3913.22s)]
*  It was Uchi? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3915.22s)]
*  We were in Austin, we were in Uchi. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3916.22s)]
*  And I remember the waiter wasn't bringing enough water or something like that. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3917.22s)]
*  And there was a moment where you were like, yeah, I don't know how much more of this. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3923.22s)]
*  The best moment, the best moment, Brian. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3931.22s)]
*  You remember? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3934.22s)]
*  You remember? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3935.22s)]
*  You were like, yeah, there's something going on here. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3936.22s)]
*  I don't know how much more of it I could deal with. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3938.22s)]
*  He's in the middle of telling a story and the waiter in the middle of his story comes [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3941.22s)]
*  over and goes, excuse me, sir, would you like a glass of wine also? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3944.22s)]
*  And Brian just looks over the waiter and goes, yes, please. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3946.22s)]
*  The waiter walks away. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3950.22s)]
*  He just keeps staring into space where the waiter used to be, just staring off. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3951.22s)]
*  Just looks back at the table like, what the fuck was that? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3955.22s)]
*  I might just be foreboding by accident, nigga. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3958.22s)]
*  Trying to stare niggas down. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3961.22s)]
*  But I know I get irritated easily by social ineptitude and competence. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3963.22s)]
*  Like I need things to make sense, which I know is kind of tough in being in show business. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3972.22s)]
*  You've got to kind of fight that. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3977.22s)]
*  Explain that. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3979.22s)]
*  Sometimes things ain't going to make sense. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3980.22s)]
*  If you need everything to make sense to you or be fair or whatever, you're going to be miserable. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3982.22s)]
*  So I'm also good at letting shit go. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3987.22s)]
*  But like, when it comes to certain stuff that don't make sense, I'm just like. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3990.22s)]
*  You're on an airplane. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3994.22s)]
*  You're about to get off and the people behind you try to get off before you. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3995.22s)]
*  What happens? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=3999.22s)]
*  I'm not having it. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4000.22s)]
*  And what are you going to do? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4001.22s)]
*  I'm stepping out of the aisle. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4002.22s)]
*  I do that. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4004.22s)]
*  I put the bag in the aisle. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4005.22s)]
*  Yeah, you know it's not your turn. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4007.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4008.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4009.22s)]
*  Because people will try you. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4010.22s)]
*  Because if you fly enough, you know that people will, they will use, try to use. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4011.22s)]
*  Your kindness. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4017.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4018.22s)]
*  The fact that you don't want to cause a scene, they'll use that against you. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4019.22s)]
*  So they'll be sitting in your seat and shit. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4021.22s)]
*  Oh, I was just wondering if you wanted to switch. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4023.22s)]
*  Well, you should have asked me before you sat right there. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4025.22s)]
*  So fuck you and your whole situation. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4027.22s)]
*  Because whatever story you got from me, I ain't trying to hear it. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4029.22s)]
*  I know, there's a hundred times. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4032.22s)]
*  Mike, but my child. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4033.22s)]
*  Fuck your child. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4034.22s)]
*  Now, if they ask after you sat down, is it different? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4036.22s)]
*  It is different. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4040.22s)]
*  It's still going to be a no, probably. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4041.22s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4043.22s)]
*  But I'm not going to be rude. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4044.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4045.22s)]
*  But I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm sorry, I don't switch. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4046.22s)]
*  What if you're in my situation that happened a couple months ago? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4048.22s)]
*  What was your situation? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4050.22s)]
*  I'm sitting there. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4052.22s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4053.22s)]
*  I get onto an airplane. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4054.22s)]
*  This is fantastic. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4055.22s)]
*  And I have an aisle seat and there's an old man in the middle seat and then my friend Dove [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4056.22s)]
*  is sitting in the window seat. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4060.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4061.22s)]
*  So we all get on, Dove goes into the window seat, the old man in the middle. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4062.22s)]
*  So you're, you're. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4065.22s)]
*  He is selected in aisle seat. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4066.22s)]
*  You're in a three person room. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4068.22s)]
*  Yes, three person room. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4070.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4071.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4072.22s)]
*  Remember those days? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4073.22s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4074.22s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4075.22s)]
*  Why do you have to say it like that? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4076.22s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4077.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4078.22s)]
*  Damn. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4079.22s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4080.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in the back. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4081.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4082.22s)]
*  He already can't relate to your struggles. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4083.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4084.22s)]
*  But maybe you can give some advice. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4085.22s)]
*  So you already started with poor choices. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4086.22s)]
*  So the guy stands up and he looks old as fuck, bro. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4087.72s)]
*  He's so old. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4090.72s)]
*  And so he stands up and he's in the aisle and I sit, Dove goes in and he sits in the [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4091.72s)]
*  middle and he leans over. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4095.3599999999997s)]
*  He's like, excuse me, sir. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4096.36s)]
*  I just got back surgery. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4097.98s)]
*  My whole back is just so fucked up. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4099.219999999999s)]

*  He was spry, didn't go to the bathroom one time and he even leans over me. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4133.5s)]
*  And he's like, by the way, I didn't have back surgery. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4136.42s)]
*  I just wanted to get an aisle seat. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4140.22s)]

*  They also sell mattresses, but they also sell this mattress cover, which I think is actually genius. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4375.7s)]
*  Because some people love their mattress. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4379.7s)]
*  I like my mattress, but I still want the benefits of the adjusting temperature. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4381.7s)]
*  This is gonna help me get into REM sleep faster. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4384.7s)]
*  It's gonna help me have more efficient sleep. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4387.7s)]
*  That is what is most valuable to me. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4389.7s)]
*  8 Sleep is literally, it's a genius piece of technology. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4392.7s)]
*  And if you don't want to invest in one of their mattresses, I get that piece. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4395.7s)]
*  You don't know if it works. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4399.7s)]
*  Once it works, you might be like, all right, I'm all in. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4400.7s)]
*  All I want is everything 8 Sleep. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4402.7s)]
*  But what they do have is this mattress cover. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4403.7s)]
*  It's called the Pod 4 Ultra. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4405.7s)]
*  It cools, it heats, and now it even elevates automatically. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4407.7s)]
*  It is also clinically proven to give you up to one hour more of quality sleep every night. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4411.7s)]
*  I cannot even begin to explain how important that is. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4415.7s)]
*  If you look at any of these longevity scientists or doctors, what do they say the most important thing is? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4417.7s)]
*  Sleep. What if you get one more hour a day? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4422.7s)]
*  That's probably years on your life, and 8 Sleep is gonna help you do that. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4424.7s)]
*  If you snore, the Pod can detect your snoring and automatically lift your head by a few degrees to improve airflow and stop your or your partner's snoring. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4428.7s)]
*  This is incredible. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4438.7s)]
*  Plus, the Pod 4 Ultra can leave your wearables on the nightstand. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4439.7s)]
*  It's integrated and in perceptible sensors. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4444.7s)]
*  Track your sleep time, sleep phases. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4447.7s)]
*  You don't even need to wear your Apple Watch. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4450.7s)]
*  You don't even need to wear your whoop. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4452.7s)]
*  You don't even need to wear your oral ring. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4454.7s)]
*  The bed is gonna do it for you. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4456.7s)]
*  Just add it easily onto any bed. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4459.7s)]
*  And right now you head to 8 Sleep. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4462.7s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4482.7s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4483.7s)]
*  What is the problem with most of the pre-prepared meal services? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4484.7s)]
*  Okay, the food sucks. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4488.7s)]
*  Let's just call it what it is. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4489.7s)]
*  Most of the food is just not that great, and you're like, all right, I might as well order delivery. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4490.7s)]
*  Also, it doesn't feel fresh. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4494.7s)]
*  Most of them, you're like, yeah, this doesn't is, why does this not taste that good? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4496.7s)]
*  What exactly is going on? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4500.7s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, Cook Unity has solved these problems. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4502.7s)]

*  If you're not invited, you're going to be a little hurt. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4640.7s)]
*  It's going to bother me a little bit. I want you to want me there, but I also want you to know me well enough to know that I don't want to be there. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4643.7s)]

*  What do you mean? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4655.7s)]
*  Because he knows like he'll tell me, oh, bro, we went to the such-and-such-and-such. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4656.7s)]
*  You know, we did this other thing because I know you didn't want to go. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4661.7s)]
*  He said you got the best excuses to get out of like being in the sauna or working out. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4664.7s)]
*  What you mean? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4668.7s)]
*  When you guys do the workouts with Rogan. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4669.7s)]
*  That's propaganda. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4671.7s)]
*  He said you got the best excuses. He'd be like, I left my alarm on my phone. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4673.7s)]
*  No. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4678.7s)]
*  I got to get out this hot ass sauna because my alarm could go off. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4680.7s)]
*  This is what these niggas don't understand. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4683.7s)]
*  What is? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4686.7s)]
*  Like you said, I'm efficient and they not. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4688.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4693.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? And that's all it is. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4694.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think Rogan's efficient. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4696.7s)]
*  If we all say, hey, let's work out at 10. I'm there at 9.45, ready to start working out at 10. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4697.7s)]
*  And then we don't start working out till 10.30 because he's been there late. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4704.7s)]
*  And it's like, I got other shit to do. I planned on being here for two hours. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4708.7s)]
*  But now I've been here for three hours. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4712.7s)]
*  Because y'all are late. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4715.7s)]
*  Because y'all are late. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4716.7s)]
*  And that's social injustice. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4717.7s)]
*  And now you're giving me shit about leaving. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4718.7s)]
*  You're not concerned with my time. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4720.7s)]
*  Well, whatever it is. I mean, you can be concerned with whatever you want. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4722.7s)]
*  But it's like, I got to go. I got to go. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4725.7s)]
*  And also, I didn't want to do this. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4728.7s)]
*  It's like I'm here as like I like the camaraderie. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4732.7s)]
*  But I like working out by myself. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4735.7s)]
*  Yeah, you like doing everything by yourself. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4737.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4739.7s)]
*  Stand up. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4740.7s)]
*  Right. It is that. But stand up. But also stand up is the perfect thing. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4741.7s)]
*  Because it's a little bit. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4745.7s)]
*  You get the community. You get the camaraderie. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4746.7s)]
*  It's alone, but it's also. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4747.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4748.7s)]
*  And it's both of those things. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4749.7s)]
*  And it's on your terms. You get to talk about what you're talking about. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4750.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's why I look at every job I've ever excelled at. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4753.7s)]
*  It's been one where it's like, give me the night shift. Put me in the corner. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4756.7s)]
*  Put me where I know what I got to do every day and I ain't got to talk to no fucking body. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4760.7s)]
*  And what are the jobs with that? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4766.7s)]
*  I work. You know, I was a night shift at Intel. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4769.7s)]
*  And that's not really alone, but you kind of are working out. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4774.7s)]
*  And basically my job was just to move. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4777.7s)]
*  The computer company. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4779.7s)]
*  Yeah. It was just to move the wafers from the dry ash to the next step or whatever. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4780.7s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4786.7s)]
*  But you know how they make this computer chips? They fucking. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4788.7s)]
*  They take silicone and then they trace some chemical over top of it. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4791.7s)]
*  And then when they put that shit up to a certain temperature, it gets hard. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4797.7s)]
*  And then they scrape away the rest. And that's how you get the mini circuits. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4801.7s)]
*  Got it. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4805.7s)]
*  And so my step in the process was the plasma over that took it up to that temperature. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4806.7s)]
*  Got it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4811.7s)]
*  So, but I worked alone. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4812.7s)]
*  You know, I did the late shift. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4814.7s)]
*  It's crazy. Computer chips and fake tits are made of the same thing, ain't it? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4816.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4819.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4820.7s)]
*  That's a good ass point. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4821.7s)]
*  Actually, I think you can get fake tits made out of other shit now. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4822.7s)]
*  What? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4825.7s)]
*  I don't know. But I mean, you know, and you would think they would have like. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4826.7s)]
*  Saline, I think. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4829.7s)]
*  You would think some of them would come with like a little charger, you know, or something like that. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4830.7s)]
*  More stuff. If you're going to get stuff implanted in your titties. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4833.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4836.7s)]
*  Titty technology is not advanced the way you would think it would. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4837.7s)]
*  You should be able to like. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4839.7s)]
*  Get money in it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4840.7s)]
*  Like a little USB-C port. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4841.7s)]
*  Or just dictate the size. Like sometimes you want to have big titties for like an event. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4843.7s)]
*  And then sometimes you just want to have smaller titties. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4847.7s)]
*  Like a sleep number mattress. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4850.7s)]
*  To work out. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4851.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4852.7s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4853.7s)]
*  Yeah, you're really stuck with one thing. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4854.7s)]
*  Smaller tits. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4855.7s)]
*  That would be great. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4856.7s)]
*  Have the titties for the outfit you need. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4857.7s)]
*  Because you don't want to carry around big titties all fucking day. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4859.7s)]
*  But then sometimes you want to pop out and show people. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4861.7s)]
*  This is a billion dollar idea. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4864.7s)]
*  I think we really figured it out. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4866.7s)]
*  You got a family pool event. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4868.7s)]
*  You don't want some fat ass titties. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4869.7s)]
*  You're chilling. You're chilling. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4870.7s)]
*  And you get doctors to like start using that as a basic stat. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4871.7s)]
*  You know. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4874.7s)]
*  Like they take your blood pressure. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4875.7s)]
*  They ask you how much pain you're in. One to ten. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4877.7s)]
*  And they go, how much do you like your titties? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4879.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4880.7s)]
*  One to ten. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4881.7s)]
*  Boom. What's your tit number? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4882.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4883.7s)]
*  And so you pay the doctors to push it on people. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4884.7s)]
*  The last ten times you came, you weren't happy with your titties. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4886.7s)]
*  So have this flexibility. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4889.7s)]
*  I can prescribe you something for that. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4892.7s)]
*  So now the doctors are in it because they're getting money too. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4894.7s)]
*  See, this is one thing I love about Brian is that he knows all the future technology shit. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4897.7s)]
*  That's on the horizon. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4901.7s)]
*  Every gadget that's out. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4902.7s)]
*  Every type of gizmo. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4904.7s)]
*  Is that true? You're a tech dude like that? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4905.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm into it. A little bit. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4907.7s)]
*  Are you fucking with the AI shit at all or no? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4909.7s)]
*  That shit's bullshit. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4911.7s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4912.7s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4913.7s)]
*  I think what it is is something. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4914.7s)]
*  Chad GPT scared the shit out of all these companies. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4916.7s)]
*  And they all rushed to put this AI shit out. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4918.7s)]
*  And don't get me wrong, it's here to stay. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4921.7s)]
*  But none of it can do what it claims it can do. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4923.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4926.7s)]
*  Because Google just kind of tried to force their AI on all of their users. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4927.7s)]
*  And nobody gave a fuck. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4931.7s)]
*  And it can't even do shit to the old Google. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4932.7s)]
*  Apparently their CEO, I think I read that their CEO is getting fired off. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4933.7s)]
*  He need to get fired, this motherfucker. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4936.7s)]
*  Really? Yeah, they need to get fired. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4937.7s)]
*  Because my thing is, I let Google spy on me a long time ago. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4938.7s)]
*  They know everything about me. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4942.7s)]
*  I'm like, so use that information. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4943.7s)]
*  Be better. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4945.7s)]
*  Yeah, bitch. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4946.7s)]
*  Like when I'm asking you a question about me, you should know me well enough [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4947.7s)]
*  where you shouldn't be getting it wrong. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4951.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4953.7s)]
*  Yeah, they get that shit wrong all the time. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4954.7s)]
*  You got no excuse to be wrong. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4956.7s)]
*  You have all of my text messages. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4959.7s)]
*  You have all my Google searches. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4961.7s)]
*  All my emails. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4963.7s)]
*  Every bit of data. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4964.7s)]
*  Every YouTube video I've ever watched. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4965.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4967.7s)]
*  Yeah, so when I'm like, so when I go, I want a strawberry shortcake, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4968.7s)]
*  like you know that's what I want. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4972.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4973.7s)]
*  So why are you saying something else? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4974.7s)]
*  No, I do. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4975.7s)]
*  I do. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4976.7s)]
*  Like you got no excuse to fuck up. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4977.7s)]
*  Like your friends can fuck up. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4979.7s)]
*  Like I can fuck up a gift for my wife. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4981.7s)]
*  Maybe I don't know the exact thing she wants. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4983.7s)]
*  I don't have all the data. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4984.7s)]
*  But the algorithm should know exactly what she wants. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4986.7s)]
*  They should know you in and out. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4988.7s)]
*  And that's why TikTok works, because they take our decision making out of it. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4989.7s)]
*  They're just like, yo, just scroll. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4994.7s)]
*  We got you. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4997.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4998.7s)]
*  We'll figure it out. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=4999.7s)]
*  I promise we got you. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5000.7s)]
*  And it's on point. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5001.7s)]
*  Whereas Instagram's like, don't you want to see what your friends are doing? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5002.7s)]
*  No, I would have asked them if I wanted to see what the fuck they were doing. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5005.7s)]
*  Unless it's fire. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5007.7s)]
*  And then if it's fire. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5008.7s)]
*  Then it should pop up. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5009.7s)]
*  If it went viral, show me. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5010.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5011.7s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we don't have high enough expectations for AI. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5012.7s)]
*  We really should. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5015.7s)]
*  It's trash right now. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5016.7s)]
*  Try to get it to do anything. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5017.7s)]
*  All that stuff they're telling you. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5019.7s)]
*  So basically, everyone is scrambling to invest in this thing that can't do what you want [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5021.7s)]
*  for the investment. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5028.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5029.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5030.7s)]
*  It will be. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5031.7s)]
*  But I think we're way farther away than they. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5032.7s)]
*  But they've already went all in. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5034.7s)]
*  OK, so what's the fire shit out now that we're not giving enough credit for? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5036.7s)]
*  Or given enough credit to? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5039.7s)]
*  The fire technology? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5040.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5041.7s)]
*  Like, what is available right now that we're all seduced by this AI idea that we're not [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5042.7s)]
*  going, hey, this is really great. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5049.7s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5051.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5052.7s)]
*  I mean, TV technology is. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5053.7s)]
*  Like screen quality, you're saying? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5056.7s)]
*  Yeah, the screen shit is the QD OLED shit. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5058.7s)]
*  What's that? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5062.7s)]
*  QD OLED is like a... [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5063.7s)]
*  It's basically a new technology, the latest version of the newest screen technology. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5064.7s)]
*  So it's an LED screen. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5071.7s)]
*  It's just more sophisticated. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5073.7s)]
*  But it's quantum dot. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5074.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5075.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5076.7s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5078.7s)]
*  It's just like local dimming zones, really small pixel density, so you can like, your [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5079.7s)]
*  blacks are super black. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5084.7s)]
*  I knew he was going to do that. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5085.7s)]
*  Nerds don't know how to, you know what I mean? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5086.7s)]
*  Wait, tell me, tell me, tell me. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5088.7s)]
*  No, because I thought, because... [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5089.7s)]
*  Nerds don't know how to dim it down. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5091.7s)]
*  Because what he just did was he Dr. Fauci'd you. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5093.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5096.7s)]
*  Where it's like, you're not talking to other nerds, so you've got to break it down. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5097.7s)]
*  You're right, you're right. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5102.7s)]
*  He spoke to you. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5103.7s)]
*  So the local dimming zones, he don't know what that shit means. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5104.7s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5107.7s)]
*  So look, basically... [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5108.7s)]
*  They got light skin and dark skin black people now on TV. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5110.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5113.7s)]
*  No, so basically, just to, I'm going to oversimplify, but basically the last shit, the LED technology, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5114.7s)]
*  it was basically a light behind colored LEDs. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5122.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5126.7s)]
*  With OLED, the colored LEDs... [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5127.7s)]
*  Have their own light. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5130.7s)]
*  They have their own light. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5131.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5132.7s)]
*  And so it gives you more perfect contrast and more... [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5133.7s)]
*  Well, it's perfect contrast and it's more accurate. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5137.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5141.7s)]
*  That's why when you look at LED TV, you're like, holy shit. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5142.7s)]
*  OLED TV, you're like, holy shit. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5145.7s)]
*  Well, the problem with OLED was that they weren't bright enough. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5147.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5151.7s)]
*  So you would have great quality, but it didn't have the... [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5152.7s)]
*  It was impossible to make it bright enough without it overheating. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5158.7s)]
*  Oh, so they had to make it dimmer so it wouldn't overheat, and now they're getting to the point [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5163.7s)]
*  where they can make it... [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5167.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5169.7s)]
*  So you can watch sports first. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5170.7s)]
*  The other stuff was probably good for movies where shit could be darker and dimmer, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5171.7s)]
*  but I need to watch football bright. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5174.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5176.7s)]
*  But basically, don't buy a TV without talking to me, if you're ever going to buy a TV. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5177.7s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5180.7s)]
*  You got a nice one? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5181.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5182.7s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5183.7s)]
*  Okay, what about that curve shit? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5184.7s)]
*  Is that just propaganda? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5185.7s)]
*  Is that just like, oh, people are going to buy some curved TV? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5186.7s)]
*  No, that's better. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5189.7s)]
*  I mean, that's good for gaming. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5190.7s)]
*  It's more immersive, especially the 1000R curves, which basically, the more it curves, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5191.7s)]
*  the more immersive it'll be, but Samsung has like a... [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5198.7s)]
*  Like, I have it. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5201.7s)]
*  I have that monitor. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5202.7s)]
*  And it works? [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5203.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5204.7s)]
*  It's immersive. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5205.7s)]
*  That's what it's for. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5206.7s)]
*  It's a monitor, though. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5207.7s)]
*  It's not a TV. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5208.7s)]
*  It's for gaming, he's saying. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5209.7s)]
*  Yeah, but their monitors are also smart TVs, so you can go to the streaming services and [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5210.7s)]
*  everything on the monitor. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5215.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5216.7s)]
*  Based on what I'm hearing, for a TV, for it to really make you feel immersive, it had [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5217.7s)]
*  to be massive. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5221.7s)]
*  And then the curve, you're going to feel like, oh, I'm in this. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5223.7s)]
*  No, it just depends on how far away you sit. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5225.7s)]
*  Because the whole point is that it's supposed to fill up your peripheral. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5228.7s)]
*  And then I imagine you'd have to make content for that. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5232.7s)]
*  You have to shoot in a way that it can rap, or otherwise it's going to get distorted at [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5236.7s)]
*  the edges. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5239.7s)]
*  Well, they don't. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5240.7s)]
*  They don't do that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5241.7s)]
*  No, but they got AI processing the image to make it. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5242.7s)]
*  In real time to curve it. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5247.7s)]
*  Yeah, because I put it like this. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5248.7s)]
*  I had a curved monitor for a few years, and I recently gave it away and got a flat one. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5249.7s)]
*  And for maybe two weeks, it looked like the middle of my flat screen was bulging. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5255.7s)]
*  Because your eyes had adjusted. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5261.7s)]
*  You ever watch porn on the curve? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5264.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5266.7s)]
*  How is that shit? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5267.7s)]
*  Immersive? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5268.7s)]
*  Immersive, yeah. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5269.7s)]
*  Now that's scary. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5270.7s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5271.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5272.7s)]
*  Who's this guy? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5273.7s)]
*  You see fucking pubes right there? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5274.7s)]
*  You throw porn in the TV, you keep it local. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5275.7s)]
*  No, but it just looks the same, honestly. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5277.7s)]
*  It doesn't look curved when you're looking at it. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5279.7s)]
*  It just feels like your whole field of vision is full up. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5281.7s)]
*  It's almost like wearing a VR headset. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5283.7s)]
*  I was just going to ask you about that. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5285.7s)]
*  Is that going to take off? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5287.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5289.7s)]
*  I think. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5290.7s)]
*  Why has it taken so long? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5291.7s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it got hot for a second and just dropped. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5293.7s)]
*  It's taken so long because Apple hasn't made it not cumbersome yet. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5295.7s)]
*  Did you try the Vision Pro? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5300.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, I tried all that shit. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5301.7s)]
*  I have an Oculus that I never used. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5303.7s)]
*  What's better, the Oculus or the Apple Vision Pro or whatever? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5306.7s)]
*  I would get an Oculus over there. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5309.7s)]
*  It's more stuff, it's more games, it's more. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5311.7s)]
*  I bought the shit and it was cool for like a day. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5313.7s)]
*  I did the rock climbing thing where you're with Alex Honnold on the side of it. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5316.7s)]
*  It was amazing, you're looking at all this stuff. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5321.7s)]
*  But that's the novelty that wears off soon. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5323.7s)]
*  It's not going to take off until you can do that in addition to other shit. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5326.7s)]
*  Like right now they call it, they say we multi-screen people. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5331.7s)]
*  Because some people will have TV on, a tablet right here and a phone right here. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5334.7s)]
*  But it's like to do the Apple Vision Pro or the Oculus, you've got to put everything to the side and clear out space. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5338.7s)]
*  And it's like that's all you're doing is setting that up. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5345.7s)]
*  So that's why you get it and it's cool for a day. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5348.7s)]
*  But it's like I'm not going to keep moving the fucking coffee table. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5350.7s)]
*  Every single fucking time. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5353.7s)]
*  So Simon's little game, when I got games on my phone, I can just turn on the PlayStation that's on the TV. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5354.7s)]
*  So maybe it needs to be your glasses. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5359.7s)]
*  Like maybe it needs to be Ray-Bans. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5361.7s)]
*  But you need to have all the cool. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5363.7s)]
*  So they have to find a way to distill all that technology into something that's this small that you're putting on. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5365.7s)]
*  Because putting that headset on, maybe for a flight. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5370.7s)]
*  Like have you done it on a flight, Al? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5373.7s)]
*  Yeah, I did the Oculus on a flight. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5375.7s)]
*  And worth it or not? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5376.7s)]
*  Not really. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5377.7s)]
*  It's like you look crazy too. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5378.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5380.7s)]
*  You can't see if people are fucking jacking you. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5381.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5383.7s)]
*  Getting in front of you on the plane and shit. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5384.7s)]
*  No, you can see. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5385.7s)]
*  You can have it so you can see through. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5386.7s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5388.7s)]
*  So you keep tabs of motherfuckers trying it. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5389.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5391.7s)]
*  And people will try you too when they see that on your face because they don't know you can see them. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5392.7s)]
*  You know, but you can push a button and you can automatically see what's outside. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5395.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I've seen it. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5399.7s)]
*  And what do they do? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5400.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5401.7s)]
*  I mean, what are you going to do? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5402.7s)]
*  Your face is covered. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5403.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5405.7s)]
*  And you definitely shouldn't be out in public with no damn headset on. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5406.7s)]
*  You look ridiculous. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5409.7s)]
*  You look crazy, bro. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5410.7s)]
*  It was like a fashion accessory. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5411.7s)]
*  I saw it. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5412.7s)]
*  Remember people said that about Bluetooth headsets? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5413.7s)]
*  Remember when people first were making just phone calls on them? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5415.7s)]
*  Yeah, the first AirPods even. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5418.7s)]
*  These fucking douchebags. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5419.7s)]
*  Yeah, now everyone has them. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5420.7s)]
*  But they had to change it to a design form that we didn't mind. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5421.7s)]
*  You still don't see anybody walking around with that stupid fucking Bluetooth with a big mic sticking out. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5424.7s)]
*  When you see that thing, the one that's like a little rectangle, it almost looks like a little pez container. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5427.7s)]
*  Plantronics used to sell them and shit like that. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5434.7s)]
*  Yeah, they looked stupid. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5436.7s)]
*  The flash drive. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5437.7s)]
*  Everyone was like, I'm not doing it. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5438.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think it's it. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5439.7s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5440.7s)]
*  You just have to make it functional for our lifestyle. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5441.7s)]
*  And that stupid ass headset is not functional for us at all. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5443.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5445.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5446.7s)]
*  The way it is now, it ain't happening. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5447.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5448.7s)]
*  Nah, people ain't willing to give up that much. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5449.7s)]
*  It doesn't do that much cooler shit than what you already got. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5451.7s)]
*  It's hard to compete with the phone, man. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5455.7s)]
*  You iPhone or Android? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5457.7s)]
*  Android. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5458.7s)]
*  He really is a tech dude. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5459.7s)]
*  Yeah, some of you listen again. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5462.7s)]
*  Some of you Apple people are in a fucking cult and you don't realize it. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5464.7s)]
*  I just don't want to make everyone's tech screen. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5468.7s)]
*  That's it. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5470.7s)]
*  I know, but that's the trick they played on. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5471.7s)]
*  I know. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5473.7s)]
*  I know they got it. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5474.7s)]
*  Son, if America used WhatsApp, Apple's stock would plummet. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5475.7s)]
*  And listen, and I'm gonna stop you right now. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5479.7s)]
*  You can't shame or embarrass me in the switching. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5480.7s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5484.7s)]
*  Keep your iPhone. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5486.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5487.7s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about ruining your group chat. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5488.7s)]
*  I don't even like being in group chats. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5491.7s)]
*  But that's maybe why you do it, because you get to be alone. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5493.7s)]
*  I get to be alone. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5495.7s)]
*  Don't throw me in a group chat for what? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5496.7s)]
*  I don't want to be in no group messaging. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5499.7s)]
*  Because you can't leave. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5503.7s)]
*  Nothing pisses me off more than I get a group chat and there's four people in there whose number I don't have. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5506.7s)]
*  Who is this people? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5512.7s)]
*  Now you just gave them my number. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5513.7s)]
*  Now they pass my defenses. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5516.7s)]
*  I'm gonna check Indians. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5517.7s)]
*  We'll just put you on family group chats in WhatsApp. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5518.7s)]
*  And let me see. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5521.7s)]

*  I mean, how do you nuke a group chat though? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5540.7s)]
*  Like what's the like just. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5543.7s)]

*  People don't want to talk about it in front of their parents. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5549.7s)]
*  They don't want to talk about it for the lady. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5550.7s)]
*  You've done that? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5552.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5553.7s)]

*  Maybe I am. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5572.7s)]
*  It's really hitting me. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5574.7s)]
*  You're just incredibly principled. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5575.7s)]
*  You have a very set. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5577.7s)]
*  Except I keep it. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5578.7s)]
*  I keep it more. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5579.7s)]
*  I'm only opening it up because I'm talking to y'all and I probably drank too much this [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5580.7s)]
*  early. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5583.7s)]
*  Larry David keeps it in too, but the character is everything he wants to say. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5584.7s)]
*  Do you drink coffee? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5588.7s)]
*  When it's necessary. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5589.7s)]

*  in the thing and all of a sudden the tip thing pops up. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5594.7s)]
*  Like, do you tip on that? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5597.7s)]

*  To me it was, it's gratuity. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5617.7s)]
*  You haven't even given me the fucking product yet. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5619.7s)]

*  Is that the, is that the, do you guys tip the teller at the bank? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5636.7s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5640.7s)]
*  I don't tip, and I'll over tip some people. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5642.7s)]

*  I think. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5650.7s)]

*  notice? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5674.7s)]
*  30 cents. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5675.7s)]
*  Like, you go to check your bank account, if it's $20 missing, would you notice? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5676.7s)]
*  No. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5682.7s)]
*  So then what you crying about? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5683.7s)]
*  It's an amount of money that's nothing that you're just tipping. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5685.7s)]
*  And this is the shit I think you would relate to. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5689.7s)]
*  What do I think you deserve for what you did? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5692.7s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5694.7s)]
*  It's not about my money. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5696.7s)]
*  It's about your. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5697.7s)]
*  Yeah, I understand what you're saying. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5698.7s)]
*  Some of these baristas, they're just giving you a little bit of attitude, then they flip [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5699.7s)]
*  that fucking thing. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5702.7s)]
*  You ever have somebody get nice to you right when it's time to tip? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5703.7s)]
*  You have a waiter be kind of shitty the whole time and then right when they drop off the [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5705.7s)]
*  check, all of a sudden they're real gracious about it. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5708.7s)]
*  Fuck you, I'm under tipping now. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5710.7s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5712.7s)]
*  Just tip a dollar, tip whatever. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5713.7s)]
*  I tip a dollar now because he made me. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5714.7s)]
*  At the coffee shop? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5716.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5717.7s)]
*  But I used to just be like, you haven't done anything. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5718.7s)]
*  I don't know what I owe you. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5720.7s)]
*  You're a fucking smug barista. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5721.7s)]
*  There's a certain amount of social lubrication too. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5723.7s)]
*  So even though it doesn't make sense, like, am I really just going to start a thing over [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5725.7s)]
*  this? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5729.7s)]
*  Especially you go there regularly? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5730.7s)]
*  But yeah, I don't feel I'm starting a thing at the coffee shop. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5731.7s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5733.7s)]
*  Now I'll do it. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5734.7s)]
*  They remember. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5735.7s)]
*  They remember. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5736.7s)]
*  If you go to the same place, they go home. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5737.7s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5739.7s)]
*  I'll sign and flip it around. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5740.7s)]
*  If I want to tip, I'm not going to pretend we didn't tip. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5742.7s)]
*  Here you go. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5745.7s)]
*  There you go. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5746.7s)]
*  It sounds like you're looking for reasons to not tip. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5747.7s)]
*  Oh, that's for sure. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5750.7s)]
*  What are we doing wrong in America? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5751.7s)]
*  We're being nice to everybody. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5755.7s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5757.7s)]
*  I think people should feel- [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5759.7s)]
*  Tipping baristas? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5760.7s)]
*  No, I just think people are scared to be rude now. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5761.7s)]
*  People are scared of being recorded being rude so nobody's being honest. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5765.7s)]
*  So they act like they're cool with shit that they're not. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5770.7s)]
*  For example? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5772.7s)]
*  You know, like the bitch just knocked down on a medallion, getting in the [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5776.7s)]
*  diamond medallion line. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5779.7s)]
*  So everybody's being polite because we don't want to be on camera representing [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5781.7s)]
*  a part of our personality that we could be shamed for. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5787.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5790.7s)]
*  So we're worried about social shame, and therefore we're operating in a [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5791.7s)]
*  fake way in the world. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5795.7s)]
*  Is everyone confrontable? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5796.7s)]
*  We need more people that don't give a fuck. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5798.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5800.7s)]
*  Because then they'll allow other people to also not give a fuck, and by not [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5801.7s)]
*  giving a fuck then we will be more authentic and honest with one another. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5804.7s)]
*  And check the entitled people who might be trying to get away with too much, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5808.7s)]
*  I think. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5810.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5811.7s)]
*  Sometimes the entitled people are scary, though. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5812.7s)]
*  In my neighborhood there's this giant dude, Dominican guy, jacked, steroids. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5814.7s)]
*  He's got a dog off the leash. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5818.7s)]
*  Hate it. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5820.7s)]
*  Pit bull. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5821.7s)]
*  That's a little crazy. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5822.7s)]
*  Off the leash, and the pit bull shits on the sidewalk, and then he keeps on [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5823.7s)]
*  walking. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5826.7s)]
*  And I've seen it happen like twice. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5827.7s)]
*  And what you do about it? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5829.7s)]
*  I fucking walked away. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5830.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5831.7s)]
*  What would you do? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5832.7s)]
*  It's a pit bull, off the leash, and a giant dude. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5833.7s)]
*  He's talking about the Dominican one. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5836.7s)]
*  So when you're saying he's a giant dude like you're scared of him. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5838.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5842.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5843.7s)]
*  I would say wow. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5844.7s)]
*  You can still act like, yo, can you curb your dog? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5846.7s)]
*  I could be scared of another grown man as well. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5849.7s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5851.7s)]
*  There's no guy you're scared of? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5852.7s)]
*  He bleeds just like you. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5854.7s)]
*  Yeah, but you have to make him bleed. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5855.7s)]
*  I'm just fucking with you. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5856.7s)]
*  You make a smart decision when you get a pistol. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5857.7s)]
*  What's happening? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5860.7s)]
*  You came to New York. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5861.7s)]
*  That's why we got pit bulls. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5863.7s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5865.7s)]
*  I mean, is it serious enough for you where you would hurt a motherfucker? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5866.7s)]
*  No. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5869.7s)]
*  I'm not going to go fight a guy over dog shit, literally. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5870.7s)]
*  Okay, so then what you crying about? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5872.7s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5874.7s)]
*  But I'm saying, is this someone that you would be like, hey, man, you got to pick up the [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5875.7s)]
*  dog shit? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5878.7s)]
*  And he goes, oh, what are you going to do about it? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5879.7s)]
*  And then what? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5880.7s)]
*  Oh, then, then, oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5881.7s)]
*  So if I try to beat Cordray, I'm just like, hey, man, you mind picking up your dog shit? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5883.7s)]
*  Yeah, and he goes, fuck you. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5887.7s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5889.7s)]
*  I wouldn't say another word to him, but I would slowly start planning revenge, though. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5890.7s)]
*  So you give people a chance to do the right thing. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5894.7s)]
*  Well, what I'm not going to do is be uncomfortable where I live at. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5898.7s)]
*  I'm not asking you to do something unreasonable. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5901.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5905.7s)]
*  What does revenge look like? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5906.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5907.7s)]
*  Maybe, you know, maybe hiding some fucking laxative and some bacon along the trail so [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5909.7s)]
*  the dog gets home. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5913.7s)]
*  You were thinking the same thing. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5915.7s)]
*  I was thinking the exact same thing. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5917.7s)]
*  I'm like, oh, hide some laxative. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5918.7s)]
*  I almost thanked this dude the other day. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5920.7s)]
*  There's this dude who was almost homeless with a pit bull the other day. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5922.7s)]
*  Almost homeless? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5925.7s)]
*  Yeah, they got those in New York. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5926.7s)]
*  White guys that are like... [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5928.7s)]
*  He was a black dude, but it was close. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5929.7s)]
*  He had the pit bull. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5932.7s)]
*  He's almost homeless. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5933.7s)]
*  We're at this park, okay? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5934.7s)]
*  And it's a kids singing class. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5937.7s)]
*  My daughter, you know, they're just like five months old. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5939.7s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck they're doing, but it's something for them to do, whatever. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5941.7s)]
*  And they do it outside. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5944.7s)]
*  No, watch. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5945.7s)]
*  They do it outside so they don't got to pay rent. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5946.7s)]
*  Okay? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5948.7s)]
*  So we're outside singing and this dude had a pit bull. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5949.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5953.7s)]
*  What do you want? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5954.7s)]
*  You want tequila? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5955.7s)]
*  We'll get some more tequila in there. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5956.7s)]
*  No, that one's not good. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5957.7s)]
*  That's just for show. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5958.7s)]
*  Oh, that's not good? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5959.7s)]
*  Actually, it is good. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5960.7s)]
*  This one? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5961.7s)]
*  That's harsh. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5962.7s)]
*  Oh, it might be strong. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5963.7s)]
*  We'll get some more tequila in here. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5964.7s)]
*  Miles, ask them to bring some more tequila. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5965.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5966.7s)]
*  And some ice too, Miles. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5967.7s)]
*  So this dude had his pit bull. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5968.7s)]
*  He was on a leash and there's just a bunch of infants around. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5972.7s)]
*  And the pit bull turned around and like barked a couple times. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5975.7s)]
*  Okay? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5979.7s)]
*  And all these parents are so polite. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5980.7s)]
*  They're not going to ask the guy who's got his fucking shoes off with the pit bull to [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5981.7s)]
*  not do anything. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5984.7s)]
*  And he saw the dog bark and the guy got his fucking feet out like I don't know what's [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5986.7s)]
*  going on. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5990.7s)]
*  And he saw the dog bark and he called the dog over and he put a muzzle on the dog and [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5992.7s)]
*  they just kept back enjoying his day. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5997.7s)]
*  And I almost went to him after and was like, you know, thank you for doing that thing that [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=5999.7s)]
*  made everybody else feel comfortable without us having to have this awkward social interaction [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6005.7s)]
*  where I ask you to make the kids feel comfortable because you've got the dog that eats the kids. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6011.7s)]
*  I wish I actually thanked him because I think that behavior needs to be rewarded. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6015.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6019.7s)]
*  Like he did the right thing for no reward. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6020.7s)]
*  It was considerate. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6022.7s)]
*  But it was considerate. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6023.7s)]
*  Considerate. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6024.7s)]
*  And in New York so often times people are not, everybody's in their own world because [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6025.7s)]
*  there's like millions of people here and you just ignore everybody around you. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6028.7s)]
*  That's why I did finally try the cat's deli that everyone keeps talking about. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6031.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6035.7s)]
*  But I will never go in there again. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6036.7s)]
*  I almost exploded in that place. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6037.7s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6039.7s)]
*  Because it's an hour wait in line. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6040.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6042.7s)]
*  And what happens is, I'm not going to say the race of people, but what happens is sometimes [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6043.7s)]
*  people, they will, because you ever walk in there, there's like 10 different cutters [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6047.7s)]
*  for you to walk up to. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6052.7s)]
*  So they give you a ticket and you're not supposed to have more than two people on one ticket. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6053.7s)]
*  But this family of like 10 decided to put two people in there to order for the whole family. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6057.7s)]
*  So now it's 10 tickets. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6064.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6065.7s)]
*  So now it's right. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6066.7s)]
*  So now the line I'm in, I'm, you know, everyone behind this lady is waiting like an hour for [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6067.7s)]
*  this guy to make 10. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6073.7s)]
*  You know, and I'm sitting there the whole time like, and I just, it's just everything [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6076.7s)]
*  in me. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6079.7s)]
*  You know, and then they put little samples up there, you know, and I wanted to be like, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6081.7s)]
*  really bitch, you don't know what brisket tastes like? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6086.7s)]
*  You're here for the brisket. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6090.7s)]
*  Yeah, you've been in line for an hour and a half. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6091.7s)]
*  It's not like it's some exotic Cambodian dish, right? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6095.7s)]
*  It's a fucking hot dog. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6098.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6099.7s)]
*  I just, you know, I can't do anywhere where I have to, where people have to like be thoughtful. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6100.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6107.7s)]
*  I just see. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6108.7s)]
*  But the thing is New York, we kind of call it how it is. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6109.7s)]
*  So I think other people online would have respected the fact if you called that family [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6112.7s)]
*  up. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6116.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's not as polite as California. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6117.7s)]
*  But I'm like, but listen, I'm like, I'm in the middle of an iconic Jewish deli. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6119.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6123.7s)]
*  I didn't think I was going to have to New York for the New Yorkers. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6124.7s)]
*  I was like, where's New Yorkers? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6126.7s)]
*  New Yorkers don't go there. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6128.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6129.7s)]
*  A New Yorker would never wait an hour for a sandwich. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6130.7s)]
*  But I don't think you can fake it either though. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6132.7s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6134.7s)]
*  Like you can't, people ain't going, you can't fake the attitude. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6135.7s)]
*  But that's just who you naturally are. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6138.7s)]
*  Hey, I'm New York and over here, everybody. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6140.7s)]
*  It would be weird because you're with tourists. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6142.7s)]
*  But if it happened at like a real New York establishment, if that was going on, it'd [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6145.7s)]
*  be like, yo, this is crazy. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6148.7s)]
*  So what's the real, what's up? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6150.7s)]
*  Katz is not a real spot? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6151.7s)]
*  It was. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6152.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6153.7s)]
*  And I think now it's mostly tourists. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6154.7s)]
*  And the food is fire. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6156.7s)]
*  It's a little tourist spot now. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6157.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6158.7s)]
*  All right. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6159.7s)]
*  Let's say you're on the train. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6160.7s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6161.7s)]
*  And it's a little packed, all right? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6162.7s)]
*  And you're trying to sit down. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6163.7s)]
*  It's been a long day. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6164.7s)]
*  You're exhausted. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6165.7s)]
*  And there's a guy sitting there. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6166.7s)]
*  He's playing music. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6168.7s)]
*  He's got his feet up on the seat and you want to go sit down. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6169.7s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6172.7s)]
*  Can you move your feet, please? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6173.7s)]
*  And all of a sudden he's like, nah, nah. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6174.7s)]
*  Go sit over there. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6177.7s)]
*  Am I bigger than him? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6178.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6179.7s)]
*  Don't move your fucking feet. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6180.7s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6181.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'll escalate real quick. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6182.7s)]
*  You'll take me to the top. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6183.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6185.7s)]
*  And if you're not bigger than him, then what? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6186.7s)]
*  You guys gotta eat that. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6191.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6193.7s)]
*  Like I said- [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6194.7s)]
*  But you'd be down to fight. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6195.7s)]
*  Don't put yourself in a situation where you're gonna lose anything. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6196.7s)]
*  You would be down to fight, though. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6200.7s)]
*  I would be down to threaten. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6203.7s)]
*  Obviously I don't want to fight, but if I'm bigger than you, I'm going to take the chance [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6205.7s)]
*  that you're a little bitch, especially since you need so much fucking room. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6209.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6213.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bitch behavior. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6215.46s)]
*  Has that ever gone sideways for you? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6217.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6218.94s)]
*  Do you get in a lot of fights? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6220.0199999999995s)]
*  No, not anymore. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6221.0599999999995s)]
*  But you used to? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6222.139999999999s)]
*  But I mean, I'm pretty good at avoiding. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6223.78s)]
*  Bigger guys. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6226.86s)]
*  No, no, no, but most of the time you can reason with people. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6229.62s)]
*  If you're dealing with somebody unreasonable, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6233.3s)]
*  you should probably just get out of that situation. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6234.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6236.179999999999s)]
*  Most, cause I learned from working at the door [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6237.66s)]
*  and so many places, most men just wanna save face. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6240.099999999999s)]
*  So as long as you ain't trying to make a man [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6243.9800000000005s)]
*  look like a bitch in front of his woman. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6246.14s)]
*  Then it gets a little crazy. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6247.66s)]
*  Or his homies, yeah, but if you pull somebody to the side, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6248.5s)]
*  you're like, hey man, I know what's going on with the woman. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6250.86s)]
*  Like you can reason with most men. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6253.38s)]
*  Women, you know, it's really 50-50 [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6255.38s)]
*  whether they're gonna be logical or not. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6257.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6259.22s)]
*  So it ain't about- [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6260.06s)]
*  50-50, I thought it was zero one huntsman. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6260.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6262.34s)]
*  Cause 90% of the time my shows [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6263.94s)]
*  are interrupted by drunk white girls. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6266.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6268.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6268.86s)]
*  If I see a white bitch with a tiara, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6269.94s)]
*  I know she's gonna ruin the whole show. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6271.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6272.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna definitely have to speak to her. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6273.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6275.139999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6275.98s)]
*  Anything that make a white lady feel special, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6276.82s)]
*  you see a sash, you see a crown. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6279.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6282.82s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6283.66s)]
*  Why do you think they need that? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6284.48s)]
*  Why do they need to feel special? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6287.9s)]
*  Like, oh, it's my birthday week or whatever. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6289.98s)]
*  I have no idea, man. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6292.179999999999s)]
*  Cause I think if you ask them, they gonna be like, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6294.78s)]
*  you know, the patriarchy or something like that. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6296.62s)]
*  And I'd like to try to take them at their word, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6300.179999999999s)]
*  but that shit don't make sense. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6301.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6302.98s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6304.0199999999995s)]
*  I think some people just wanna, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6305.7s)]
*  if they feel powerless in their real life, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6307.219999999999s)]
*  they wanna feel powerless. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6308.86s)]
*  Powerful. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6310.5s)]
*  They wanna feel powerful. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6311.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6312.179999999999s)]
*  So maybe that's it. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6313.0199999999995s)]
*  But I don't know, but almost every show [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6314.98s)]
*  you gotta tell somebody, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6316.42s)]
*  I don't care that it's your birthday, you know. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6317.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6319.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're not special. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6320.0199999999995s)]
*  What is your day when you're like at a club, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6321.34s)]

*  Wake up, gym, Best Buy. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6327.86s)]
*  Wait, why Best Buy? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6331.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6332.94s)]
*  Best Buy is so soothing to me. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6333.78s)]
*  I like to walk through a Best Buy. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6334.86s)]
*  He just like to be amongst the gadgets. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6336.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6339.299999999999s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6340.139999999999s)]
*  So you find a Best Buy after the gym [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6343.139999999999s)]
*  and you just go peruse the Best Buy. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6347.38s)]
*  Yeah, I usually peruse the Best Buy, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6348.94s)]
*  get my mind off things. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6350.94s)]
*  Maybe make a little perk. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6352.78s)]
*  Cause you gotta understand, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6354.259999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I'm a perv, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6355.099999999999s)]
*  but I'm a perv. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6355.94s)]
*  Cause you gotta understand, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6357.179999999999s)]
*  when I walk through there, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6359.58s)]
*  it's like all this stuff I used to walk through Best Buy [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6361.0199999999995s)]
*  and I couldn't afford. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6362.86s)]
*  Now you got it. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6363.7s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6371.66s)]
*  So it's just my little place. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6372.58s)]
*  Yeah, go to Best Buy, go get some food. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6375.94s)]
*  I go to a nice little steak or something. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6378.219999999999s)]
*  And then straight to the show. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6381.0199999999995s)]
*  And then shows. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6382.099999999999s)]
*  Are there days where you won't talk to anybody [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6383.0599999999995s)]
*  before you go on stage? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6384.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6385.94s)]
*  You mean a perfect day? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6386.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6388.0199999999995s)]
*  I have those every now and then. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6388.86s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6394.0199999999995s)]
*  When you don't see nobody all day, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6395.54s)]
*  that's the best, man. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6398.82s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6399.94s)]
*  My experience on the road is like completely different. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6400.78s)]
*  Cause I would have those days [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6404.259999999999s)]
*  where I didn't talk to anybody before I went on. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6406.0599999999995s)]
*  And I always felt weird. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6407.98s)]
*  Like I want to like warm up the social interaction [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6410.139999999999s)]
*  before I have the highest stakes version of it [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6413.86s)]
*  where I'm on stage. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6416.94s)]
*  No, there's very few people that I can be in a room with [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6418.299999999999s)]
*  and I feel like I'm, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6422.62s)]
*  and I still feel as relaxed as if I'm alone. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6423.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6425.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6426.42s)]
*  But certain people can, Derek. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6427.259999999999s)]
*  You and Derek can do this. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6428.66s)]
*  Like if it's before a show, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6430.179999999999s)]
*  like before I shot my specials, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6431.78s)]
*  like everybody needs to get out except him. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6432.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6434.54s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6435.38s)]
*  comics, usually comics. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6436.219999999999s)]
*  If it's a comic that I respect, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6437.38s)]
*  then them being there doesn't make me feel like [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6439.259999999999s)]
*  there's someone here that I need to meet. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6441.38s)]
*  So Derek will give you your space [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6443.9400000000005s)]
*  to just kind of do your thing. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6445.900000000001s)]
*  He don't need my attention. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6447.46s)]
*  He don't need attention. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6448.58s)]
*  He don't need to be making, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6449.66s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6450.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6451.820000000001s)]
*  But yeah, but alone, that's perfect. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6452.66s)]
*  That's the bee's knees. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6456.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6458.54s)]
*  And that's why like when people go on the road with me, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6459.38s)]
*  like I'm like, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6460.860000000001s)]
*  that's the first thing I always say to them like, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6461.7s)]
*  you ain't gotta do none of this shit I'm doing. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6463.3s)]
*  In fact, I prefer you don't. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6464.820000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6466.42s)]
*  You know? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6467.3s)]
*  Do you enjoy the attention you get on stage? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6468.14s)]
*  Cause for me, I remember wanting attention when I was younger. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6469.9800000000005s)]
*  Now that I get it on stage, I don't care for it, but like. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6472.62s)]
*  Well, you know what I realized for me [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6475.18s)]
*  is not about attention, it's about control. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6476.5s)]
*  It's the fact that like I'm in charge, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6479.74s)]
*  there's no variables. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6481.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6482.78s)]
*  Well the tiara happens and that drives you crazy [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6483.62s)]
*  cause now you're not in control. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6485.14s)]
*  Cause now I gotta fucking vibe. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6486.58s)]
*  And the thing is those people, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6488.98s)]
*  they don't realize that they're doing that shit [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6490.5s)]
*  at your expense because. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6493.26s)]
*  And the other people there too. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6494.98s)]
*  Yeah, when you interrupt, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6496.22s)]
*  then I have to still make it funny. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6498.38s)]
*  And if I don't make it funny, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6502.5s)]
*  it's still me that didn't make it funny. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6503.7s)]
*  And so you're doing it at no risk to yourself. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6505.42s)]
*  You think that everybody's trying to aggrieve you, huh? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6510.78s)]
*  No, but I'm just. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6514.66s)]
*  But I'm not gonna give you the opportunity. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6518.7s)]
*  Have you been sued before? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6521.139999999999s)]
*  No, I've not been sued, no. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6522.78s)]

*  He gets got all the time. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6529.099999999999s)]
*  Enough times to get got and you gonna [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6530.46s)]
*  have your head on a swivel. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6531.9400000000005s)]
*  Like how have you gotten got? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6533.9400000000005s)]
*  But you have to be careful not to appear paranoid. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6534.78s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6537.58s)]
*  I think that ship has sailed for you. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6539.46s)]
*  For me? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6541.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6541.9400000000005s)]
*  No, what I do is I just go to extraordinary lengths [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6542.78s)]
*  to avoid things that irritate me. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6545.1s)]

*  Yeah, I just don't be there. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6554.3s)]
*  Wait, when have you gotten got? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6557.26s)]
*  That's why, listen, if you ask any, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6558.58s)]
*  if my reputation in the comedy world is that I'm chill, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6560.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm always chilling. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6564.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6565.46s)]
*  Right, but I'm always also irritated. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6566.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6569.14s)]
*  But you ain't never heard no stories of me flipping out [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6569.9800000000005s)]
*  cause I leave. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6571.820000000001s)]
*  Cause the way you handle your irritation is you exit. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6572.66s)]
*  I'm living at about a three. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6575.780000000001s)]
*  Once I'm over five, I'm leaving. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6577.02s)]
*  Done. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6578.700000000001s)]
*  I'm leaving and some shit send me straight to 10. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6579.58s)]
*  So I avoid all those situations. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6582.46s)]
*  That's why I check a bag. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6584.780000000001s)]
*  Man, we had this whole argument about checking bags. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6585.62s)]
*  What happened? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6587.34s)]
*  Cause you were like, why do you check a bag? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6588.34s)]
*  I would never check a bag if I don't have to [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6590.78s)]
*  at the airport. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6591.7s)]
*  Right, well, everyone's giving me shit about it. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6592.54s)]
*  But the truth is, not checking a bag only makes sense [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6594.7s)]
*  if waiting for your bag irritates you. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6599.259999999999s)]
*  Is the number one concern. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6602.299999999999s)]
*  I have another one, but go on. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6604.9s)]
*  See, for me, my maximum irritation come from me [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6606.139999999999s)]
*  waiting for people. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6609.099999999999s)]
*  So, cause I like to get on the plane last. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6610.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6613.299999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6614.139999999999s)]
*  I don't want to get on early cause I don't want to be [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6614.98s)]
*  sitting there all the time. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6615.82s)]
*  But what happens is sometimes- [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6616.66s)]
*  There's no more room. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6617.5s)]
*  People will take, they will take the above space. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6618.34s)]
*  So you gotta put your shit back deeper. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6621.06s)]
*  And then you gotta wait for all these fucks [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6623.66s)]
*  to get off the plane before you get off the plane. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6625.06s)]
*  And that is the moment where I might fucking pop my- [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6626.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6630.82s)]
*  And so to avoid that moment, I don't put nothing above. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6631.66s)]
*  Everything get checked. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6634.74s)]
*  And it keeps it from stealing from you. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6636.06s)]
*  Son, I had a girl grab my fucking suitcase [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6638.3s)]
*  out of the overhead, go to, leave the airport. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6640.7s)]
*  Left her suitcase, thought mine was hers. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6643.46s)]
*  Different color, different shape, different weight. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6646.78s)]
*  All my shit was still in the suitcase when I went home. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6648.62s)]
*  But she does this dumb bitch just reached up, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6650.66s)]
*  grabbed the wrong suitcase and left the airport. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6653.0599999999995s)]
*  This drove our cars crazy. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6654.62s)]
*  And it is an infuriating thing to happen. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6655.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6657.82s)]
*  How did you track her down? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6658.66s)]
*  Big cab, my leg, the guy was shooting at us, all my stuff. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6661.0599999999995s)]
*  He was like, yo, she might have a tag. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6663.74s)]
*  I didn't even think about that. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6665.3s)]
*  I'm so fucking irritated. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6666.12s)]
*  Open the tag up, there's a phone number. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6667.139999999999s)]
*  We call her like four times, finally she calls back. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6668.82s)]
*  And then what annoyed me is, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6671.139999999999s)]
*  she seemed pretty apologetic on the phone. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6673.38s)]
*  But then when she came, she was a little embarrassed [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6675.22s)]
*  and she was like, sorry, and then left. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6676.9800000000005s)]
*  But I need like a profuse apology. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6678.34s)]
*  That was like an hour of my life [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6680.900000000001s)]
*  that you just had my fucking suitcase in a car. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6682.34s)]
*  And also your suitcases don't look the same. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6683.62s)]
*  Yes, different size, different color, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6685.38s)]
*  and her shit was heavy. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6687.780000000001s)]
*  I think she didn't want to carry her goddamn suitcase [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6689.3s)]
*  if I'm being honest. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6691.1s)]
*  Mine was light, it was a two day trip. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6692.18s)]
*  Wow, that would drive me crazy. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6693.9800000000005s)]
*  I would have to have an explanation. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6695.9800000000005s)]
*  I was annoyed. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6696.9800000000005s)]
*  But let me guess, you was nice to her, weren't you? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6697.820000000001s)]
*  I wanted to, so I felt bad that she was older. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6699.9800000000005s)]
*  But I was gonna be like, I'm gonna ask her, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6702.26s)]
*  what were you thinking? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6704.82s)]
*  I just need to know, not even angry. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6705.66s)]
*  I just need to know how you made this mistake. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6707.18s)]
*  And then she was older, so I was like, ugh. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6709.0599999999995s)]
*  Nah, you gotta, she had the very least deserved [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6711.099999999999s)]
*  over the shoulder dumb ass bitch. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6714.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6717.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6717.98s)]
*  You know, stupid ass. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6718.82s)]
*  Pour some water in the suitcase? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6719.66s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6720.5s)]
*  What are you thinking is what I wanted. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6721.34s)]
*  I just need to know what, did it never occur to you [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6723.139999999999s)]
*  that the suitcase was a different color, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6725.3s)]
*  it rolled differently, it's a different brand? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6726.66s)]
*  Like, did none of this occur to you? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6728.98s)]
*  She was drunk, she must have been drunk. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6729.82s)]
*  She wasn't thinking. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6731.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6732.34s)]
*  So I had, so you know, if your flight get delayed [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6733.18s)]
*  due to weather, they don't owe you nothing. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6737.14s)]
*  They don't owe you a hotel. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6739.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, that drives me crazy. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6740.62s)]
*  Maybe making up the weather too. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6741.46s)]
*  And so I had to lay over in Seattle, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6742.3s)]
*  and I was pretty much gonna be in the airport [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6744.62s)]
*  for like 10 hours, right? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6746.22s)]
*  And I kept going out, coming back in to smoke, blah, blah, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6748.06s)]
*  blah, blah. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6750.42s)]
*  Then the morning shift people get there, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6751.26s)]
*  and now it's a problem with my shea butter. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6754.22s)]
*  Now you know enough black people, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6758.58s)]
*  the shea butter, it's like rock solid. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6760.0199999999995s)]
*  Like you need a fucking blowtorch to get it. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6763.78s)]
*  Like if you get, and so this dude, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6765.78s)]
*  this black TSA agent is like, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6768.98s)]
*  yeah, you can't take this through. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6770.78s)]
*  And I'm like, bro, I've taken this through here [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6771.9s)]
*  like 15 times in a row. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6773.58s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I don't know what to tell you. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6776.419999999999s)]
*  He's like, you can't take butter on a plane. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6777.82s)]
*  I was like, it's not butter, it's shea butter. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6779.139999999999s)]
*  And he calls over the supervisor, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6781.9s)]
*  he calls over this white dude, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6783.299999999999s)]
*  and before the dude even gets there, [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6784.86s)]
*  he goes, can he have butter on a plane? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6786.179999999999s)]
*  Knowing that the white dude doesn't know. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6788.78s)]
*  What, shea butter? [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6791.099999999999s)]
*  Right, he's like, of course not, and walks off. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6791.94s)]
*  So he takes my fucking shea butter. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6794.46s)]
*  And he was like, he wanted my shea butter [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6796.86s)]
*  because it was high quality shit. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6798.82s)]
*  And so now I'm in Billings, Montana, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6800.219999999999s)]
*  one of the driest places in America [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6802.62s)]
*  with no fucking moisturization, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6804.219999999999s)]
*  and there's no black sections in the CBS. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6805.54s)]
*  There's no urban curls, none of that shit. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6807.46s)]
*  And so that moment burned in my eyes, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6810.38s)]
*  I said, never again, never again. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLGAs5Ymkk&t=6812.98s)]
