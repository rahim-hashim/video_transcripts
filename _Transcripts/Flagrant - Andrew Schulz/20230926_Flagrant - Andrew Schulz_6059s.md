# Dave Portnoy on Taylor Swift Travis Kelce Romance, Meeting Obama’s Gay Lover & Deion Sanders Secret
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM)
*  Travis Kelce, you don't get the appeal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, he's got studs. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1.72s)]
*  Sort of doofus. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2.92s)]
*  I don't like Travis Kelce's style at all. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4.0s)]
*  I think he's a little bit cringy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=7.24s)]
*  The man had his own dating show. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=8.8s)]
*  If you have a dating show, that's a little cringy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=10.68s)]
*  Why is there a dating show? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=13.24s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=15.48s)]
*  He's a little cornball to me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=16.28s)]
*  Like his quote, like, Taylor, I saw you rock MetLife. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=17.44s)]
*  Why don't you come see me rock Arrowhead? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=20.12s)]
*  Like, lame. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=22.16s)]
*  Who's your ideal match for Taylor? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=23.36s)]
*  All right, let me give you a thought. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=24.92s)]
*  Who would be, like, a good match for Taylor? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=26.04s)]
*  Could Dave handle that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=27.92s)]
*  Look, I have no interest sexually in Taylor Swift. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=28.96s)]
*  I call her mother. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  It's like, what mother wants, mother gets. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=32.4s)]
*  Like, fine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=34.0s)]
*  They call her mother. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=34.96s)]
*  Like, get educated. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=35.88s)]
*  I was unaware. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=37.88s)]
*  Gyllenhaal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  They've done that, though. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=41.88s)]
*  Yo, you're not a Swiftie. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  No, I know they've done it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=43.88s)]
*  No, don't do this where you pretend you didn't know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=44.88s)]
*  I know them all. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Trust me, I know. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=47.84s)]
*  Yo, don't. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  You're not. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=50.0s)]
*  Gyllenhaal, that was a rock. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Give me those friendship bracelets, bro. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=51.52s)]
*  You're a dessert. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=53.08s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=54.0s)]
*  Welcome to Flagrant. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=54.6s)]
*  Today, joining us once again, we have the man [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=55.28s)]
*  and the myth, the legend, Dave Portnoy, in the building. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=58.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=60.68s)]
*  Move, move, move. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=61.68s)]
*  The new owner of Barstool Sports. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=64.48s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=65.04s)]
*  I imagine you are the sole proprietor of the PizzaFest [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=70.12s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=71.08s)]
*  Is this a partnership? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=71.8s)]
*  Yeah, we partner with Medium Rare. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=72.6s)]
*  So they're like, they're the best. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=74.56s)]
*  I could never pull off what we did at the PizzaFest by myself. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=75.84s)]
*  I had no interest in doing it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Because to get those pizza places that we had, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=81.08s)]
*  which are the best, like, you need their ovens, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=83.04s)]
*  the coordination. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  I want to get into that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  No chance I could have done that without them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  OK, I want to get into that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  But first, I need to, and we also [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=89.8s)]
*  got to talk about this hit piece. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=92.92s)]
*  But first, I need to share with the audience, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=93.4s)]
*  you sent me the richest text message [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=96.04s)]
*  I've ever gotten in my entire life. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=97.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=99.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=100.44s)]
*  I'm excited about this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=100.92s)]
*  This is exciting. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=103.92s)]
*  I know, Coach, have you heard this text? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=104.72s)]
*  No. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=106.04s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=106.54s)]
*  It was funny when he replied. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=107.04s)]
*  This is the richest text. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  I have to give it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=108.92s)]
*  OK, so it's Labor Day weekend. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=109.44s)]
*  I'm out at the Hamptons. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, Dave's got a place out here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=111.92s)]
*  And I think Mom Talk. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=113.48s)]
*  Yeah, Mom Talk. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=114.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=114.84s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, maybe he's out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  We're going to go to Surf Lodge and watch Blondish, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  So I hit up, there we go. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=118.72s)]
*  Yo, you in the Hamptons this week? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  He goes, yep. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  I go, hey, there's a fantastic DJ at Surf Lodge on Saturday. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=122.28s)]
*  Blondish will be there if you want to join. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=125.84s)]
*  He goes, you got a table? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=128.32s)]
*  That's the first thing to crack me up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=130.76s)]
*  I'm not going to fucking stand. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=132.4s)]
*  I know you can't walk around regular. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=133.68s)]
*  You can't walk around regular. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=135.36s)]
*  But it was a funny thing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  I go, yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=137.0s)]
*  He goes, OK, I haven't gone in a minute. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=137.8s)]
*  I go, I'll hit you when you're rolling over. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  He goes, perf. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=141.72s)]
*  I go, OK, next day, I go, we just got to Surf Lodge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=142.52s)]
*  Pull up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=145.56s)]
*  And this is the text. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=146.44s)]
*  He goes, I got to watch a horse I own in a race soon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=147.56s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=152.52s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=154.52s)]
*  It was a fact. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=155.52s)]
*  That's a joke from a table. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=156.52s)]
*  I'm not going to make it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=159.52s)]
*  Shout out Queen Picasso. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=161.32s)]
*  She was running in a big race. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=162.76s)]
*  She came in last, bad knee. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=164.04s)]
*  But I had to watch the race. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=165.6s)]
*  I knew I was going to be watching there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=167.68s)]
*  In hindsight, I didn't even think it, because I am like a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=169.4s)]
*  big horse guy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=171.56s)]
*  But when you sent that back, I was like, yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=172.64s)]
*  I'm on ecstasy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=176.72s)]
*  I'm starting to feel it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=178.04s)]
*  Dave just sends me that text. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=179.24s)]
*  I'm like, am I inventing this? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=180.24s)]
*  There's nobody actually telling me I was a horse. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=182.04s)]
*  But it came in last. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=183.88s)]
*  I was told. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=184.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, it didn't run well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, thank god I didn't go, because you and I do [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=186.4s)]
*  Surf Lodge quite differently. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=189.12s)]
*  You were behind stage, dancing, grabbing the camera. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=191.12s)]
*  I do Surf Lodge like how I'm doing this podcast. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=195.12s)]
*  I sit down and maybe do this a little bit, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=198.16s)]
*  and that's about it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=200.6s)]
*  What if chemicals are involved? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=201.8s)]
*  I don't know if he does that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=203.96s)]
*  I think that's part of the doing it differently. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=205.4s)]
*  Do you mess with chemicals? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=206.6s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=208.44s)]
*  So I can't go. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=211.08s)]
*  If you see me, now, I used to go out a lot. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=212.96s)]

*  Yeah dude, I think. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  But are you saying that he could do better? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=504.32s)]
*  Is that what. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=507.36s)]
*  No, no, no, it depends. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=508.20000000000005s)]
*  She's, you can't do bigger or better. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=509.24s)]
*  I mean, Belichick today, he quoted, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=511.82s)]
*  He says Travis Kelzies had a lot of great catches. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=513.68s)]
*  It was the best catch he's ever made in his career. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=515.9599999999999s)]
*  Belichick is talking about Taylor. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=517.3599999999999s)]
*  That's the world. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=518.76s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=519.5999999999999s)]
*  He's Michael Jackson. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=520.42s)]
*  Andy has a mic. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=521.26s)]
*  That's what's impressive. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=522.0999999999999s)]
*  Belichick had a banger for it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=523.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's good. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=524.56s)]
*  She's the biggest person almost on the planet right now. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=525.4s)]
*  Yeah, not even close. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  But is she, like, are we, who is? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=531.52s)]
*  He wants to. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=534.68s)]
*  No, I'm trying to think like Chrissy Brinkley in her prime. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=535.8s)]
*  No, I don't think anyone would say that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=539.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but no. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=541.64s)]
*  What a long island reference that was. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=542.48s)]
*  Dude, we're having boomer moments today. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  I had a tag on my shirt and Dave, and I didn't realize it, and Dave just goes, hey, is that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  a thing now? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=554.16s)]
*  Are you leaving the tags on? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=555.16s)]
*  I honestly didn't know. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=557.08s)]
*  You're capable of anything. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=559.08s)]
*  I've seen you in the Italy looks. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=560.08s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know, maybe that's what they're doing. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=561.08s)]
*  They're wearing fucking tags on their shirts nowadays in their armpits. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=563.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  Wait, but hold on. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  Travis Kelzies, you don't get the appeal. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in terms of superficial things- [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  For Travis or for Taylor? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  For women in general. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's a cool looking guy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=572.12s)]
*  He's got everything. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=573.12s)]
*  Great looking guy, athletic, tall, rich, famous. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=574.12s)]
*  Sort of doofus. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=577.12s)]
*  No, he's kind of swaggy. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=578.12s)]
*  He's super cool to me. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=579.12s)]
*  Super cool. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=580.12s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=581.12s)]
*  That's the gayest thing I've seen on this podcast. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=582.12s)]
*  He's super cool to me. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=583.12s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=584.12s)]
*  I think you need to see color more. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=585.12s)]
*  I think he's kind of doofus. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=586.12s)]
*  For a white guy, I think it doesn't get that much cooler than Dave. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=587.12s)]
*  No, like there's different- [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=592.12s)]
*  He's not Odell Beckham Jr. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=593.12s)]
*  No, but if I'm going like what I think is cool and I'm going to do it, I'm going to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=594.12s)]
*  date myself here a little bit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=600.12s)]
*  Like Clooney, Brad Pitt, those guys are like cool. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=603.92s)]
*  I don't like Travis Kelce's style at all. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=607.92s)]
*  I think he's a little bit cringy. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=611.96s)]
*  The man had his own dating show. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=613.84s)]
*  If you have a dating show, that's a little cringy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=616.76s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=619.36s)]
*  Everyone wants to suck my dick. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=620.36s)]
*  I was going to date you. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=621.36s)]
*  Like Leonardo DiCaprio. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=622.36s)]
*  I wrote for it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=623.36s)]
*  Yeah, so there you go. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=624.36s)]
*  Prove it up. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=625.36s)]
*  Everybody says he's the coolest. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=626.6s)]
*  Leonardo DiCaprio is not doing a dating show. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=638.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=640.44s)]
*  He's a little corny to me. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=641.44s)]
*  He's a little cornball to me. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=642.44s)]
*  But Taylor may be a little bit too. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=643.88s)]
*  You think that he's corny, meaning his interests are corny, or the fact that he wants to be [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=646.04s)]
*  famous outside of being an athlete? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=650.08s)]
*  Well, I think he's addicted to fame a little bit. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=653.52s)]
*  But his quote, like, hey, supposedly this is what he said on the Maccabee show. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=657.0s)]
*  Like, hey, Taylor, I saw you rock MetLife. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=661.84s)]
*  Why don't you come see me rock Arrowhead? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=664.28s)]
*  Like lame. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=666.8s)]
*  His pickup line. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but that's fucking lame. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  I bet if you go back through your pickup lines though, you would be like, oh, God. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=672.0s)]
*  Tell me at what point in this interview where I'm like Rico Suave. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=676.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm not. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=680.72s)]
*  I'm not comparing fucking Travis Kelce to me. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=682.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm not. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm saying that to universal. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  Travis Kelce is a great looking dude. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  He's a professional athlete. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  That has great appeal. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=690.0400000000001s)]
*  I do think he's a little fucking corny. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  So what you're trying to say is that you put Taylor up so high that you expect some Rico [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=693.28s)]
*  Suave shit to catch her. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=699.96s)]
*  But maybe she doesn't want that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=700.96s)]
*  Maybe she wants somebody a little bit vulnerable. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=701.96s)]
*  He makes a great dick. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=702.96s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=703.96s)]
*  I don't know what the. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=704.96s)]
*  I didn't say something. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=705.96s)]
*  I can guess. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=706.96s)]
*  But he's a big fucking good looking professional athlete. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=708.36s)]
*  I do think, and this is before Taylor, I always thought he was a little bit corny on the field [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=710.76s)]
*  and the things he says and does. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  Like fucking the Chiefs lose a game and he's like, it's all my fault. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=718.08s)]
*  Put it on my shoulder. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=723.12s)]
*  It's like, what are you talking about? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=724.12s)]
*  You lost by 30. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=725.12s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=726.12s)]
*  Nice guy, man person. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=727.48s)]
*  So he is a nice dude. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=728.48s)]
*  But I do think he's got a decent amount of cheese ball to him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, so what happens with these guys? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=732.96s)]
*  Sorry, real quick. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  Who's your ideal match for Taylor? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  What guy? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=737.14s)]
*  You get to pick any guy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=738.14s)]
*  Yeah, what guy deserves that? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=739.14s)]
*  Relationship or not? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=740.14s)]
*  Well, I don't even know. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=741.14s)]
*  I would see her dating and it doesn't mean it's right. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=742.14s)]
*  I see her more of like a Daniel Jones guy if we're going in the NFL. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=744.34s)]
*  She seems like more along that scene. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=748.34s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=750.14s)]
*  Why are you dissing Taylor with Daniel Jones? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=752.14s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=755.14s)]
*  He's an NFL quarterback. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=757.14s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=758.14s)]
*  We know. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=759.14s)]
*  So it's not a big fucking deal. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=760.14s)]
*  You think Daniel Jones? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=761.14s)]
*  I think that's a pretty fucking good, I'm going to stay in the NFL. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=763.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=766.66s)]
*  She's got to go Brady. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=767.66s)]
*  Brady? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=768.66s)]
*  Yeah, like Brady's maybe a little old for her. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=769.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's, yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=771.86s)]
*  But Daniel Jones. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=773.06s)]
*  But it works. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=774.06s)]
*  I mean, Kelsey got two rings. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=775.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying their personalities to me are closer. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=777.26s)]

*  But who am I to fucking say God bless him? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1055.8200000000002s)]
*  But this is what happens. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1057.8200000000002s)]
*  You're fucking rich and successful now. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1058.8200000000002s)]
*  You get seduced by different things, I imagine. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1060.68s)]
*  I'm happy for her. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1063.3400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1064.94s)]
*  But you're asking me, I could have picked a million people and he wouldn't have been [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1065.94s)]
*  on the list of being like, yeah, that works. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1070.7s)]
*  I do think aside from her, he struck me as kind of like a cringey type guy that would [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1072.38s)]
*  maybe get like girls going on the Jersey Shore, DJs and shit. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1077.98s)]
*  What Travis do to you? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1084.22s)]
*  He took down one of your bitches. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1085.22s)]
*  It's gotta be something. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1086.22s)]
*  He lost a bet. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1087.22s)]
*  He lost a big bet on Travis. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1088.22s)]
*  I think what he took down is the Patriots. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1089.22s)]
*  Actually the only chief that ever beat the Pats on playoffs and Gronk's the greatest [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1094.06s)]
*  tight end of all time. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1096.86s)]
*  Oh, this is a Gronk thing. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1097.86s)]
*  This is a Gronk thing. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1098.86s)]
*  I like Travis. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1099.86s)]
*  He's my fantasy tight end. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1100.86s)]
*  Gronk was, I think, better in his peak, but Travis is long- [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1103.86s)]
*  Travis is great. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1106.6599999999999s)]
*  Gronk got beat up. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1107.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he played a long time. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1109.1399999999999s)]
*  Listen, Travis is fucking great. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1111.14s)]
*  He's a nice guy. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1112.8600000000001s)]
*  I just didn't see them together. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1114.3400000000001s)]
*  I do think he's a little corny. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1115.7s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1116.7s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being corny. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1117.7s)]
*  Nothing wrong with being corny. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1118.7s)]
*  Gronk and Taylor Swift works though. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1119.7s)]
*  Gronk and Taylor Swift, that works. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1122.7s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1124.7s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1125.7s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1126.7s)]
*  Edelman and Taylor Swift, she's too tall for a maybe. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1127.7s)]
*  Yo, I want to get back to this, but can we talk about something more straight right now? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1131.5s)]
*  Straight, what? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1135.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you met the gay guy, Obama sucked. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1136.7800000000002s)]
*  I did. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1138.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1139.3400000000001s)]
*  When I did Tucker Carlson, he was in before me. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1140.54s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1143.98s)]
*  So Tucker's day is interviewing the gay guy that sucked Obama and then immediately day [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1144.98s)]
*  four- [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1151.58s)]
*  Yeah, and then I was next. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1152.58s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1153.58s)]
*  How do you follow that? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1154.58s)]
*  I would not trust that guy as far as I could bowl. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1155.58s)]
*  He came across as the biggest fraud I've ever seen in my life. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1160.3799999999999s)]
*  We're not talking about Tucker, we're talking about the other guy. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1165.54s)]
*  And by the way, I got roasted, people like you attack Tucker because I tweet, I go, I [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1168.74s)]
*  don't trust this guy, he's full of shit. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1174.02s)]
*  I wasn't attacking Tucker, I was talking to the guy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1175.8999999999999s)]
*  This guy, the story first of all, because they're like, by the way, this guy's going [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1177.8999999999999s)]
*  to be there. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1181.82s)]
*  I never heard of him. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1182.82s)]
*  I Googled it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1183.82s)]
*  It's like, so the story is so outrageous, I don't know how it gets past the first second. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1184.82s)]
*  This guy lands in Chicago, hey, anybody want to party? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1189.8999999999999s)]
*  And Obama, like the senator, shows up, he's sucking his dick 10 minutes later. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1193.6599999999999s)]
*  It is the most ridiculous story and then you see the guy. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1197.1s)]
*  Unless you're gay. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1199.1s)]
*  And then that's just what they do. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1200.1s)]
*  I don't think that's what they do. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1201.62s)]
*  Bro, there's an app that they have where you can geotag. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1203.62s)]
*  Buddy, you're Obama. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1207.58s)]
*  What you want to do and where they are. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1208.58s)]
*  I don't care if you like, hate Obama, I think we can all admit he's an intelligent guy. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1210.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1216.3799999999999s)]
*  So you're a senator, you're sucking a stranger's dick 30 minutes later. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1217.3799999999999s)]
*  You fucked a crazy guy so that everybody calls him crazy and you're like, there's no way [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1219.3799999999999s)]
*  I did that, that's genius. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1222.34s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1223.34s)]
*  No, I don't think he did it, but that is genius. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1224.34s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1226.3s)]
*  So this is the only one? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1227.3s)]
*  He's only done once in his life? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1228.54s)]
*  With a snitch? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1230.58s)]
*  And that guy. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1231.58s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1232.58s)]
*  That guy, bro. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1233.58s)]
*  No fucking. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1234.58s)]
*  That guy, he could do way better. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1235.58s)]
*  Yeah, Barack deserves better. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1236.58s)]
*  He does deserve better. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1237.58s)]
*  There's no chance. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1238.58s)]
*  The guy he's wearing, he had like two fucking bracelets and two casts on his wrist. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1239.58s)]
*  Trust me, if you saw this guy, you'd be like, this guy is a crazy person. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1244.3799999999999s)]
*  That was my take on him. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1248.22s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1249.78s)]
*  Okay, but what we were talking about earlier was that, and you've been the victim of this, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1251.5s)]
*  is there's like a smear campaign, it feels towards Obama right now, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1256.66s)]
*  Out of nowhere, the internet's like, did Michelle actually give birth to their kids? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1262.42s)]
*  Is Michelle a man? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1266.82s)]
*  Then the chef dies and they try to act like the chef was his boyfriend. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1267.82s)]
*  There's this big smear campaign going. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1271.62s)]
*  So it happens both ways. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1273.28s)]
*  A lot of times we- [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1274.28s)]
*  Both sides are fucking equally toxic. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1275.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1276.86s)]
*  No doubt about that. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1277.86s)]
*  I've been doing that from day one with any, whenever I get, it's like, I hate fucking [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1278.9399999999998s)]
*  both sides. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1281.82s)]
*  Listen, for most people, you look at me, I go on Fox, I don't get invited on any of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1282.82s)]
*  the networks. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1287.1s)]
*  They'll be like, Dave's conservative, he's fucking, leans to the right. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1288.1s)]
*  But if I say one thing that the right doesn't agree with, they're all over it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1292.06s)]
*  They savage me just as hard. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1296.1s)]
*  They're both equally fucking crazy. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1297.6599999999999s)]
*  Because that's the thing that people are, is like, they will prop you up as long as [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  you agree, but they're not true fans. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1302.78s)]
*  No. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1304.62s)]
*  Your true fans will understand who you are as a whole person. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1305.62s)]
*  A three dimensional person. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1307.98s)]
*  Exactly, right? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1308.98s)]
*  Left and right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1309.98s)]
*  But the ones that are just kind of using you as a mascot, the second you divert from them [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1310.98s)]
*  at all- [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1314.54s)]
*  That just is brutal. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1315.54s)]
*  And I've always said, I never want anybody to know the answer to a question, how I'm [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1316.54s)]
*  gonna answer a question before I answer it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1321.86s)]
*  That's the worst. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1324.1399999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, both sides, you know their answers. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1325.1399999999999s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1328.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you tell me who's writing the article, I know what it's gonna say before I answer. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1329.6599999999999s)]
*  But that's the thing that I think people do, is like, a lot of times people get famous [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1332.06s)]
*  enough to the point where there's so many clicks in writing a hit piece about them, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1335.98s)]
*  right? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1341.9399999999998s)]
*  I wonder if the Washington Post, the Times, whatever, all these different, left, right, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1342.9399999999998s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1349.34s)]
*  I wonder if it's almost like tickets for a cop. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1350.34s)]
*  Like at the end of the month or the end of the quarter, you need to hit your quota. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1353.62s)]
*  And if you didn't get your views, well, I think we need to do a hit piece on Rogan. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1356.6599999999999s)]
*  I think we need to do a hit piece on- [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1360.58s)]
*  100%. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1361.9399999999998s)]
*  I think we need to do a hit piece on Elon. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1362.9399999999998s)]
*  They know that that is guaranteed 10 million clicks and maybe they have to hit that for [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1364.3799999999999s)]
*  their contract. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1368.26s)]
*  I don't know if that's what it is, but it would not surprise me. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1369.26s)]
*  I know it was part of Business Insider. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1371.1s)]
*  I know that was part of it, I've seen it. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1373.62s)]
*  And a lot of times, because what I do, which is probably depending on how you look at it, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1375.54s)]
*  I a lot of times will engage with, what does what, more clicks for the people attacking [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1380.58s)]
*  me. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1384.6999999999998s)]
*  So they know that- [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1385.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1386.6999999999998s)]
*  And- [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1387.6999999999998s)]
*  He's not targeted because he always responds to those. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1388.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like, this guy's fucking easy money for clicks. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1389.6999999999998s)]
*  But the people that ignore, that don't have a platform, you will let those media outlets [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1392.78s)]
*  decide who you are to the public. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1398.06s)]
*  Totally. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1400.02s)]
*  So I understand why you do it, but now you're the perfect target for them if they want to [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1401.02s)]
*  get you something. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1404.26s)]
*  And a lot of times they're behind paywalls. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1405.26s)]
*  They're literally trying to make money on you. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1406.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's the most fucked up shit. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1407.9s)]
*  The first side though is when you do that, people love you more. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1409.38s)]
*  Your fans love you more because you're transparent. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1411.66s)]
*  100%. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1413.7s)]
*  So it almost works semiotically even if you don't mean for you. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1414.7s)]
*  Yeah, like our pizza event, I think people are more fired up, psyched to be there because [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1417.54s)]
*  of all the controversy surrounding it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1422.46s)]
*  So real quick, what I think happens is when people get famous, they retreat to safety. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1425.5s)]
*  Because if you're in the middle, you get attacked by both sides, right? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1430.56s)]
*  Because you can get both of them clicks. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1433.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1434.02s)]
*  If you're your own unique individual person, which most people fucking are. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1435.02s)]
*  But the second you get famous, you gotta go, okay, I can't take all this backlash. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1438.3400000000001s)]
*  Let me just become left or become right. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1442.46s)]
*  And that is my security blanket. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1444.26s)]
*  That's my shield. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1445.68s)]
*  The problem with that is you lose your individuality. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1446.68s)]
*  It's like when you see these actors and stuff like that, they go, okay, I cannot be criticized [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1450.38s)]
*  constantly. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1454.9s)]
*  I just am gonna go with or toe the company line or whatever the fuck that is for Hollywood. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1455.9s)]
*  Because life is easier and I'm gonna continue to make moves. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1460.46s)]
*  Also the floor is higher. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1462.5s)]
*  You can be a lot more broke trying to be in the middle. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1463.8600000000001s)]
*  But if you're always catering to one side, I'm gonna get money from that side. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1466.18s)]
*  100%. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1468.98s)]
*  And I think the bigger your star personality becomes, most of these people start surrounding [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1469.98s)]
*  themselves. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1475.74s)]
*  You have PR teams, you have all these people with what I think is horrible advice generally [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1476.74s)]
*  giving to it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1480.08s)]
*  But it's like the person is almost just letting others around them dictate how to handle. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1481.08s)]
*  No PR team would tell their client to call the person that's writing a hit piece about [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1485.8s)]
*  them and record it and put it out. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1491.28s)]
*  Because that's not how they think. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  They're risk averse. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1495.1599999999999s)]
*  How do we calm this down? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1496.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's distract, kill a story with a story or something like that. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1497.4399999999998s)]
*  But the reality is, is that when somebody is out for blood for you, as human beings, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1500.08s)]
*  I think we enjoy seeing the person get vengeance. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1504.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1508.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm a vengeance guy. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1510.28s)]
*  And even when I called the Washington Post, it wasn't some grand plan. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1511.28s)]
*  The email was sent to me maybe 20 minutes beforehand. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1513.4s)]
*  Can you break down the setup? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1515.68s)]
*  So you're doing the pizza festival. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1517.3400000000001s)]
*  So we're doing a pizza festival. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1518.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's been in the works probably like four or five months. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1520.96s)]
*  Tons of work. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1524.28s)]
*  The medium rare guys, we're getting all the best pizza places, all the ovens, rented a [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1525.28s)]
*  stadium. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1529.76s)]
*  The context of this is like all these different pizza places from what, tri-state area? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1530.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1535.16s)]
*  For the most part. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1536.16s)]
*  I've done your one bite review. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1537.64s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1538.64s)]
*  And I know most of the pizzerias. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1539.64s)]
*  I've met them. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1540.76s)]
*  I'm friends with them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1541.76s)]
*  I've scored them. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1542.76s)]
*  I've helped a lot of them. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1543.76s)]
*  So I- [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1544.76s)]
*  These are the superstars. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1545.76s)]
*  Yeah, fairly close knit. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1546.76s)]
*  They're going to come and they're going to go to this stadium. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1547.76s)]
*  And they're going to recreate the kitchens. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1549.28s)]
*  Now, very difficult because if you are excellent at your craft, you're particular about your [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1551.4s)]
*  fucking oven, the temperature, the size, whatever. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1556.52s)]
*  This is a pain in the ass fucking thing to produce. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1558.8000000000002s)]
*  So I never thought we'd actually ever be able to do it because of that reason. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1560.0800000000002s)]
*  There was a few that were there that I was like- [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1563.68s)]
*  Safara, Lucali, John Zabrica. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1565.88s)]
*  Lucali one I was like, I couldn't believe it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1566.88s)]
*  Sally's, you name it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1569.88s)]
*  DeLorenzo's. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1571.44s)]
*  John Pepe's. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1572.44s)]
*  Frank Pepe's, excuse me. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1573.44s)]
*  It was- [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1574.44s)]
*  It was the thing. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1575.44s)]
*  It was- [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1576.44s)]
*  The best of the best pizza you can have. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1577.44s)]
*  So this is a big thing to put together. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1579.5600000000002s)]
*  This is not, hey, we're going to throw some pizzas in boxes and then deliver them to a [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1581.72s)]
*  park and then everybody grabs a slice. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1585.2s)]
*  This is the fucking- [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1587.2s)]
*  We looked at it and it looked like mini storefronts basically. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1588.2s)]
*  We let them pick their ovens. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1590.92s)]
*  We went out and so there were all sorts of different types of ovens. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1592.5600000000002s)]
*  It was a big production to put together. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1595.36s)]
*  And then probably like a week, week and a half, it started this dude, Kenji Alt Lopez, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1598.76s)]
*  who I'd never heard of, celebrity chef. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1606.56s)]
*  Like a million-dollar YouTube channel, 600 Instagram, and he started publicly tagging [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1609.6s)]
*  the pizza places and being like, how the fuck can you support Dave Portnoy and all the hit [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1617.6s)]
*  pieces that have been written, quoting them, including like I'm a union buster, all this [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1623.0800000000002s)]
*  stuff. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1627.52s)]
*  And just going crazy. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1628.52s)]
*  He was also friends with the Washington Post. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1630.3600000000001s)]
*  So- [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1632.2s)]
*  Where's his animosity for you coming from? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1633.2s)]
*  This is a crazy political human. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1635.28s)]
*  So I didn't realize- [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1637.3400000000001s)]
*  So his identity is politics. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1638.3400000000001s)]
*  Which I didn't realize. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1640.0s)]
*  He actually, during COVID, he had to take this down and apologize and it's always the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1641.0s)]
*  same. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1645.48s)]
*  He basically said, if you support Trump, it's no different than being a Nazi or wearing [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1646.48s)]
*  a white hood, like in the KKK. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1652.1s)]
*  If you come to my restaurant, he won't serve you. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1653.8999999999999s)]
*  So that's the vibe. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1656.78s)]
*  And I have clearly been perceived as, well, Dave interviewed Trump, all that shit. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1658.7s)]
*  So that was where it was coming from, in every hit piece. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1663.56s)]
*  So he was going crazy posting it, posting, tagging, shaming the pizza places and his [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1666.46s)]
*  sponsors. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1673.7s)]
*  And he's getting rewarded from his followers and he gets to feel like a hero. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1674.7s)]
*  And he blocks everybody. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1676.98s)]
*  He doesn't allow comments. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1678.3s)]
*  It's an echo chamber of just his world. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1679.3s)]
*  And there's two authors of the Washington Post article, Emily Heal. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1682.74s)]
*  And then Tom Karma Man. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1687.8600000000001s)]
*  Guess who he's a super fan of? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1690.46s)]
*  Kenji Al Lopez. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1691.9s)]
*  Oh, well, well, well. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1692.9s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1694.38s)]
*  Like he had this guy, the other author had one picture on his Instagram that wasn't himself. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1695.38s)]
*  It was Kenji. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1699.8600000000001s)]
*  That's the only one. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1700.8600000000001s)]
*  So shocking how that works. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1701.8600000000001s)]
*  And what was this? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1704.98s)]
*  On Thursday before the festival, or maybe Wednesday, I forget, but we get an email from [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1706.5800000000002s)]
*  a sponsor sent to me being like, heads up, the Washington Post is writing an article [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1711.86s)]
*  about the festival and they basically sent an email. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1716.54s)]
*  Hey, we want to talk to you about supporting the pizza fest and being involved with Dave, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1719.58s)]
*  who is a racist. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1724.7s)]
*  Here comes the word I can't pronounce. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1726.3s)]
*  Machosanist. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1727.78s)]
*  I can't pronounce it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1728.78s)]
*  He made it Hebrew. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1729.78s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1730.78s)]
*  I cannot pronounce it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1731.78s)]
*  I'll never be able to pronounce it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1732.78s)]
*  The fact that she didn't correct him one time made her quite likeable. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1733.78s)]
*  She could have. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1739.3799999999999s)]
*  Somebody who is as unfamiliar with that term would never be able to pronounce it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1740.38s)]
*  Misogynist. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1746.38s)]
*  Misogynist. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1747.38s)]
*  Misogynist. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1748.38s)]
*  You're losing it already. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1749.38s)]
*  And basically sent the email to the advertiser, I was being like, please defend yourself, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1752.3000000000002s)]
*  putting them in a box. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1756.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1757.5400000000002s)]
*  What the fuck is a sponsor supposed to say to that? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1758.5400000000002s)]
*  How could you support a pizza fest that is run by a misogynist and a racist? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1760.5s)]
*  But they're also sending it to a bunch of old school Italians. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1765.7800000000002s)]
*  Finally, finally. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1768.38s)]
*  This was a major blue chip sponsor, the one that's sent to us. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1774.38s)]
*  So these are the sponsors, not the actual kids. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1779.7s)]
*  Yes, but they did it to everybody. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1781.3400000000001s)]
*  And she put her number to call back on. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1785.0200000000002s)]
*  So that was sent to me. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1787.0200000000002s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1788.2600000000002s)]
*  I'm just going to call this woman and see what the deal is. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1789.46s)]
*  Watching her melt. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1793.2600000000002s)]
*  And the call went as bad really for her as it possibly could because right off the bat, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1795.14s)]
*  I'm like, why are you sending this email saying I'm the M word and because I can't pronounce [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1800.42s)]
*  it and racist. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1804.3s)]
*  And she's like, I didn't do that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1805.3s)]
*  I haven't done that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1806.86s)]
*  Well, let me read you the email. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1807.86s)]
*  I read her the email. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1809.82s)]
*  She goes, oh, I just did that once. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1810.82s)]
*  I'm like, that's weird. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1811.82s)]
*  You just said you didn't do it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1812.82s)]
*  And I just read it to you. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1813.82s)]
*  And then the conversation continued. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1815.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, do you know anything about me? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1817.1s)]
*  She's like, no. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1818.74s)]
*  I'm like, well, then how could you send this email if you don't know anything about me? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1819.74s)]
*  She's like, well, we're going to talk to you later, which they weren't and continued on. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1823.38s)]
*  She's like, and then the journalistic tactic. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1828.42s)]
*  That was she said, we only send something negative to try to get people to engage. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1830.5s)]
*  It's a journalistic tactic. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1836.98s)]
*  I'm like, well, that's fucking so shit. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1838.22s)]
*  So it's almost as if she's admitting that her form of journalism is to manipulate the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1840.14s)]
*  person she's interviewing to satisfy the angle of the article. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1848.9s)]
*  Which is no integrity in the journalism. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1852.94s)]
*  It's I'm going to prompt you so that you react to this prompt so I can take that one sound [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1855.1s)]
*  bite and be like, yes, we are aware that he does this stuff and we really questioned it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1859.66s)]
*  But maybe for the greater good, we thought it was okay. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1863.5s)]
*  So now she's confirming who it is. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1865.62s)]
*  But on the phone, I couldn't believe she said it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1867.82s)]
*  Me neither. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1870.02s)]
*  She was just like, yeah, we fake stories. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1871.02s)]
*  That's the kind of way that I interpret it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1873.46s)]
*  They've trick baited most journalism. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1874.46s)]
*  Bro, 100%. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1875.46s)]
*  I wonder if they have to compete with YouTube now. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1876.46s)]
*  I wonder if journalists are like the only way that they can get people to watch their [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1878.98s)]
*  video reports or even read their essays is that if they compete with the click bait of [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1882.38s)]
*  YouTube. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1886.9s)]
*  It's all click bait. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1887.9s)]
*  And then she also did something which has been almost my biggest complaint. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1888.9s)]
*  There's so many hit pieces. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1893.02s)]
*  They're all the same shit. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1894.02s)]
*  The hit piece reads the other hit piece and prints it as though it is fact. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1895.42s)]
*  And how would anybody actually know if it's true or not? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1898.8600000000001s)]
*  Because they haven't done the research to dig into. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1901.14s)]
*  It's like I've offered to everybody. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1903.18s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1905.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm an open book. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1906.3000000000002s)]
*  Put a camera. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1907.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do every point. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1908.94s)]
*  And an open mind at the end is going to be like, this is garbage. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1909.94s)]
*  How has this ever been printed about him? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1911.86s)]
*  But she said, I'll sit down with you at 10 a.m. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1913.78s)]
*  And she picked the time. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1916.02s)]
*  She's like 10 a.m. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1917.02s)]
*  I agreed to it knowing the piece was already written. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1918.02s)]
*  And then they canceled that and they're like, we want to move it to 5 p.m. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1921.3s)]
*  Well, the article has to come out in like five minutes. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1925.4199999999998s)]
*  So why would I agree to that? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1928.86s)]
*  I didn't understand the angle right there, but I guess it's they wanted to call with [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1931.02s)]
*  you after the article would already be printed. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1935.02s)]
*  And you were trying to beat the article so that you could at least get a fair shake. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1937.78s)]
*  And by the way, journalists, that's the thing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  They don't want the fair shake because it puts them at risk. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1943.54s)]
*  If you're printing something, you can always plead ignorance. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1947.06s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1950.74s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1951.74s)]
*  You can't say that if you've spoken with me and I've basically given you facts and proof [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1952.74s)]
*  and evidence that contradicts what you're writing. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1958.02s)]
*  OK, that's why they don't want the subject. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1960.3799999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second because this episode is sponsored by [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1962.18s)]
*  SeatGeek. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1966.3799999999999s)]
*  OK, if you need to get some tickets to, I don't know, for example, your boys shows up [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  in Toronto this coming weekend, Scotiabank Arena, both of them sold out. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1973.1799999999998s)]
*  But you could go grab some tickets over there at SeatGeek. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1978.78s)]
*  If there's any event that you want to go do and you can't get tickets, you use SeatGeek [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1981.02s)]
*  and SeatGeek has your back. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1985.6599999999999s)]
*  How do they have your back? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1987.06s)]
*  Well, they will tell you if that price for the ticket is a good deal or a bad deal. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1988.06s)]
*  Just look at those dots. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1992.1399999999999s)]
*  That green dot is go. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1993.1399999999999s)]
*  That red dot is hey. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1994.1399999999999s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1996.6200000000001s)]
*  You better really want to go to this because you're getting bullied a little bit on the [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1997.6200000000001s)]
*  price. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=1999.82s)]
*  So what I'm telling you right now is SeatGeek is the place that we go when we're trying [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2000.82s)]
*  to get tickets for those events that we cannot get tickets for. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2006.26s)]
*  And right now, all you have to do if you're a flagrant supporter, is you download the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2009.78s)]
*  SeatGeek app and you make sure that you use our code flagrant and you're getting $20 off [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2016.14s)]
*  at SeatGeek. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2021.18s)]
*  So think about that. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2022.18s)]
*  You get a $20 better ticket. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2023.58s)]
*  You get a little closer to the action. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2025.22s)]
*  Maybe you get to bring a friend. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2027.14s)]
*  You both split it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2028.18s)]
*  Whatever it is, you get $20 off. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2029.18s)]
*  Have a little bit more enjoyment in that event. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2031.7s)]
*  Take that $20 off and you know what? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2035.18s)]
*  Go buy some beers. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2037.18s)]
*  Maybe one single beer. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2039.48s)]
*  Whatever it is, you got it with the $20. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2041.5s)]
*  So go get SeatGeek and make sure you use that code flagrant. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2043.82s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2046.5s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2048.18s)]
*  Stop everything because our friends at FreezePipe just launched a bunch of new products and [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2049.18s)]
*  you need to know about them. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2052.7s)]
*  First of all, if you want the coolest, smoothest way to smoke, and I don't just mean cool like [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2054.1s)]
*  it's cool. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2058.5s)]
*  I mean cool like that burning lung feeling that most of us hate when we smoke weed. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2059.5s)]
*  And even though I don't smoke often, I fucking hate those burning lungs. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2064.18s)]
*  FreezePipe takes care of that. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2067.2999999999997s)]
*  And they have a newly released mini bong and tornado bong that are priced very affordably [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2068.98s)]
*  and punch well above their weight class. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2073.38s)]
*  So if you want to do that or if you prefer smoking out of joints, blunts, vapes, whatever, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2075.42s)]
*  FreezePipe's new glycerin blunt tip brings that much needed icy glycerin coldness to [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2080.02s)]
*  smoke in any kind of joint, blunt, or vape. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2086.1s)]
*  So shop for the smoothest pipes, the coldest bongs, whatever you need to do it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2088.14s)]
*  TheFreezepipe.com. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2091.66s)]
*  That is TheFreezepipe.com. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2093.66s)]
*  And if you use the code flagrant, you get 15% off your entire order. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2097.14s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2100.78s)]
*  So again, that is TheFreezepipe.com. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2101.78s)]
*  Use the code flagrant for 15% off. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2104.98s)]
*  So stop today and start fighting fire with ice. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2108.18s)]
*  Game of Thrones type shit. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2110.7799999999997s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2111.7799999999997s)]
*  You own a media company. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2112.7799999999997s)]
*  How do you instill the journalistic practices that you want with your employees? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2113.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so we don't do that type of gotcha, catcha journalism. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2119.2599999999998s)]
*  But having said that- [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2124.06s)]
*  Would you push back if you felt like there was- [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2125.86s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2127.94s)]
*  You know that girl who's blowing up Bobby Altaf? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2128.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2130.8199999999997s)]
*  So we had her on BFFs. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2131.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2134.02s)]
*  Okay, you started drama with- [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2135.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2136.5s)]
*  So we asked her, did she sleep with Drake? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2137.5s)]
*  And she answered, no, this is a text. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2144.1800000000003s)]
*  So we had her on the show, the Drake stuff broke after. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2146.38s)]
*  But since I knew her, I texted her, I'm like, hey, I'm hearing you slept with Drake and [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2148.94s)]
*  you got a divorce. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2154.2200000000003s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2155.2200000000003s)]
*  Kind of joking. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2156.2200000000003s)]
*  She's like, off the record? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2157.2200000000003s)]
*  No, not true. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2159.82s)]
*  And something else. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2161.86s)]
*  We retold this story on BFFs next week and our editors edited it and made it appear- [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2163.5s)]
*  Kind of senior. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2170.78s)]
*  Like she was about to confirm something salacious and it went uber viral. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2171.78s)]
*  I went ballistic on my social team. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2176.3s)]
*  I don't want clicks. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2178.74s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2179.74s)]
*  I don't- [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2180.74s)]
*  Good feel. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2181.74s)]
*  I don't know, Dave. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2182.74s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2183.74s)]
*  Because you know what that clip was gonna do. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2184.74s)]
*  But I didn't do it. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2186.26s)]
*  But- [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2188.3s)]
*  Even before, no, even before it became a big story, I had her ripped him apart. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2189.3s)]
*  When she says off the record, if you talk about this off the record conversation, then [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2192.3799999999997s)]
*  you know what that was gonna do. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2196.9399999999996s)]
*  No, no, it isn't. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2197.9399999999996s)]
*  Because the actual- [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2198.9399999999996s)]
*  No, here it isn't. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2199.9399999999996s)]
*  Because the actual clip, it was all together. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2201.8199999999997s)]
*  So when we were filming, she said off the record, ha ha, no, it's not true. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2204.8599999999997s)]
*  I said, here's the response, ha ha, off the record, it's not true. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2210.98s)]
*  I said it all together, they cut me. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2213.98s)]
*  Like the clip cut me. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2216.9599999999996s)]
*  His point would be, and I'm a fan, but I have to say this. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2218.54s)]
*  His point would be, if she says off the record, it's off the record. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2221.66s)]
*  No, I disagree. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2225.94s)]
*  If she says off the record, no, it's not true. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2229.54s)]
*  Yeah, a misogynist would say that. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2233.14s)]
*  A mischievous would definitely say something like that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2235.2999999999997s)]
*  She says, no, it's off the record. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2239.1s)]
*  If she says off the record, no, it's not true, together those two don't mean anything. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2243.2599999999998s)]
*  If she said off the record, yeah, I slept with him, I never would have gone at all. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2247.46s)]
*  She's being sarcastic. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2251.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2253.46s)]
*  Off the record, no, it's not true. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2254.46s)]
*  Correct. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2256.7400000000002s)]
*  Off the record, yeah, it's true. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2257.7400000000002s)]
*  Don't mention it. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2259.38s)]
*  You don't have to have something off the record if it never happened. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2260.38s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2263.3s)]
*  She wants that lie to be out, or that rumor to be out there because it's all about her. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2264.3s)]
*  No, she clearly didn't because she went nuts. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2268.78s)]
*  Because she didn't address the rumor. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2270.98s)]
*  No, no, no, you guys are saying it differently. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2271.98s)]
*  What Al is saying is she would like people to think it might have happened. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2274.82s)]
*  She definitely didn't, she went crazy. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2278.08s)]
*  But I understand the sarcasm here. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2280.14s)]
*  If I'm like off the record, never had sex with Paris Hilton. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2285.22s)]
*  You're like, you don't need to tell me that off the record. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2289.2599999999998s)]
*  Correct, it was like she didn't say shit. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2291.2599999999998s)]
*  It was like, did you sleep with Drake and your marriage is ruined? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2293.3799999999997s)]
*  She's like, off the record, no. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2298.02s)]
*  Like okay, that's what it was. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2300.14s)]
*  Can I push back one more time? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2301.14s)]
*  Push back, I'm going to dunk on you, but go. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2302.18s)]
*  I don't mind, I'm 5'7", I've been dunked on. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2304.18s)]
*  Off the record, you're kind of interpreting the tone of it through a text message of this [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2308.06s)]
*  being sarcastic. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2312.54s)]
*  Correct. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2313.54s)]
*  But no, it's an interview. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2314.54s)]
*  No, it's a text. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2315.54s)]
*  No, it's a text. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2316.54s)]
*  She said off the record, no, it's not true. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2317.54s)]
*  You read it back in the video now. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2321.18s)]
*  You have kind of interpreted the tone as being sarcastic. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2322.82s)]
*  Did you know that it was beforehand? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2326.38s)]
*  No, here's my point. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2328.58s)]
*  You don't have to say off the record, no, I didn't sleep with Drake. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2331.9s)]
*  To be joking. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2338.4199999999996s)]
*  Can you just tell me something right now? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2339.4199999999996s)]
*  Off the record, how do you feel about Travis Kelsey? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2341.4199999999996s)]
*  Big fan. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2346.4199999999996s)]
*  Off the record, I've never committed murder. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2347.4199999999996s)]
*  Off the record, yeah. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2352.4199999999996s)]
*  Now, if you wanted people to think that you were a murderer. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2355.4199999999996s)]
*  If I wanted people to think I'm a murderer. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2359.4199999999996s)]
*  If you're a rapper that's a gangster rapper, you want them to think that you're dangerous [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2361.4199999999996s)]
*  and violent, and you go, off the record, I never even committed murder. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2364.06s)]
*  I never even held a gun. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2367.66s)]
*  That would be bad to put out there in the world. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2369.3799999999997s)]
*  So if we're assuming that Bobby wanted, this is interesting, if we're assuming that Bobby [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2371.62s)]
*  wanted people to think maybe something happened. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2377.54s)]
*  Now it was exposed that nothing happened, and it's the opposite drama. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2381.18s)]
*  But she still didn't want that to be out there. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2387.22s)]
*  Because now she has to clarify that she never slept with him, and now that can't be out [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2389.62s)]
*  there in the ether, which might have been the fun thing. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2393.06s)]
*  Yeah, you guys are going down already. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2394.8599999999997s)]
*  We're going like a rabbit hole. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2396.78s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is- [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2399.78s)]
*  This one's real journalism too, Dave. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2401.38s)]
*  We got to get to the bottom of this. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2403.38s)]
*  The fact of the matter is she was mad that it spiraled a rumor that they actually fucked. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2404.78s)]
*  And then there was like- [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2409.98s)]
*  I don't know what happened then. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2411.9s)]
*  Now they gotta fuck. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2413.42s)]
*  No, well now they know he followed each other. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2414.42s)]
*  Something happened with them. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2415.86s)]
*  What happened? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2416.86s)]
*  What happened? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2417.86s)]
*  What is it? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2418.86s)]
*  What is it? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2419.86s)]
*  That's what prompted something to happen. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2420.86s)]
*  That's what prompted it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2421.86s)]
*  But there was a lot of talk about it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2422.86s)]
*  Something happened. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2424.34s)]
*  Something happened. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2425.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2426.34s)]
*  Something happened close to it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2427.34s)]
*  Some weird shit over there. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2428.34s)]
*  We gotta get to the bottom of that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2429.34s)]
*  For the sake of clarity, the way this went down is they did the interview together when [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2430.34s)]

*  It's like three on one fucking handicap match. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2481.74s)]
*  Of all the things that we were going to talk about today, I think it was Bobby Althoff's [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2486.3399999999997s)]
*  interview. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2491.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay, so you put out a statement, or your team put out a statement, which seemed kind [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2492.3399999999997s)]
*  of like you put it out. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2498.4199999999996s)]
*  What? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2499.4199999999996s)]
*  The written statement that was posted. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2500.4199999999996s)]
*  Was it still in Althoff? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2502.18s)]
*  No, no, this is when you, the Washington Post, and you were talking about journalistic integrity [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2503.18s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2507.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2508.7799999999997s)]
*  It was great. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2510.26s)]
*  The team poured it on. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2511.26s)]
*  Yeah, team poured it on. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2512.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2513.26s)]
*  Okay, what is, at what point, not us, cuz we're grandfathered in to thinking the New [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2514.26s)]
*  York Times really matters, the Washington Post really matters. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2520.9s)]
*  We're old people that when we see something printed on paper, we're like, this must be [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2523.02s)]
*  the truth, this is real. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2526.2200000000003s)]
*  I wonder if teenagers now, they're growing up constantly seeing the president criticize [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2527.7400000000002s)]
*  the news, the left criticize the news, the right criticize the news. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2533.1800000000003s)]
*  Cuz keep in mind, when we were growing up, it was The Daily Show saying everything coming [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2535.82s)]
*  out from the right was a lie and fake. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2539.34s)]
*  And now you see the right saying, hey, look at mainstream media, look how much they are [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2541.5s)]
*  liars and fake. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2545.86s)]
*  So this generation's coming up going, everything that we're seeing, we should be skeptical [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2546.86s)]
*  of. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2551.02s)]
*  Do they start looking at the New York Times and Washington Post, and do they just go, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2552.02s)]
*  do they never have a baked in trust of it? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2555.38s)]
*  I don't think they do, and I think just the way people consume media is so different that [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2558.3s)]
*  I don't even know they grow up on that. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2562.5s)]
*  I literally grew up in a household, the Times is gossible. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2564.1000000000004s)]
*  If something was said in the Times, it was true, same with Washington Post. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2567.26s)]
*  My dad, I've said it many times, he's a liberal guy, hated Trump. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2571.26s)]
*  He has begrudgingly come to grips with the fact that I think it hurts him to the core [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2575.1200000000003s)]
*  that the media slanted. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2581.3s)]
*  He knows now Washington Post, if he picks it up, it's gonna be negative to me. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2583.86s)]
*  It's a big change. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2588.82s)]
*  It's a big change to see that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2590.0200000000004s)]
*  You know what might have basically killed journalists in integrity is Craigslist, cuz [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2591.26s)]
*  that's what sunk in newspapers. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2594.94s)]
*  They made so much money off the classifieds, Craigslist, people would just put their shit [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2596.46s)]
*  on there for free. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2600.0s)]
*  Newspapers started taking crazy hits, layoffs everywhere. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2601.62s)]
*  Now they're trying to make money however they can. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2603.54s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2606.26s)]
*  See, my question is whether it's just always been that way. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2607.26s)]
*  There's more media now to expose it and go backwards. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2610.7400000000002s)]
*  I would have had no voice to fight what is going on. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2615.78s)]
*  So you look at all these incidents throughout history that got us into wars, like the Gulf [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2618.66s)]
*  of Tonkin thing that happened with Vietnam, right? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2622.7s)]
*  This fake thing doesn't happen. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2624.66s)]
*  No ship sunk and all of a sudden we're in a war, right? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2625.66s)]
*  There was no podcast for some people to go, yo, I don't think a boat really got exploded. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2628.54s)]
*  Where are the dead Americans? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2634.7s)]
*  Does anybody have a cousin that was over there that didn't come back? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2636.2599999999998s)]
*  So now that there is, you could make the argument that back in the day, there was mutual benefit [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2639.22s)]
*  for everybody being on the same side of what maybe the military industrial complex, whatever [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2646.2599999999998s)]
*  the fuck you wanna say. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2651.58s)]
*  Whatever the government wanted to push through. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2652.58s)]
*  But now the fact that you have all these other independent media sources out here, we don't [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2654.24s)]
*  look like loony bins. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2657.3599999999997s)]
*  Conspiracy bins. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2658.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's the same with a lot of things, like sports. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2659.3599999999997s)]
*  Like athletes now have their own vehicle to get their own perspective out, whether it's [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2661.16s)]
*  on Twitter or X, whatever you wanna call it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2666.3399999999997s)]
*  Before it was newspaper writers who would dictate the perception of an athlete. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2668.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  And now they're starting their own podcast. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2673.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2674.7999999999997s)]
*  The, what's the, Ryan Clark one's fire. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2675.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2677.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a bunch of athlete podcasts that are great. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2678.8399999999997s)]
*  Also the pivot. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2679.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, pivot is great. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2680.8399999999997s)]
*  Even the Manning Bros are great. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2681.8399999999997s)]
*  We have a Pat Bet podcast. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2684.64s)]
*  All the smoke. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2685.64s)]
*  Roan, Pat, first of all, Roan is fucking genius. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2686.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2689.0s)]
*  Like I was watching all his battle rap stuff before. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2690.0s)]
*  And then the two of them together are fantastic. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2692.36s)]
*  And yeah, that's one of the weird podcasts that I can actually watch if it's through [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2694.92s)]
*  Zoom. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2700.36s)]
*  Like usually I can't do the Zoom pods, but for now I can fuck with it. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2701.36s)]
*  But yeah, it's like, I guess now we're in the age of, we don't need experts on the thing [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2705.36s)]
*  to talk about it. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2711.16s)]
*  We can get it right from the source. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2712.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2714.48s)]
*  So all that changes. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2715.48s)]
*  I tend to think media has always been, history is written by the winners. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2718.0400000000004s)]
*  Like that is for the most part, always been true. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2722.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2725.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2726.88s)]
*  So I call you after I read this article. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2727.88s)]
*  It says you bought back Barstool. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2731.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2733.0800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2734.0800000000004s)]
*  I call you on FaceTime. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2735.0800000000004s)]
*  We have yet another boomer moment between the two of us where he's getting a million [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2736.0800000000004s)]
*  fucking calls, obviously. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2739.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2740.84s)]
*  I know how to exactly stop the calls. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2742.4s)]
*  So the FaceTime is just going like blur every two seconds. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2743.56s)]
*  Because this is like a minute after it was fucking announced. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2747.6800000000003s)]
*  And I never got to say this to you, but what I liked about it is most people start a business [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2751.1200000000003s)]
*  now and they're looking for an exit and they cultivate a community and they kind of like [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2756.76s)]
*  lie sometimes or maybe not lie, but manipulate a little bit. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2762.7200000000003s)]
*  Hey, we're in this together. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2766.6000000000004s)]
*  Hey, we're team this. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2767.6000000000004s)]
*  We got to all make this product great, but they're doing it all so they can get an exit [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2769.24s)]
*  from the Saudi fucking fund or whatever the hell it is. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2773.3199999999997s)]
*  And you were off. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2776.7999999999997s)]
*  You didn't have to come back. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2779.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2781.8399999999997s)]
*  And the fact that you came back, I was so excited because I can imagine being a Barstool [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2782.8399999999997s)]
*  fan for 10 years going, we weren't lied to. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2788.68s)]
*  He cared about the community and he wants this to continue. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2792.9199999999996s)]
*  And he understands that if he doesn't take the helm, that maybe it falls apart. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2797.24s)]
*  And I thought it was a really fucking dope thing for a chief to do that doesn't have [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2802.3799999999997s)]
*  to do it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2809.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2810.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2811.4399999999996s)]
*  So the only thing I can correct there is I was very, very honest and upfront the entire [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2812.4399999999996s)]
*  time that I did want to fuck off. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2817.3199999999997s)]
*  I told our community that. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2820.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to make a fucking ton of money and I'm going to be like, poof, like [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2821.24s)]
*  fucking usual suspects. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2825.04s)]
*  But you didn't. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2826.04s)]
*  And so say on a beach, I I would have, I was slowly phasing out the way the situation came [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2827.84s)]
*  about. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2834.92s)]
*  My company would have been in big trouble. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2837.52s)]
*  I think a lot of people are going to lay it off fired. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2839.44s)]
*  I have fucking morons at work for me. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2841.64s)]
*  What the fuck are they going to do? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2843.6s)]
*  Bad groceries. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2845.18s)]
*  They've been living this life. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2846.18s)]
*  So I was at a crossroads to, I guess what you're saying do, because I, I could have [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2847.6s)]
*  made a shit ton of money, gone on my way. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2853.68s)]
*  I would have left Barcelona, I think in a very vulnerable, bad spot. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2856.3599999999997s)]
*  I didn't want to do that. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  I would have never, if I thought they were solid and it would have continued, then maybe [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2860.3999999999996s)]
*  I would have fucked off. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2865.7599999999998s)]
*  But I knew it needed me to be back to make sure the company was secure, the community [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2866.7599999999998s)]
*  was secure, all that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2871.7599999999998s)]
*  So yes. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2872.9199999999996s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2873.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2874.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a care about the community. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2875.9199999999996s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people, and I think especially right now, the way that you kind [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2876.9199999999996s)]
*  of build up a brand, it doesn't have to be a media brand. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2878.3599999999997s)]
*  It could be fucking toothpaste. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2880.4399999999996s)]
*  But it's like, hey, this is the toothpaste community. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2882.08s)]
*  Look at us. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2884.6s)]
*  We're the whitest teeth community. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2886.0s)]
*  We got this. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2887.0s)]
*  And the second you get that money, you never fucking talking about toothpaste again. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2888.0s)]
*  My brand, I've been, I don't want to say blessed, like the pizza fest, you name it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2891.4s)]
*  We have the best- [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2896.0s)]
*  You could say blessed on Yom Kippur. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2897.4s)]
*  Loyal on Yom Kippur. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2899.0s)]
*  Fans ever. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2901.04s)]
*  Like they have had, that's what lets us be us. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2902.04s)]
*  Like we've never been beholden in an advertisement or anything, because our people have been [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2904.8399999999997s)]
*  following us out 20 fucking years, a lot of them. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2907.96s)]
*  They always have it back. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2910.08s)]
*  They know who I am, they know who we are, and they'll go to war for us. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2911.08s)]
*  So that is part of what you're saying. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2913.88s)]
*  Just turn your back and be like, I'm fucking out on them. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2916.4s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2918.6600000000003s)]
*  And a lot of my employees have been with me 10, 15 fucking years. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2919.6600000000003s)]
*  They're friends, they're fucking a demented fucking family, and I don't like talking to [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2923.48s)]
*  them when I'm in the office because they drive me nuts, but they're still fucking family. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2928.1600000000003s)]
*  So that is why they go. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2932.6s)]
*  You feel the responsibility to take care of them. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2934.92s)]
*  Big time. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2936.48s)]
*  Now, if you found somebody, anybody that you thought, oh, this guy could take it over, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2937.48s)]
*  and these guys, everybody would still be taking care of Barstool being good hands. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2941.7599999999998s)]
*  You're fucking Harpy. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2944.2799999999997s)]
*  Is there somebody that, and we can bleep the name if you want. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2945.2799999999997s)]
*  We have internal people who could do it, but so Penn went with ESPN, that's what happened. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2950.14s)]
*  So when Penn was with- Penn is the gambling company. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2960.8999999999996s)]
*  They bought the gambling company who bought Barstool, and then they formed a 10 year, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2963.58s)]
*  like $2 billion deal with ESPN. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2968.84s)]
*  Like ESPN bets is gonna now be with Penn. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2970.88s)]
*  So once they did that, I'm looking at it's like, all right, ESPN and Penn now have this [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2973.92s)]
*  huge relationship. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2979.1400000000003s)]
*  We're far less important to Penn, and they're just gonna start the people aren't making [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2980.48s)]
*  big money or clear. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2985.04s)]
*  They were gonna keep both of them around? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2986.48s)]
*  I think they were, yeah, I don't know what their plan. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2989.92s)]
*  I think they would have streamlined the fuck out of Barstool. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2992.08s)]
*  I thought it was one or the other. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2994.88s)]
*  No, that's what I thought. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2996.32s)]
*  That's what I thought, you're leprechaunous. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2997.8s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=2999.8s)]
*  So then why did they sell it back to you for a dollar? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3000.8s)]
*  Because we have a great relationship with them. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3003.0s)]
*  So I think the situation was we're gonna really streamline Barstool. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3005.36s)]
*  It's gonna be about cut costs, get things go. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3012.04s)]
*  If you wanna go back and run it, because Barstool is losing money. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3014.52s)]
*  Like Barstool is losing 10 to 12 million bucks a year. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3017.96s)]
*  Which you can float when you have a massive billion dollar corporation that's pumping [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3020.8s)]
*  money into it. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  Once you have ESPN, it's like why are we losing 10 to 12 million dollars a year? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3025.9599999999996s)]
*  Let's fix that. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3029.4399999999996s)]
*  Or Dave, here, it's your thing. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3030.4399999999996s)]
*  You can do what you want. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3032.7999999999997s)]
*  We get that off the books. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3033.8399999999997s)]
*  And they're incentivized because if he sells it back, they get 50%. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3036.52s)]
*  So if they got the right guy in charge. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3039.24s)]
*  True, if you sell it again. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3040.24s)]
*  Yeah, if he sells it again. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3041.24s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3042.24s)]
*  Okay, so you're going in, you come into the business, and that's the thing a lot of people [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3043.24s)]
*  don't understand. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3046.64s)]
*  They just hear bought it back for a dollar, and then they go, well, this thing's printing [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3047.64s)]
*  money and he buys it back for a dollar. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3051.12s)]
*  They don't realize you're buying back, losing a million a month for a dollar. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3052.96s)]
*  So you're spending 12 million a year to buy it back. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3057.84s)]
*  Correct, pretty much. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3062.12s)]
*  I think that's something that's not reported enough. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3063.12s)]
*  So then you have the layoffs. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3064.8s)]
*  First of all, you just talk about these people as family. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3067.08s)]
*  Laying off is hard for you. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3070.7200000000003s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3071.7200000000003s)]
*  Now, I'm lucky in a sense, laying off anybody is hard. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3072.7200000000003s)]
*  Once we did the deal, a lot of people were brought into Barstool that I didn't know who [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3079.0s)]
*  they were. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3083.56s)]
*  And it was the process of making, Penn's a public company. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3084.56s)]
*  So books, finance, things I didn't associate with. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3087.44s)]
*  We had a layer that was really to make us function with a company that has to do public [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3090.96s)]
*  reports. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3095.96s)]
*  So you can see what was making money, what was in the money. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3096.96s)]
*  All of that. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3098.56s)]
*  But the content, the people I hired, the people I knew, almost all of them stayed. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3099.56s)]
*  So it sucks laying people off. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3104.32s)]
*  It's a lot harder when you know their faces, their family, their friends. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3107.6s)]
*  I didn't really know that. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3110.3199999999997s)]
*  We got rid of a lot of finance, business, people that were there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3111.68s)]
*  The company switched goals overnight, just overnight. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3117.24s)]
*  It went from Penn, build this huge pipeline, gambling, to a totally different company. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3121.36s)]
*  So a lot of people had to go. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3125.88s)]
*  Because they could be cool losing $12 million a year, as long as it was generating 20 and [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3127.44s)]
*  gambling. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3132.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a rounding error. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3133.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a rounding error. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3135.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to be in these fucking gambling institutions. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3136.92s)]
*  And I was there spending on advertising. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3137.92s)]
*  We were there marketing budgets. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3139.92s)]
*  So it's just a totally different way that you're running the business now. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3141.0800000000004s)]
*  So yeah, it still sucks. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3147.2000000000003s)]
*  Scary at all? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3148.84s)]
*  Going into it and going, okay, we need 12 million to get in the black. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3149.84s)]
*  Scary at all for you? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3154.96s)]
*  No. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3155.96s)]
*  I knew all the books. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3156.96s)]
*  I looked at it and I've made enough money. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3157.96s)]
*  So if I had to cover that myself for as long as I did, I was very comfortable doing that. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3159.44s)]
*  Got it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3163.5600000000004s)]
*  Like that wasn't. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3164.5600000000004s)]
*  And I didn't buy the company to make money. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3165.5600000000004s)]
*  I've said that a million times. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3167.36s)]
*  I've made my money. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3168.36s)]
*  Would I like to buy a sports team? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3169.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3170.36s)]
*  Am I ever going to be there? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3171.36s)]
*  No. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3172.36s)]
*  So it's like, what's the difference? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3173.36s)]
*  Wait, why not? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3174.36s)]
*  You need so much. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3175.36s)]
*  I don't want to be like a dick 1% owner. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3176.36s)]
*  I'm going to like to be like a bee. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3177.36s)]
*  The business isn't a bee business. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3180.6s)]
*  Unless there's an idea I haven't thought of yet. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3181.92s)]
*  So if you, okay, so if you get into the bees, the first purchase would be sports team. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3184.0s)]
*  That's the only thing I can ever imagine being like, fuck, that would be awesome. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3191.38s)]
*  What do you think that you could access? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3194.56s)]
*  Football is obviously almost impossible. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3196.44s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3198.04s)]
*  Hockey? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3199.04s)]
*  Yeah, I bet hockey is probably the most logical, my least of the favorite. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3200.04s)]
*  That's the tricky thing. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3203.44s)]
*  But I don't know what they think. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3204.44s)]
*  Like football, definitely not. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3206.6s)]
*  Baseball, I guess, no. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3207.96s)]
*  Basketball. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3210.0s)]
*  Basketball. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3211.0s)]
*  There's some young dudes like, you know, it's go whatever, but I am controversial. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3212.0s)]
*  They gotta get approved. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3215.96s)]
*  But I'm not even close to that. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3218.0s)]
*  But that's the only thing I think left in my life where it's like. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3219.14s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you own a fucking horse. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3224.0s)]
*  Multiple. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3226.56s)]
*  Just multiple. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3227.56s)]
*  Just a question about the way in which you went about the layoffs. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3228.56s)]
*  Would you have done it different? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3232.76s)]
*  Because I saw the clip of you coming into the office and just berating everybody, like, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3234.32s)]
*  where the fuck is everybody, and calling everybody. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3239.48s)]
*  Those all people stayed, yeah. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3242.32s)]
*  But then it's like you come to the office, you talk about the employees like that, and [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3244.04s)]
*  then all these layoffs happen, and it didn't look the best. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3248.6s)]
*  Well, A, you got it reversed, because the layoffs happened first. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3252.08s)]
*  So I was yelling at the people for not appreciating their jobs after all these layoffs, and everyone's [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3256.08s)]
*  late to work. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3260.4s)]
*  So you fire everybody, and then these people who. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3261.4s)]
*  No, but there were layoffs after that. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3263.4s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3264.4s)]
*  Most of them were before. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3265.4s)]
*  None at all? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3266.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3267.4s)]
*  Well, the layoffs, 90% of them happened like one day, right? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3268.4s)]
*  And then there was another wave of them? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3272.12s)]
*  No, there was one, there was like four people, and then I think all in one day, basically. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3274.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3279.7599999999998s)]
*  But would you have gone about it differently? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3280.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I don't know what you're asking. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3282.48s)]
*  Like, because you call them like, hey, this is my family, we're build a community, but [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3283.96s)]
*  then it's like you come in the office, it's like, fuck, where's everybody? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3288.2400000000002s)]
*  You guys are all lazy, fuck you, and then now you're fired. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3291.32s)]
*  But none of those lazy fired people, the people I was yelling at, none of them got fired. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3295.6800000000003s)]
*  So what. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3301.88s)]
*  You're talking about like I went into the content side when they didn't show up because [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3302.88s)]
*  we were going through layoffs, and it was more like how the fuck don't you show up, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3307.6400000000003s)]
*  and I'm pretty sure in the video, I'm like, after we just did fucking layoffs, you guys. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3312.28s)]
*  If there's one day to be early to work. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3315.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3317.48s)]
*  It's the day. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3318.48s)]
*  Got it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3319.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3320.48s)]
*  You show that you're grateful you still have your job. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3321.48s)]
*  Correct. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3323.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3324.0s)]
*  And no, no, I was on like the content. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3325.0s)]
*  So the way Barstool is essentially set up in New York, we have a second floor, which [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3326.16s)]
*  is almost all my content people, third floor is the business side. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3331.4s)]
*  That's really where, but like that was at like the people have been with me for 10 to [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3335.64s)]
*  15 years. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3340.28s)]
*  Which is like how I basically, when I was there a lot, talk to them anyways, but that, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3342.0400000000004s)]
*  even though it seems like you're saying you may know how the layoffs went at my own company [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3348.84s)]
*  better than me, I'm pretty sure that was after. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3352.52s)]
*  I'll just try to get clarity. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3356.52s)]
*  So this is an interesting thing also where it's like, if you got guys that are there [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3359.0800000000004s)]
*  for like 15 years, right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3362.84s)]
*  We all grew up with a certain energy in a business. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3364.32s)]
*  Like I like to yell. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3368.92s)]
*  I'm a huge yeller. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3370.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3371.56s)]
*  Let's see, I like to yell in front of people. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3372.56s)]
*  I don't need to like bring one person to a different room. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3373.88s)]
*  Same. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3376.84s)]
*  Everybody can hear it because we're all gonna hear it eventually. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3377.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3379.6800000000003s)]
*  So you might as well hear it from me. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3380.6800000000003s)]
*  And by the way, I let people yell back at me. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3381.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3382.6800000000003s)]
*  Let's go, let's dance. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3383.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3384.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3385.6800000000003s)]
*  I saw this like Jimmy Fallon shit. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3386.6800000000003s)]
*  Did you see? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3389.08s)]
*  Yeah, I did see it. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3390.08s)]
*  And the complaints about Fallon. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3391.08s)]
*  Yep. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3393.32s)]
*  That shit makes me very nervous. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3394.32s)]
*  And that made me kind of, now- [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3395.7200000000003s)]
*  Can you explain just for anybody? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3399.04s)]
*  Yeah, so Fallon basically, he, all his employees, or not all, a few, were like, it's a toxic [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3400.84s)]
*  place to work. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3406.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3407.72s)]
*  We don't like him. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3408.72s)]
*  He's unpredictable. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3409.72s)]
*  He yells. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3410.72s)]
*  He's nervous. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3411.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was a bunch of shit. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3412.72s)]
*  Which anybody now could say that about me if my employees want to do that. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3413.72s)]
*  Be like, my man, I remember we had a sales guy who fucking, I was at a Kentucky Derby [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3417.72s)]
*  and I was sitting next to a client. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3422.84s)]
*  The client was drunk, out of control. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3424.2s)]
*  I looked over to my sales guy and he's eating fucking shrimp cocktail. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3426.12s)]
*  The next day, I'm like, you fat fuck, you're eating fucking shrimp cocktail when I'm in [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3430.04s)]
*  the fucking weeds screaming at him. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3434.44s)]
*  I've had- [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3437.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3438.12s)]
*  Because you're babysitting this drunk clad. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3439.12s)]
*  We had, you won't talk about, we had, and this, you get canceled for this, but this [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3442.92s)]
*  is my personality, I don't mean, we had Biz Nasty, our hockey guy, he's awesome, spitting [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3447.32s)]
*  chicklets. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3455.2s)]
*  Biz brought in Chick-fil-A for the office one time. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3456.2s)]
*  Everyone lined up. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3459.2799999999997s)]
*  We ran out of Chick-fil-A. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3460.3199999999997s)]
*  He brought enough for the office. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3462.2s)]
*  I was like, who the fuck is taking double Chick-fil-As before everybody gets one? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3463.2s)]
*  I went up to the same sales guy who was a little bit on the bigger side. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3468.48s)]
*  I was going through his trash. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3471.2799999999997s)]
*  I was just sitting there through multiple wrappers. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3472.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, I know you took multiple. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3475.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't do that shit. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3477.6s)]
*  We had a fat pen at the office. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3479.24s)]
*  Fat people sat one area. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3481.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3483.12s)]
*  I'm like, I'm an old HBO. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3484.12s)]
*  I'm like, it's a fat pen. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3485.12s)]
*  You walk in, you throw like fucking Snickers bars in there. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3486.12s)]
*  But it's like a joke where people bust balls. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3489.96s)]
*  If I think somebody, and I know people may be like, you sound fucking awful, but- [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3493.24s)]
*  No, I don't think they will. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3496.72s)]
*  I think the average person is okay with this. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3497.72s)]
*  It's like, we bust balls and you do it back, and that's how our office is. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3498.72s)]
*  You take it, I've used this analogy, you'll get it. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3503.56s)]
*  I feel like a lot of times, barstool, people who don't like us, it's like going to a comedy [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3506.3199999999997s)]
*  show that you didn't buy a ticket for. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3513.3199999999997s)]
*  You don't like the comedian. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3515.3599999999997s)]
*  You hear a joke. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3516.7s)]
*  You walk out of the comedy show and you'll be like, you'll never believe what this guy [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3517.7s)]
*  said, and you give no context to any of it. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3521.52s)]
*  That is how I feel a lot of the shit we deal with is that. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3524.6s)]
*  And I think that's way more now because we're being pushed content we never asked for. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3528.7799999999997s)]
*  Whereas back in the day, you had to turn on HBO to watch the HBO show. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3533.88s)]
*  Now you're just on your phone. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3537.92s)]
*  You swipe up another TikTok, and then you're talking shit to some employee with no context [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3539.18s)]
*  and they're like, who the fuck is this guy calling all the fat people to go to the fat [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3543.12s)]
*  pen, right? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3546.12s)]
*  So I understand that knee-jerk reaction a little bit more from people because they're [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3547.12s)]
*  not opting in as much. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3551.64s)]
*  That being said, when you see an article written about the Fallon situation, for me, that's [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3553.44s)]
*  what we were talking about earlier. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3557.84s)]
*  It's just like, okay, I can get clicks from famous person being toxic at work. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3558.84s)]
*  Let me describe it and nobody will read the fucking article. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3563.36s)]
*  They'll read one paragraph because once we described what it was on here, and granted, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3566.36s)]
*  but there wasn't a single one of us who was like, this is inappropriate. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3571.96s)]
*  Dude, and I tried to read headlines and I remember, I mean, I tried to read articles, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3574.36s)]
*  not just headlines, and I remember on that one, I was like, fuck, I just read the headline. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3578.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3581.4s)]
*  I did a disservice to Jimmy. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3582.4s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3583.4s)]
*  It's time to learn a second language, okay? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3585.0800000000004s)]
*  It's time to put the time in to learn a second language. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3587.1200000000003s)]
*  If you only speak English, learn some Spanish, learn some French, learn some Arabic, learn [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3591.0800000000004s)]
*  some Mandarin shit, the way things are going, that might help you. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3594.96s)]
*  My point is, is that Babel has got your back. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3598.38s)]
*  It is the best way to learn a language and I promise you, well, the number one best way [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3601.46s)]
*  is through immersion, okay? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3606.02s)]
*  That is the number one way. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3607.26s)]
*  But if you cannot afford to just go live in another country for a year, then what you [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3608.6200000000003s)]
*  gotta do is use Babel. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3612.1000000000004s)]
*  With Babel, you can start speaking a new language in just three weeks. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3614.2200000000003s)]
*  Think about that right now, okay? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3617.02s)]
*  It works. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3618.78s)]
*  Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a private tutor, fooling yourself with these [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3619.78s)]
*  language apps that are a little more than games, Babel's quick 10-minute lessons are [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3622.34s)]
*  designed by language experts to help you start speaking a new language in as little as three [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3626.5s)]
*  weeks. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3630.26s)]
*  Babel is for real conversations. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3631.26s)]
*  All Babel tools are approachable, rooted in real life situations and delivered with conversation-based [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3632.26s)]
*  teaching. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3637.1800000000003s)]
*  I could use it too, because I can speak Hindi, but my accent is very white. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3638.1800000000003s)]
*  I hate to admit it. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3641.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3642.42s)]
*  It hurts me to say it, but it's white. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3643.42s)]
*  This could maybe help me. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3644.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3645.42s)]

*  I have. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3739.3799999999997s)]
*  It's an interesting one for me because of my past. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3740.3799999999997s)]
*  The business side or whenever something like this happens. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3744.06s)]
*  You have to be skeptical, right? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3746.9399999999996s)]
*  People rush me, support him, do this, do that. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3748.06s)]
*  It's like, I don't know what the fuck he did. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3750.2999999999997s)]
*  How does anyone know? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3752.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure people say that about me. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3753.2599999999998s)]
*  The only thing I know is what I fucking did, which was nothing. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3754.9399999999996s)]
*  But last thing I wanna do is rush to the forefront of a guy and then two weeks later, there's [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3757.8199999999997s)]

*  So you don't have to jump and say he's innocent just because of what you went through. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3765.26s)]
*  You gotta let the facts come out. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3770.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, but you also don't have to jump and say he's guilty. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3771.2200000000003s)]
*  Right, yeah, I've said right. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3772.5400000000004s)]
*  You gotta let it play out. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3773.5400000000004s)]
*  It's wild to see what's happening. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3775.5s)]
*  And you know what's interesting is like seeing, I've seen a lot of stuff from the British [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3776.5s)]
*  comedy scene kind of come out and they have not been very supportive. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3781.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so you never know. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3785.42s)]
*  And I can only look at like when my business side or stuff came out, within 24 hours, I [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3786.98s)]
*  had, and it's still up. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3792.3s)]
*  What I would maintain is a mountain of evidence that totally dispelled the article, improved [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3794.22s)]
*  everything I said was right. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3801.46s)]
*  It's all up there, text messages, everything. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3802.94s)]
*  People should have that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3807.46s)]
*  I feel like- [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3808.46s)]
*  You got, let's go. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3809.46s)]
*  Yeah, like, all right, you wanna do it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3810.94s)]
*  And that's what I scream, like here it is. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3812.3799999999997s)]
*  I have text messages with a girl for like five years after the fact of her being like, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3814.66s)]
*  let's hang out, let's do, only I publish that. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3820.14s)]
*  You wanna see the evidence, but you have to let it play out. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3824.1s)]
*  You can't, so when I see Russell Brand, I don't think, I have no idea. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3826.66s)]
*  It's like, hopefully, I always find it crazy. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3831.7s)]
*  People will fucking root for him to be guilty. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3836.3399999999997s)]
*  And it's like- [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3838.46s)]
*  Why would you want these girls to have gone through that? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3839.46s)]
*  What you don't want, the number one goal here is the girls didn't go through. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3842.58s)]
*  100%. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3845.8599999999997s)]
*  So that's what you should be rooting for. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3846.8599999999997s)]
*  But it seems like either there's- [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3848.06s)]
*  I know with me, it felt like the people in Enlightenment were rooting for the accusations [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3849.62s)]
*  being true. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3853.42s)]
*  So they would rather a girl get assaulted just so you go down. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3854.42s)]
*  Yes, it's crazy. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3858.78s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3859.78s)]
*  They're lying and then girls weren't assaulted. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3860.78s)]
*  You wanna talk about toxic or twisted shit, that is a wild mentality. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3862.58s)]
*  You were willing to sacrifice four women to get you? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3867.34s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3871.1400000000003s)]
*  Three was what the accusation was. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3872.1400000000003s)]
*  Three, whatever. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3873.1400000000003s)]
*  By the way- [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3874.1400000000003s)]
*  Four for Russell. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3875.1400000000003s)]
*  We'll clarify right now. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3876.1400000000003s)]
*  The first one, the one that started the day after the things launch was put in contact [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3877.14s)]
*  by Sophie Franklin and Milf Hunter, who hate my guts. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3880.18s)]
*  And by the way, on a live fucking her personal friends, Instagram live story the entire weekend. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3883.8199999999997s)]
*  She's saying all these things happen. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3890.3399999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, she's in real time saying I'm the most boring fucking guy in the world. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3891.7s)]
*  She hates my guts. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3895.9s)]
*  She'll only hook up with athletes. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3896.9s)]
*  The other one, I have text messaged five. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3899.1s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3900.8199999999997s)]
*  I always have to say it because there's no way to stop it. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3901.8199999999997s)]
*  The thing that's frustrating, whether it's Russell Brand or anybody- [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3904.7000000000003s)]
*  I feel like you got the best out of that situation. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3906.9s)]
*  If you're telling the truth, you can't even sum it up quickly. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3907.9s)]
*  People retweet the articles and they go with the headline. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3912.1400000000003s)]
*  I always reference your situation, especially when it comes to like Louis, right? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3914.46s)]
*  Louis didn't go out and on the attack. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3921.1400000000003s)]
*  He kind of let the idea of what he did crystallize in casual fans, so they didn't really know [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3925.82s)]
*  what happened. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3932.2000000000003s)]
*  If he had gone out immediately and was like, hey, here's exactly what happened. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3934.1s)]
*  You tell me if I did anything wrong here. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3937.54s)]
*  I asked permission. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3939.7799999999997s)]
*  It's some weird shit. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3940.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's some weird shit, but I asked every single one, tell me if you did [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3941.7799999999997s)]
*  anything wrong. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3944.7799999999997s)]
*  I guarantee it would have changed his perception. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3945.7799999999997s)]
*  Now he's back. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3947.22s)]
*  He's killing it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3948.22s)]
*  But it's a perfect example of like, if they're coming for your life, you got to fight for [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3949.22s)]
*  your life if you're innocent, man. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3952.22s)]
*  You can't just sit fucking back. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3953.22s)]
*  I always wonder like it's, I saw a quote just even yesterday where someone said we supported [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3955.3799999999997s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3964.8599999999997s)]
*  We had a Barstool radio that day when all that shit broke and we prefaced it by saying [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3968.8599999999997s)]
*  he's a monster. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3972.98s)]
*  This isn't his case. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3973.98s)]
*  He deserves to rot in prison. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3975.02s)]
*  That was the beginning. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3976.3599999999997s)]
*  And we're saying- [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3977.3599999999997s)]
*  But he made some good movies. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3978.3599999999997s)]
*  We said theoretically- [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3980.56s)]
*  Yeah, he had some good hits. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3981.56s)]
*  The conversation was- [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3984.66s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3986.38s)]
*  Shakespeare in love? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3987.38s)]
*  I'm not even going to- [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3988.38s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3989.38s)]
*  God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3990.38s)]
*  I had a great point. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3995.38s)]
*  You're never gonna hear it again. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=3998.38s)]
*  That point's gone. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4000.38s)]
*  We can get it out of my pick. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4001.38s)]
*  I think we can tickle it out of him. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4005.38s)]
*  Come on, tell me, what was it? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4008.38s)]
*  What was it? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4009.38s)]
*  It's gone. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4010.38s)]
*  Once I'm on a point and it doesn't come out, it's gone. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4011.82s)]
*  You're acting like a real mishuganist. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4014.82s)]
*  No, it's gone. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4017.82s)]
*  It's gone. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4020.82s)]
*  What's up? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4021.82s)]
*  This is a fun game. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4022.82s)]
*  You're great at handling controversy. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4025.82s)]
*  Let's think of people that are going through controversy, whether it's like big stakes [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4027.82s)]
*  or small stakes. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4031.34s)]
*  How would you deal with it? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4032.34s)]
*  Logan Paul, Dylan Danis, coming at him, coming at his ex. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4033.34s)]
*  What's your advice? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4036.46s)]
*  What's your MDH thing? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4037.46s)]
*  Listen, I like Logan and I know Dylan. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4039.54s)]
*  I think you signed a deal with the devil when you're fighting Dylan Danis. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4044.54s)]
*  Dylan Danis is a savage. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4048.54s)]
*  Now, do you know he's gonna go that hard on Nina Agel? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4050.54s)]
*  No, but it's the fight game. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4053.54s)]
*  I think you just let... [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4055.54s)]
*  I saw the video where she's like, she likes sex. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4056.54s)]
*  I don't know how he got that, probably illegally. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4061.54s)]
*  But he's photoshopping her on pictures, so who fucking cares to a degree? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4063.54s)]
*  But that's Dylan Danis. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4068.62s)]
*  I just ignore it. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4069.62s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4070.62s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to say because it's not Logan. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4071.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4074.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4075.62s)]
*  It's like he's, I'm sure... [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4076.62s)]
*  If someone's going after my girlfriend like that, it would be hell on earth for me. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4077.62s)]
*  I don't think Logan probably... [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4080.62s)]
*  He's just managing his fiance, which he should and has to, but it is the fight game. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4082.62s)]
*  The fight game's like a wild world where it's like the wild, wild west. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4087.62s)]
*  So if you were Logan, you would ignore all the comments? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4091.62s)]
*  I would do like the NDA shit and things like that or suing or whatever like Nina sued him. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4095.7s)]
*  It's part of the fight game, just be like, I'm going to beat the fuck out of you. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4100.7s)]
*  I still don't think that fight's going to happen. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4104.7s)]
*  So that's the tricky thing. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4106.7s)]
*  Is it weirdly, do the lawsuits give Dylan a way out? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4108.9s)]
*  I mean, the guy hasn't fought in like 10 years, and he didn't look great. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4113.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4119.9s)]
*  It is interesting. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4120.9s)]
*  I guess they're suing because one of the pictures or videos was private. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4122.7s)]
*  Well, that's the one I was talking about where Nina... [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4126.7s)]
*  Oh, it was her talking. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4128.7s)]
*  I thought she just put that on Instagram or sort of Snapchat. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4130.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I think she said that must have been taken deep from her archives. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4132.66s)]
*  But why would she record into her phone speaking publicly? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4136.86s)]
*  Maybe she was like... [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4142.66s)]
*  It could have been sent to somebody. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4143.66s)]
*  Got you. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4144.66s)]
*  Her friends. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4145.66s)]
*  It's a group chat. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4146.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4147.66s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4148.66s)]
*  Okay, so that's a private thing. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4149.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4150.66s)]
*  Okay, I get that. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4152.66s)]
*  That being said, if he wasn't posting every single day, I don't think that there's a lawsuit [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4153.66s)]
*  out there. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4161.9s)]
*  I think they're focusing on that specific video, but it's not about that video. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4162.9s)]
*  It's about the onslaught of images, it's painting her. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4167.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, again, to me, I saw Logan say this at one point. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4169.66s)]
*  He was like, yeah, she had boyfriends before me. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4175.38s)]
*  I haven't seen anything too fucking great. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4178.22s)]
*  She had boyfriends. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4179.78s)]
*  Yeah, she's a beautiful woman who's dated successful dudes. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4180.9s)]
*  Once Nina shows that she's upset by it, listen, Dennis will go in. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4185.0599999999995s)]
*  There's nothing to stop him. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4189.46s)]
*  So anytime you acknowledge, engage, do more, he just ramps it up. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4191.259999999999s)]
*  It's the fight game. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4195.66s)]
*  I asked Dylan about it, and he's like, any image that's being shared is public. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4196.66s)]
*  It's either been shared by her or she's like, now he's creating the narrative behind it. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4202.3s)]
*  And then we could argue how bad it is to bully this girl, which is bad. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4207.26s)]
*  She's not involved, right? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4212.58s)]
*  It is the fight game, but I think there's also an ickiness we all feel. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4214.06s)]
*  We're like- [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4217.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's family. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4218.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's like- [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4219.06s)]
*  Family out. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4220.06s)]
*  Yeah, like, what's going on here? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4221.06s)]
*  I wouldn't want anybody talking about my wife like that. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4222.06s)]
*  Totally. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4223.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4224.06s)]
*  But I'm trying to think- [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4225.06s)]
*  But I do think not that Logan would have expected this. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4226.06s)]
*  But he had to expect- [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4230.38s)]
*  It is not remotely surprising that Dylan would go here. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4232.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4234.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's been trolling nonstop. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4236.54s)]
*  So what happens if that fight, if he doesn't show up to the fight? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4239.58s)]
*  I think he'll continue with the trolling, probably. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4244.5s)]
*  What happens if he wins? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4246.82s)]
*  We're all in trouble. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4249.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4250.78s)]
*  It'll be never ending. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4251.78s)]
*  I don't think he will, but it'll be never ending. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4252.78s)]
*  Are you gonna go? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4255.06s)]
*  No. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4256.06s)]
*  I've lost my interest in, to Dylan's, if you want to say credit, he has made it interesting. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4257.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4263.34s)]
*  You know there's real fucking bad blood. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4265.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4266.78s)]
*  But I've kind of lost my interest on the celebrity boxing shit. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4267.78s)]
*  You're over it. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4270.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4271.9800000000005s)]
*  I thought that would be a perfect lane for Barstool. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4272.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4274.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's been a habit. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4275.860000000001s)]
*  You guys have been doing- [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4276.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we do like, but not name. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4277.9400000000005s)]
*  We do like no names. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4279.38s)]
*  Yeah, celebrity ones. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4280.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4283.860000000001s)]
*  The Jake Paul fury fight was my last kind of, because I didn't know how good Jake was. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4285.1s)]
*  I was very curious. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4290.66s)]
*  And then when he fought Fury, I think I came to the conclusion, like he beat the shit out [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4292.02s)]
*  of me, but he's certainly not an elite boxer. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4296.14s)]
*  And that kind of took the bloom off the rose for me a little bit. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4298.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder, the celebrity boxing thing, and you guys kind of picked up on this because [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4304.22s)]
*  you wouldn't do for the, was it Ruffin' Rowdy? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4308.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you wouldn't do celebrities, but you would do like archetypes, like Hillbilly. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4311.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4316.26s)]
*  We had Gonzago. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4317.540000000001s)]
*  We had Jose Gonzago. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4318.540000000001s)]
*  Private school kid. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4319.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you had Jose. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4320.540000000001s)]
*  I also think it's a really interesting way of like galvanizing group support, because [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4322.06s)]
*  this is what boxing was, right? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4326.58s)]
*  Totally. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4327.58s)]
*  When we were growing up, it was just like Mexican versus American. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4328.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4330.58s)]
*  Puerto Rican versus black guy. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4331.58s)]
*  That's still a huge thing with boxing. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4332.58s)]
*  It wins every fucking time, because you tap into that identity. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4333.58s)]
*  So if you got like, I'm from the Appalachian Mountains guy, and then you got city private [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4336.58s)]
*  school kid, I mean this is- [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4340.5s)]
*  And we still do celebrities. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4342.3s)]
*  The thing is, celebrities, just like anything, with social media, they don't need the middleman. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4343.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4347.0199999999995s)]
*  They can make all the money themselves. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4348.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4349.0199999999995s)]
*  Like what do they want to give us? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4350.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, certainly Logan and Dylan don't need us to help promote their fucking, everyone [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4351.5s)]
*  knows about this fight. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4355.14s)]
*  When is it? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4356.14s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4357.14s)]
*  It's gotta be coming out. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4358.14s)]
*  It's on October 14th? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4359.14s)]
*  Is it 14th? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4360.14s)]
*  I think 14th. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4361.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4362.14s)]
*  13th, 15th, one of those. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4363.14s)]
*  Are you a UFC guy at all? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4364.14s)]
*  Moderate. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4366.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4367.14s)]
*  Like big fights. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4368.14s)]
*  We sponsored Patty the Batty, Molly Meatball. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4369.14s)]
*  I'll go to the big ones, but I'm more of a boxing guy, traditional boxing. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4370.620000000001s)]
*  What is- [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4374.620000000001s)]
*  I saw you, I think, at a UFC fight. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4375.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we saw, yeah. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4376.620000000001s)]
*  It was at the Garden. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4377.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4378.620000000001s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4379.620000000001s)]
*  You said something interesting out there. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4381.22s)]
*  You said, my only joy in life right now is eating. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4382.62s)]
*  That's true. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4386.0199999999995s)]
*  Because I asked you, I was like, would you do a Zempik? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4387.0199999999995s)]
*  And you were like, yeah, but you can't eat. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4388.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's the only thing I have to look forward to. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4389.98s)]
*  That's factual. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4392.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4393.22s)]
*  Is that because you've made the money, you have the houses, your family's safe? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4394.22s)]
*  And this is, like explain that to me. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4398.38s)]
*  Like, is it because you have the things that you want? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4401.18s)]
*  I think as you get older, I'm in a committed relationship, so I'm not chasing girls or [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4403.099999999999s)]
*  doing anything like that. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4408.0199999999995s)]
*  I like gambling, but food, it's like, I feel like when you're younger, you're going out, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4409.46s)]
*  you're partying, you're doing other stuff. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4413.7s)]
*  I just eat. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4416.9400000000005s)]
*  This is the drug now. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4417.9400000000005s)]

*  It's like, well, I fucking hate Times Square. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4731.34s)]
*  It's Times Square, but they're all Japanese. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4733.18s)]
*  And it's like the best places, like, hey, Dave Ford wants a reservation. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4735.82s)]
*  I'm like, who the fuck are you like? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4740.78s)]

*  You go through the hotels. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4743.3s)]
*  The hotels take care of everything. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4745.5s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4746.9800000000005s)]

*  Just you- [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4751.34s)]
*  It's like they wanted the restaurant to be like the M&M store. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4752.42s)]
*  Imagine if the best restaurants were in Times Square. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4754.54s)]
*  Still wouldn't fucking hate it. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4756.7s)]
*  And the restaurants wouldn't even be in that area. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4758.1s)]
*  I don't like people, there's too many, I don't like crowds. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4759.860000000001s)]

*  Because I'm taller? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4767.74s)]
*  No, they look that different. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4768.74s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't see color. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4769.74s)]
*  I didn't even get to joke. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4770.74s)]
*  Some people say they look similar. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4774.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't know what you guys are talking about. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4775.26s)]
*  Okay, this needs to happen. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4780.46s)]
*  And Dave goes to Tokyo and they just opened up cuz they were closed for years because [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4782.3s)]
*  of COVID. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4787.34s)]
*  So you couldn't even travel there. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4788.34s)]
*  I didn't know that because I wasn't looking to go. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4789.34s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4791.42s)]
*  They just opened up? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4792.42s)]
*  I think within a few months. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4793.42s)]
*  That's why it seems like all these celebs have been gone. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4794.42s)]
*  This is- [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4796.24s)]

*  Kai Sinat and Speed. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4804.24s)]
*  I don't even know who the fuck they are. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4805.24s)]
*  They're streamers. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4808.820000000001s)]
*  They stream on Twitch. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4809.820000000001s)]
*  You know Kai is the guy who did that thing in Times Square and like- [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4810.94s)]
*  The riot. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4813.339999999999s)]

*  Are you into the streaming thing at all? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4816.339999999999s)]
*  What is your, you don't think- [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4817.82s)]
*  I mean, they're obviously, I get that they're fucking hugely impactful, influential, but [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4818.82s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4824.379999999999s)]
*  Streaming's not, I missed that wave. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4825.379999999999s)]
*  Do you have your eye on any like talent out there that you're trying to bring to the [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4828.339999999999s)]
*  bar still? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4831.94s)]
*  No, not really. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4832.94s)]
*  You guys pick- [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4833.94s)]
*  We have great, we've had great talent, still have great talent, come through the doors. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4834.94s)]
*  We're always looking. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4838.86s)]
*  What do you look for in talent? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4839.86s)]
*  Because you have a great eye for talent. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4841.7s)]
*  You're like the SNL for the online world almost. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4843.339999999999s)]
*  It's just different really. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4845.82s)]
*  Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4847.339999999999s)]
*  Like Call Her Daddy, I didn't really fucking get it, but it's like I knew it was different. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4848.86s)]
*  Million Dollars Are Worth a Game, I thought they were very fucking funny. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4852.94s)]
*  So it just varies, like Rome, different. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4856.58s)]
*  I was hoping that the camera on Mace Show, I was hoping that- [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4859.58s)]
*  We talked to them. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4862.66s)]
*  Oh, is that going to happen? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4863.66s)]
*  No, I don't think we're- [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4864.66s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4865.66s)]
*  Fantastic, dude. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4866.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4867.66s)]
*  That would have been a perfect fit. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4869.46s)]
*  You made an offer to them? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4870.46s)]
*  I don't know if we ever went that far. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4871.46s)]
*  It was also at a time when I wasn't the owner of the company anymore. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4873.0199999999995s)]
*  So they weren't cheap. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4879.58s)]
*  So it was like, we talked to them and ultimately I think it was a pen decision. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4880.86s)]
*  I believe we got a quote, I won't say what it was. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4888.54s)]
*  It was a lot, we gave it a lot of thought and we just passed, it was really a pen thing. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4891.22s)]
*  God damn. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4895.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably big money, but they got it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4896.74s)]
*  They got it a lot. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4899.0599999999995s)]
*  If you were at the helm, would you have- [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4900.54s)]
*  I don't know, because generally they already were too big for when we like to get involved. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4902.54s)]
*  Because if someone's already exploded, what's our value add? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4913.62s)]
*  Anybody can write you a check, but we like to be kind of on the come up. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4917.58s)]
*  So like Call Her Daddy was nothing. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4921.94s)]
*  The Mildredals-Worth game was already big, but they had it, I don't think hit that next [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4923.66s)]
*  level again. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4928.5s)]
*  You're sharing the growth. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4929.5s)]
*  Yeah, because that's our value. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4930.5s)]
*  If anybody can write a check. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4932.46s)]
*  They were already, I feel like, before we got involved. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4935.82s)]
*  I mean, we had fucking Dion. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4939.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4942.22s)]
*  Dude, that, okay. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4943.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4944.22s)]
*  Did you watch- [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4945.22s)]
*  We had Dion like right before he went to Colorado. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4946.22s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4948.099999999999s)]
*  He's the best guy in the world. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4949.099999999999s)]
*  Ever. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4951.0199999999995s)]
*  Love him. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4952.0199999999995s)]
*  He's the number one guy I've met that was totally different than what I thought I was [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4953.02s)]
*  getting when I met him. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4957.26s)]
*  And just like the smartest down to earth aware, like calculating, just do whatever. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4958.46s)]
*  First time you met him, what happens? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4966.900000000001s)]
*  I was impressed instantly. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4968.34s)]
*  Like, we just started talking, shooting the shit. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4969.34s)]
*  First of all, some athletes have- [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4971.3s)]
*  In person or phone call? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4972.3s)]
*  Can you paint the picture for us? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4973.3s)]
*  So, well, some athletes at his stature or whatever have an air about him, where it's [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4974.700000000001s)]
*  not sure you can bust balls. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4980.5s)]
*  He could take it. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4983.9s)]
*  You can say anything, make fun of him for anything. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4984.9s)]
*  He'd give it back to you, just so down to earth. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4986.66s)]
*  And then the story that got me was he was talking about his prime time character. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4989.1s)]
*  And he's like, well, when I was in college, I looked at all the people who gained drafted [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4993.18s)]
*  and money slots, quarterbacks and all this. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=4998.62s)]
*  He's like, no defensive act ever made money, ever got paid. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5001.26s)]
*  So I'm like, what do I do to change this? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5004.26s)]
*  Invent prime time, make myself- [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5006.86s)]
*  Conscious decision. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5008.46s)]
*  Genius. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5009.46s)]
*  Create this fucking marketing thing and it fucking worked. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5010.46s)]
*  And he's dead right. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5013.78s)]
*  Everything he does is calculated, smart, just he's, and he's so wildly humble, which you [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5014.9800000000005s)]
*  wouldn't expect. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5023.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5024.54s)]
*  And the way, you can bust the balls. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5025.54s)]
*  If he loses, I could text him and be like, you fucked that play call. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5028.1s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I know. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5030.66s)]
*  He's just, he comes across as one of the guys, truly. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5031.9800000000005s)]
*  He's had my back through, if someone attacks, ask, he's like, I love him. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5036.7s)]
*  He's straight. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5041.34s)]
*  He's honestly, I can't root for him. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5042.34s)]
*  And I knew he would be successful. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5044.5s)]
*  I knew that within, and when I say that as a college coach, anybody who could sit with [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5046.0599999999995s)]
*  him and not hire him is a moron. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5050.7s)]
*  He's perfect for this age. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5053.78s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5055.099999999999s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5056.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's got insane gravity. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5057.099999999999s)]
*  There are some people that for whatever reason, when they talk, the world wants to know what [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5058.78s)]
*  they're saying, whatever they're doing, the eyeballs are on him and he's one of them. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5062.7s)]
*  Obviously, this past weekend, difficult. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5066.34s)]
*  Did you expect this? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5068.860000000001s)]
*  It didn't shock me. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5070.18s)]
*  I thought they had a chance to win, if we're being honest. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5072.18s)]
*  But they lost Travis Hunter and he just doesn't have the guys yet. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5075.06s)]
*  But it didn't shock me. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5079.38s)]
*  Do you think that, because we all love to root for the cocky, the bravado. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5080.38s)]
*  Everybody loves when Connor was knocking people out and being confident. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5088.22s)]
*  And the second he stumbles, everybody kind of. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5091.02s)]
*  So do you think that's going to happen this week with Deion? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5094.74s)]
*  Oh, it was all a high job. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5097.179999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5098.66s)]
*  It wasn't real. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5099.66s)]
*  Listen, that will come. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5100.66s)]
*  But I guess what I'm saying about Deion, and I think he's smart enough if he's like, you [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5102.34s)]
*  know what? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5106.7s)]
*  Me being humble and almost deferential to other teams or whatever would help me win, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5107.7s)]
*  he'd do that. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5115.94s)]
*  He's doing what he thinks he has to do to build the best program. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5116.94s)]
*  Everything counts. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5120.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5121.82s)]
*  And it's working. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5122.82s)]
*  People are going to forget that. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5123.9s)]
*  Colorado is horrible. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5125.099999999999s)]
*  They didn't expect them to be 0-3 going into that game. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5126.099999999999s)]
*  He's already been a success no matter what happens. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5129.42s)]
*  They were like the worst team ever last year. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5131.62s)]
*  I'm a college football casual, but the only college football memory I have of Colorado [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5133.42s)]
*  before this year was at Cordell Stewart Hail Mary in like 94. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5137.38s)]
*  That's all I got in 20 years, 30 years, whatever it's been. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5141.98s)]
*  That's it. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5146.219999999999s)]
*  And even look what he does. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5147.219999999999s)]
*  You can tell a lot by the people who come back to support him, whether it be Troy Aikman [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5149.42s)]
*  one week and then it'll be Michael Irvin the next. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5156.22s)]
*  And it's like you don't find people who know him who say bad things. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5158.62s)]
*  The people he spent a lot of time around are all uniform. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5163.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's fucking the real deal. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5166.54s)]
*  Do you remember watching him play? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5168.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5170.82s)]
*  Have you seen anything like it since? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5172.3s)]
*  No, he was a different guy. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5174.9400000000005s)]
*  It's weird because I actually was more like Bo Jackson. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5178.62s)]
*  Like Bo Jackson until he got hurt. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5183.18s)]
*  I was like, I would be more like Deion Cant hold Bo Jackson, jockstrap type guy as a kid. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5185.22s)]
*  I thought Bo was- [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5189.94s)]
*  Because the two- [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5190.94s)]
*  Bo was also that, dude. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5191.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5192.94s)]
*  And then you saw Bo play offense too, which is way more exciting. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5193.94s)]
*  Bo, like husband trophy. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5197.7s)]
*  And to be that muscular and run like that. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5198.7s)]
*  He was like the superhero. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5200.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was unreal. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5201.7s)]
*  Yeah, so for me, now you look back, but for me it's like who is the original two-spin [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5202.7s)]
*  two-sport athlete? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5208.5s)]
*  The Bo knows campaign, all that. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5209.5s)]
*  It was fucking Bo Jackson. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5210.94s)]
*  Even the stories you'd hear about him are like, I watched that 30 for 30 on him. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5212.94s)]
*  Insane. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5217.66s)]
*  What story? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5218.66s)]
*  Just there was a million of them, like these crazy hero. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5219.66s)]
*  Like you just pick a baseball up and like throw it out of a field. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5221.94s)]
*  There's that clip of him in the Royals game. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5225.02s)]
*  He runs on the wall. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5226.82s)]
*  Yeah, runs up the wall. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5227.82s)]
*  Runs sideways. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5228.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5229.82s)]
*  But I remember him. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5233.74s)]
*  I remembered him more. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5234.98s)]
*  My memory of Dion was like very flamboyant, like flashy, kind of like talk a lot player. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5236.0599999999995s)]
*  I didn't really know the person as much. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5243.219999999999s)]
*  And I was probably on the young side. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5244.98s)]
*  My roommate said it well, and this was like 15 years ago, but he said every cornerback [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5247.099999999999s)]
*  you've seen since Dion is just doing Dion in some form or fashion. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5250.5s)]
*  They got the long towel hanging out the back. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5254.94s)]
*  For a while they would wear that little headband around the neck that Dion would wear. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5256.9s)]
*  They're all just doing Dion. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5260.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5261.58s)]
*  Obviously you're going to replicate the most successful person in your position, but it's [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5262.58s)]
*  just crazy that somebody who is playing defense could be the star of the team. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5266.3s)]
*  I understand maybe a linebacker because you're sacking the quarterback. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5271.82s)]
*  There's like this terror, but the better corner you are, the less active you'll be in the [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5274.78s)]
*  game. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5279.7s)]
*  Totally. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5280.7s)]
*  And somehow we're still watching him. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5281.7s)]
*  He did the punt returns, the dances, the videos, everything. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5282.7s)]
*  I remember being, I grew up in Dallas. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5285.74s)]
*  I was a cowboy fan. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5287.7s)]
*  to return a punt. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5289.84s)]
*  Just so you could fit home, the whole family, this is it. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5290.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5293.56s)]
*  There's that great moment when I think he's playing for the 49ers and they're playing [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5294.56s)]
*  the Atlanta Hawks. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5300.12s)]
*  It's the first time back in Atlanta, sorry, sorry, the Atlanta Falcons. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5301.12s)]
*  It's the first time back in Atlanta and he gets a pick six. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5303.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5307.4400000000005s)]
*  And after the game he goes, he says the truth, he goes, this is always my home. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5308.4400000000005s)]
*  Even if I'm not playing for this team, it's my home. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5312.56s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5315.08s)]
*  It's like, what a fucking legend. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5316.08s)]
*  To do the post, you could go after that, be like, I was so emotional to be here. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5317.84s)]
*  No, no, keep the character on. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5322.0s)]
*  No, I'm a huge fan. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5323.24s)]
*  I'll be a huge fan of his for life. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5325.24s)]
*  Till your cornerbacks get not getting paid story, now it's like one of the top five positions [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5326.96s)]
*  to play in football. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5330.360000000001s)]
*  And you didn't even think about that until you said it. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5331.92s)]
*  That's all back to Deon. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5333.92s)]
*  Yeah, and he got branding early. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5334.92s)]
*  He's like, how do I make money? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5336.84s)]
*  How do I get contracts sponsored? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5339.8s)]
*  He got it. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5342.32s)]
*  He got it. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5343.32s)]
*  Smart. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5344.32s)]
*  He had a shoe that was fire. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5345.32s)]
*  Football players never have cool shoes. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5346.32s)]
*  Too legit to quit. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5347.799999999999s)]
*  MNMC Hammer, right? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5348.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, using the Brad videos. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5349.799999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5350.799999999999s)]
*  All right, on that sports talk, it's time to lock in our entries this week with prize [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5351.799999999999s)]
*  picks, okay? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5356.799999999999s)]
*  Akash, how'd you do last week with the Akash locks? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5357.799999999999s)]
*  I got lost. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5359.92s)]
*  The locks might be just pick the opposite of what I'm saying. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5360.92s)]
*  But still pick that. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5362.84s)]
*  That's a good strategy. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5363.84s)]
*  That's a good strategy. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5364.84s)]
*  I think so. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5365.84s)]
*  Okay, so we're going against whatever Akash is picking. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5366.84s)]
*  We got the more or less, give it to me. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5369.08s)]
*  Travis Kelcey. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5371.599999999999s)]
*  More than half a touchdown, that means he'll get at least one touchdown. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5374.16s)]
*  Taylor Swift is there. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5377.2s)]
*  That's the Taylor Swift effect. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5378.36s)]
*  That's the Sweezy effect. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5379.36s)]
*  I'm going to go more than half a touchdown for Travis Kelcey. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5380.36s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5382.639999999999s)]
*  You could also argue that he might be too distracted and caught up with all the drama [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5383.639999999999s)]
*  with Taylor Swift. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5386.24s)]
*  Weaken the legs. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5387.24s)]
*  Weaken the legs. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5388.24s)]
*  So maybe he isn't. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5389.24s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to go less. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5390.24s)]
*  I'm going to go opposite on Akash on every single one go. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5391.24s)]
*  Okay, Justin Jefferson, more or less than half a touchdown. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5392.92s)]
*  I think Justin Jefferson catches a TD. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5395.48s)]
*  The Vikings are losing, but Kurt Cousins is still throwing the ball a lot because they're [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5397.84s)]
*  losing. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5400.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5401.92s)]
*  I'm going more than half a touchdown. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5402.92s)]
*  I'm going less. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5403.92s)]
*  I'm going less. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5404.92s)]
*  I have to because you suggested it. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5405.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5406.92s)]
*  To me. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5407.92s)]

*  Okay, now let's get back to the show. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5453.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, what happens with the Pats? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5454.96s)]
*  Before we get out of here, what happens with the Pats? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5456.4800000000005s)]
*  Does Belichick win another ring? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5457.76s)]
*  I can tell you I'm scarred from that game yesterday against the Jets because I thought [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5460.08s)]
*  Mack looked good and then this coaching, I don't know what the fuck happened the second [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5465.36s)]
*  half. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5469.0s)]
*  They won the game. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5470.0s)]
*  It felt like a loss. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5471.0s)]
*  The Jets are so pathetic. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5472.0s)]
*  They let him in. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5473.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5474.0s)]
*  I don't, I'll say yes, but the tone of voice isn't the most convincing. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5475.12s)]
*  You got a lot of beasts. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5479.84s)]
*  I think Mack Jones is very good. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5481.84s)]
*  I don't, I don't know how Jacobi Myers, we let him go to the Steelers and got Juju Smith [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5483.32s)]
*  and Schuster for the same money. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5489.72s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5491.76s)]
*  It's been a rough patch. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5494.4800000000005s)]
*  Having said that, if the Pats don't win forever the rest of my life, I'll take it. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5496.16s)]
*  You're so blessed. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5499.96s)]
*  Now, what's your overall perception of Belichick post-Brady? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5500.96s)]
*  Does that taint his legacy? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5503.56s)]
*  As like in the coaching, not in your eyes, in the coaching echelon. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5505.96s)]
*  It doesn't. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5509.96s)]
*  To me, I get a lot of people because I really think he was largely responsible for the giant [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5511.16s)]
*  Super Bowls with the defense he had. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5516.4800000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5518.2s)]
*  So it's like he did it there and then he- [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5519.2s)]
*  Marcel never won a Super Bowl without Belichick. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5521.599999999999s)]
*  Correct, yeah, Belichick won without. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5523.88s)]
*  And if you remember, they, no, I got confused. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5526.72s)]
*  But I can see the argument. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5533.4s)]
*  I can certainly see the argument. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5534.76s)]
*  They made a mistake letting him go too early, Brady. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5535.88s)]
*  He still had years to play and then he goes and wins in Tampa. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5539.12s)]
*  So I certainly see the argument because the Patriots haven't been very good since. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5541.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5545.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just- [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5546.8s)]
*  It's the greatest run in history of sports. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5547.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5550.68s)]
*  The 20 year run. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5551.68s)]
*  It's been unbelievable. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5552.68s)]
*  But the Brady thing is so interesting. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5553.68s)]
*  He was on Patrick Bet David. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5555.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5557.04s)]
*  He's fantastic and they did a podcast that was kind of like live and he had Brady on [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5558.04s)]
*  him. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5561.96s)]
*  Brady was talking about this competitive- [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5562.96s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that just the other day. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5563.96s)]
*  And these clips are fantastic. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5565.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he cried during the Brady six. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5567.04s)]
*  He cried talking about six quarterbacks like on a documentary, crying that they were drafted [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5569.72s)]
*  ahead of him. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5574.320000000001s)]
*  That type of fucking, like him talking about how, like he was on some Jordan shit. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5575.48s)]
*  I need the enemy and I need the anger. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5579.719999999999s)]
*  I need to hate you. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5581.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, once I can hate you, I can get out there and be like, let's fucking go. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5582.679999999999s)]
*  But I love that. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5585.88s)]
*  I love someone going out there and wanting the other team to hate them and thriving off [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5586.88s)]
*  of that fucking- [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5593.12s)]
*  I didn't have friends on the other team. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5594.12s)]
*  What motivates you? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5595.12s)]
*  Are you one of those that- [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5596.12s)]
*  Y'all, for sure, hate. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5597.36s)]
*  Hate is a major. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5598.719999999999s)]
*  That is probably my fuel, like enemies. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5600.92s)]
*  And would you create an enemy that may array them everywhere? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5604.44s)]
*  But I mean, like, you know how Jordan would, he had a story- [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5608.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you need that for motivation sometimes? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5610.44s)]
*  Yeah, a lot. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5612.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5613.16s)]
*  I've always had it, so I don't know what I'd do without it. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5614.16s)]
*  But it's always there. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5616.639999999999s)]
*  Like that guy Kenji, he's going on an Ace of Spades bottle today, like no joke. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5617.719999999999s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5621.36s)]
*  What happened? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5622.36s)]
*  That's the guy from the- [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5623.36s)]
*  No, I know, but what- [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5624.36s)]
*  Oh, I- [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5625.36s)]
*  Oh, you're not popping it. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5626.36s)]
*  No, no. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5627.36s)]
*  You're just putting him down there and he's- [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5628.36s)]
*  He's getting you brave on the bottle and we'll put it on the shelf. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5629.36s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5630.36s)]
*  No way. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5631.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5632.36s)]
*  So I have a weird relationship with him because I hate his guts. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5634.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5637.719999999999s)]
*  Or at least I did. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5638.719999999999s)]
*  So really, I'm a Celtics fan. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5640.4s)]
*  So his tenure with the Celtics- [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5644.679999999999s)]
*  Not the best. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5646.679999999999s)]
*  Not good. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5647.679999999999s)]
*  And then I feel like he deserved all the hate he got. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5648.679999999999s)]
*  I feel like he turned it into Boston's racist city. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5651.719999999999s)]
*  Even like, if you stomp on the leprechaun in the middle of the garden- [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5654.44s)]
*  We're gonna call you- [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5659.24s)]
*  No, Kenji. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5660.4s)]
*  There's gonna be a couple of Jaru songs playing. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5662.4s)]
*  On repeat. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5665.4s)]
*  On fucking repeat. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5666.4s)]
*  So- [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5668.4s)]
*  On repeat. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5669.4s)]
*  On repeat. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5670.4s)]
*  No, we don't- I don't like him, but- So, and I've always said that. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5671.4s)]
*  I think he's a team killer. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5677.4s)]
*  I think everywhere he goes. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5678.4s)]
*  So I tweeted that the other day with the Mavs. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5679.4s)]
*  I'm like, why would the Mavs trade for him? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5681.4s)]
*  He's a certified team killer. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5683.4s)]
*  And he killed them. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5685.4s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5686.4s)]
*  I retweeted me, hey fucking big mouth, why don't you play me one on one? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5687.4s)]
*  So I was like, all right motherfucker, like what? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5693.4s)]
*  You think I- Let's play one on one. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5696.4s)]
*  And then it went a little deeper. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5699.4s)]
*  I also, as a Jewish guy, I thought his whole fucking way he handled the- [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5701.4s)]
*  When he put up that video was awful. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5705.4s)]
*  Put it up, fine. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5707.4s)]
*  Once people bring it to your attention, be like, all right, fine. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5708.4s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5712.4s)]
*  Like, he never really took a step back from that for a long time. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5713.4s)]
*  And I think he thought he was in the right, so he's digging his feet in. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5716.4s)]
*  Long story short, him and I now text each other the craziest texts, trying to set up this one on one where he's going to meet my family, I'm going to meet his family, and we're going to try to solve world peace together. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5719.4s)]
*  But it hasn't happened. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5732.4s)]
*  We've got a sit down one on one or playing ball one on one? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5733.4s)]
*  Playing ball one on one and then a sit down after. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5736.4s)]
*  Fuck no. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5739.4s)]
*  So why would you even do it? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5740.4s)]
*  Why did he have to lose? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5743.4s)]
*  Oh, Kyrie. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5744.4s)]
*  Oh, Kyrie. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5745.4s)]
*  I couldn't- [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5746.4s)]
*  Yeah, if Kyrie offers to play you one on one, you're going to take him up on that, but also to solve world hunger and all the other issues. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5747.4s)]
*  He wants to come eat. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5754.4s)]
*  He's like, we'll do it in your hometown, and then I'll come meet your parents. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5755.4s)]
*  You'll meet mine, because I think there's a lot of shit. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5758.4s)]
*  And we're supposed to do it by the end of August. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5762.4s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5765.4s)]
*  And then I'm like- [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5766.4s)]
*  You guys leave there like, the Jews are kind of annoying. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5767.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5769.4s)]
*  So I can't get a read on him. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5773.4s)]
*  I think he may be nuts. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5775.4s)]
*  At times, he sends paragraphs to me, like weird hours. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5776.4s)]
*  I mean- [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5783.4s)]
*  Off the record, what does he say? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5784.4s)]
*  He wouldn't even be able to make like real sense. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5785.4s)]
*  It's just like, he's trying to basically be like, listen, I just want peace, no hate, let's figure this out type stuff. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5789.4s)]
*  He is, I mean, he's a genius with a basketball. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5795.4s)]
*  Like his offensive game. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5798.4s)]
*  One on one handles. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5799.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just one on one, maybe we never see anything like it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5800.4s)]
*  I wonder if to think that outside the box to create a game like he has, because if you just ask any basketball player, just if off of offensive game, they're going to point at Kyrie in terms of skill. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5805.4s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5816.4s)]
*  Yeah, a lot do. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5817.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if there's one, maybe obviously KD can get his shot off no matter what. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5818.4s)]
*  But I don't think even KD would say, I'm nicer with a basketball than Kyrie in terms of just skill. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5822.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's definitely up there. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5829.4s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5831.4s)]
*  OK, it's magic watching. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5832.4s)]
*  Steph maybe as well, but even what he does. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5833.4s)]
*  OK, so maybe to be that much of an outside the box thinker to create that game and think about the game in that way. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5835.4s)]
*  The baggage of that is also to think about life in that way. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5843.4s)]
*  I mean, here's the thing with a team. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5846.4s)]
*  If you have a teammate, I assume you need to be able to depend on the guy to be on the court. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5848.4s)]
*  And for him, I don't care what he says. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5852.4s)]
*  You have not been able to depend on that for a whole host of reasons, whether it's he doesn't want to get the bags. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5854.4s)]
*  It's just always something. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5861.4s)]
*  So Kyrie's villain arc to me is LeBron's greatest success. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5864.4s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5869.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5870.4s)]
*  I know. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5871.4s)]
*  Well, I always hate LeBron. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5872.4s)]
*  So I was actually pro-Kyrie when before he came. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5873.4s)]
*  I'm like, Kyrie's the one you want. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5876.4s)]
*  He's the one who hit the shot, not you. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5878.4s)]
*  And then when he came to Boston, it was open arms. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5880.4s)]
*  But like the thing that drives me nuts most that's really started with Kyrie is he has this habit of talking about stuff and creating a story. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5883.4s)]
*  Hey, Kevin Durant, you want to play together at the All-Star game? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5892.4s)]
*  I'm going to leave Boston. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5896.4s)]
*  Then the Boston media will be like, do you want to leave Boston? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5897.4s)]
*  He's like, why are you asking me about that? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5899.4s)]
*  Because you motherfucker at the All-Star game was on camera talking about it. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5901.4s)]
*  Max Lutz. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5905.4s)]
*  So it's like you can't get mad when people ask questions. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5906.4s)]
*  I also hate when people like don't who take stuff away from like the fans. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5908.4s)]
*  The fans are why all athletes are making obscene amount of money and to treat them with no respect. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5913.4s)]
*  I find somehow it's sometimes tough to swallow. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5919.4s)]
*  Take stuff away from the fans? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5923.4s)]
*  Like when you don't appreciate. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5924.4s)]
*  When you act as if the fans are a nuisance. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5927.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5930.4s)]
*  It's like they're the reason why you're able to get paid. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5931.4s)]
*  So obviously they shouldn't be able to say anything to a player. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5933.4s)]
*  But there's going to be a certain amount of booing or cheering. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5936.4s)]
*  If you're going to take the max deal, you got to know what pays for the max deal. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5940.4s)]
*  100%. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5943.4s)]
*  If you took a minimum deal, it's like, yeah, don't fucking talk to me. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5944.4s)]
*  Cool. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5946.4s)]
*  Imagine an athlete said, imagine athlete said I will play for this is a max player. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5947.4s)]
*  He goes, I'll play for $2 million a year. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5954.4s)]
*  Only thing I request is nobody says anything mean to me while I'm playing. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5956.4s)]
*  To be honest, I think that would work for some people. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5960.4s)]
*  Boston would be silent. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5962.4s)]
*  It would work. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5963.4s)]
*  It would work. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5964.4s)]
*  It would. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5965.4s)]
*  I mean, that's that. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5966.4s)]
*  Listen, that's no different than anything in my company. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5967.4s)]
*  The employees who make the most money as a boss. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5969.4s)]
*  You expect the most. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5971.4s)]
*  Yeah, you keep an eye. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5972.4s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5973.4s)]
*  I get it. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5974.4s)]
*  There's some. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5975.4s)]
*  Fans go over the line. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5977.4s)]
*  No doubt about that. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5978.4s)]
*  But just a lack of appreciation. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5980.4s)]
*  Sometimes that as a fan, that fucking bothers me. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5983.4s)]
*  Dave Portnoy, my friend. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5986.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5989.4s)]

*  Make sure you check out the next pizza fest. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5993.4s)]

*  Has to do it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=5999.4s)]
*  Have to. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6000.4s)]
*  Raging success. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6001.4s)]
*  And maybe traveling a bit. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6002.4s)]
*  Yeah, we thought about it. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6003.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6004.4s)]
*  They might have to step up the pizza on the West Coast. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6005.4s)]
*  Or we bring the, I mean, that would be nuts. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6007.4s)]
*  Bring the iconics. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDM9CFoyXM&t=6010.4s)]
