*  He didn't say black people and Muslims. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  He said Nigerians and Ismailis, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=84.8s)]
*  which is like the smallest sect of Islam. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=86.64s)]
*  He was like, never trust them as far as you can throw them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=89.04s)]
*  I was like, what's going on? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=91.36s)]
*  This is so specific. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=93.2s)]
*  I'm going to choose to believe it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=94.32s)]
*  Why do Nigerians have that reputation? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=96.08s)]
*  Just a little scam shit? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=98.48s)]
*  Actually, they need money, man. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=99.92s)]
*  There's six populous country in the world, man. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=101.44s)]
*  There's too many of them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=103.12s)]
*  There's way too many of them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=104.4s)]
*  And there's not enough funds going around. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=105.52s)]
*  But does that same rep hit Britain as well or no? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=107.2s)]
*  Not as much as here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=112.8s)]
*  No one there as much as here, but I would say... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=113.6s)]
*  Why do we have it? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=115.84s)]
*  I would say it's like at you because we're Nigerian. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=116.56s)]
*  It's just it's going to follow us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=118.96000000000001s)]

*  Because didn't Drake do the same shit out there? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=471.84s)]
*  Like, he hopped in the grime scene just to steal a little bit from it and then he was out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  But it's crazy how we're looking at it, is like, steal a little from it, because we are, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  before this happened, we looked at Drake blessing people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=482.56s)]
*  It was the, I called it the Drake stimulus package. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=486.0s)]
*  It wasn't even like, I don't even think personally stealing at that time, because he like, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=488.8s)]
*  basically we have, you know, one dance. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=495.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=498.4s)]
*  That Drake song is sampled from a funky house song. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=499.36s)]
*  Funky house is a genre in the UK that was like very popular for like a very small amount of time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=501.28s)]
*  It never went international, but we loved it at like 2009, 2010. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=505.2s)]
*  And like the biggest song we had in funky house was that song that he sampled. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=510.32s)]
*  And like that song did more for funky house than like anything. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=514.8s)]
*  So we don't really think about it as like stealing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=517.6s)]
*  It's like, oh wow. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=519.52s)]
*  Put them on. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  It's paying homage, man. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=520.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=522.72s)]
*  So why do you, it's so weird that there's hate even out there for Drake. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=524.16s)]
*  Do you think it's just like being on the top, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=528.4s)]
*  eventually there's people who build resentment for sustained greatness? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=530.64s)]
*  Yes, long story short. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=535.04s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=535.68s)]
*  Long story short. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=536.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=536.88s)]
*  He's doing so many side missions now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=538.56s)]
*  It's pointless. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  He's doing so many side missions. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  There was a phase, in my opinion, there was a phase he was either featuring or [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  having people feature on his stuff. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=548.2399999999999s)]
*  Whereas like he doesn't need to be doing this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, it just continued and continued and continued. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=551.92s)]
*  People are hating on it, I guess. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=555.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=556.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is a weird time. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  By the way, we're here with Shits and Gigs. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=561.76s)]

*  that I have invested in. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  This is important to me, not only because it is owned and run [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  and operated by my brother, Arjun Gupta, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=960.3599999999999s)]

*  Notice there was a void of actual really good chai. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=967.52s)]
*  No disrespect to anybody else. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=971.04s)]
*  But we felt there was not truly good chai in New York. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=972.6s)]
*  So they opened a chai shop. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=975.96s)]
*  They also serve wine. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=977.88s)]
*  But chai is the thing I'm focusing on. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=978.84s)]
*  It's called Fontanious. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=980.48s)]
*  It's in Dumbo, 28 J Street. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=981.48s)]

*  And he said that unprompted. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=990.28s)]
*  That's why I made him say it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=991.88s)]
*  I'm so proud of my brother. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=993.16s)]

*  and you wanna be expressive. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1362.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1363.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1364.36s)]
*  And you need an excuse because maybe it's like, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1365.2s)]
*  you had a stiff upper lip. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1367.56s)]
*  If you're sad, hold it down. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1368.44s)]
*  If you're happy, you hold it down. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1369.56s)]
*  Valid. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1371.2s)]
*  That is valid. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1372.04s)]
*  Just feeling something emotionally [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1372.8600000000001s)]
*  and having that like just fly out of your body. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1374.64s)]
*  The first reaction is, oh, should I, is this okay? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1376.88s)]
*  Now you guys are minorities. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1380.04s)]
*  So you have your cultural influence as well. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1381.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1383.44s)]
*  You know, like for example, in the States, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1384.28s)]
*  like the most emotional people are Latinos. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1385.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1387.6000000000001s)]
*  There's no restriction on any emotion. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1388.44s)]
*  If they feel happy about seeing their kid, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1391.18s)]
*  they can cry and nobody's like, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1394.58s)]
*  look at this fucking pussy crying. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1396.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1397.4199999999998s)]
*  They feel like that's beautiful. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1398.26s)]
*  If they feel sad about losing, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1399.08s)]
*  they can let, all the emotion can come out. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1400.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1402.62s)]
*  And I feel like British is like almost the opposite of that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1403.46s)]
*  where it's just like, keep it in. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1405.86s)]
*  Very valid. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1408.74s)]
*  Very valid as well, yeah. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1409.58s)]
*  I've gone. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1411.1s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1412.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm not, to be fair. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1413.74s)]
*  I'm trying to find holes in the argument. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1415.34s)]
*  I actually can't find it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1417.54s)]
*  I'm sure I'm being reductive, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1418.3799999999999s)]
*  but I wonder if there's a, yeah, I don't know. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1420.22s)]
*  Maybe your guys show where you guys are so gregarious [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1424.8600000000001s)]
*  and you're having such a good time, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1428.82s)]
*  you're showing so much emotion. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1429.98s)]
*  To me, it's not surprising that it's so popular [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1431.14s)]
*  because I think a lot of people naturally do feel that way. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1433.22s)]
*  And then they see some guys reacting and sharing stories [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1435.5s)]
*  kind of the way that they want to react. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1439.66s)]
*  Yeah, laughing and loving it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1441.82s)]
*  It makes them feel comfortable. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1443.66s)]
*  And they're like, oh my God, these are my fucking. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1444.5s)]
*  That's like the biggest feedback we get, for sure. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1445.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it makes them feel comfortable [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1446.5s)]
*  feeling the feelings that they actually have. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1447.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1450.26s)]
*  I was thinking that could be one of the factors [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1451.1000000000001s)]
*  of your success is just like you're watching [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1452.6000000000001s)]
*  that clip and it's like, oh, that's so fun. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1454.82s)]
*  And especially if you feel like we're not as allowed to be [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1457.06s)]
*  and be watching these guys be so emotional [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1459.66s)]
*  and then talking about how you miss him all the time [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1462.06s)]
*  and just so open, like it's just so freeing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1464.26s)]
*  If you're from, even for me watching it, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1467.1s)]
*  but I'm assuming if you're from a more reserved culture, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1469.26s)]
*  even more so. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1471.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's definitely like a case of like [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1472.74s)]
*  the stuff that we talk about on our show [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1474.6399999999999s)]
*  and the way we are on our show is how we will always be [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1475.98s)]
*  within our friendship group. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1479.62s)]
*  But yeah, you're right, no one will ever see that. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1481.62s)]
*  That's like when we get together, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1483.38s)]
*  in public we're not like that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1485.5s)]
*  I should have caveated that is that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1486.8200000000002s)]
*  within intimate relationships, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1489.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you can express that emotion. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1490.98s)]
*  But what is the public facing persona? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1492.9s)]
*  And I feel like that exists in America with like, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1495.14s)]
*  you guys have WASP culture. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1498.14s)]
*  What's that? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1501.24s)]
*  White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1502.0800000000002s)]
*  This is like the last remnants of like British culture [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1504.0200000000002s)]
*  I think in America where there's like the elites [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1506.1000000000001s)]
*  that go to Harvard. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1508.7800000000002s)]
*  Old money types. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1509.98s)]
*  Old money types. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1510.94s)]
*  And they have dual personalities, right? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1512.3799999999999s)]
*  There's like this one like very refined small talk, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1513.8999999999999s)]
*  how are you? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1517.18s)]
*  How's the weather been? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1518.02s)]
*  The kids good? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1518.8999999999999s)]
*  All this kind of professional shit. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1519.74s)]
*  And then they have another personality [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1521.42s)]
*  which is like degenerate gamblers [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1522.98s)]
*  that are shoving zins in their fucking mouth [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1524.98s)]
*  and just having fun. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1526.86s)]
*  And that second one is probably more true. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1527.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1530.1s)]
*  So I wonder if you guys are showcasing this side [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1532.3s)]
*  that everybody out there has, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1534.92s)]
*  but they don't a lot of time showcase it on TV [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1536.36s)]
*  or maybe even in film. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1539.54s)]
*  Very valid, fucking hell. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1542.4599999999998s)]
*  We're peeling back layers. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1544.4599999999998s)]
*  Very fucking valid. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1546.54s)]
*  But there's some other creators out there [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1547.6599999999999s)]
*  that I've also watched that have, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1549.86s)]
*  that they also are very kind of emotional. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1552.1s)]
*  There's, you know, Chunks and Philly. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1554.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we love Chunks and Philly. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1556.7399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and like obviously you know them. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1557.7399999999998s)]
*  But like, I feel like they're also, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1559.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm watching them and I'm like, oh wow, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1560.78s)]
*  they're very like emotional. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1562.12s)]
*  They're showcasing expressive. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1563.58s)]
*  And to me it's like way more relatable [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1564.9399999999998s)]
*  as an American watching it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1567.6s)]
*  And I think they're really successful out there too. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1569.38s)]
*  They're crazy successful, bro. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1572.5400000000002s)]
*  But I think it's cool that you guys are sharing that side. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1573.8200000000002s)]
*  The clip that made me a fan was the story [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1576.0200000000002s)]
*  of you cheating on your girl in college [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1578.8200000000002s)]
*  and then him storming out of the club. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1581.5400000000002s)]
*  It was if he was my girl. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1583.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, you gotta hear this. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1584.5s)]
*  Have you not heard this story? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1585.3400000000001s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1586.3400000000001s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=1587.18s)]

*  and I'm not I am, I was a dog in my past. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2220.56s)]
*  I have been a dog. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2222.7200000000003s)]

*  I don't know, I just, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2230.88s)]
*  I don't know, I just, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2232.52s)]

*  as other people have been. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2236.68s)]
*  And I feel like when it comes to like shit stories, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2238.16s)]
*  I'm mostly fucked up when I'm in relationships, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2243.52s)]
*  which is bad, because I want best of both worlds sometimes. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2245.52s)]
*  Got it, got it, got it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2248.28s)]

*  I'm a coward, I can't break up with someone. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2250.76s)]
*  I'm terrible at shit like that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2252.68s)]

*  Terrible at breaking up with people. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2259.64s)]
*  So it's, because you don't want to be the bad guy. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2260.72s)]
*  And no, I don't want to be the villain in their story, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2262.68s)]
*  do you know what I mean? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2264.3599999999997s)]

*  I like that. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2269.2799999999997s)]
*  Just don't see me like that. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2270.12s)]
*  But I come home to a loving family, you know what I'm saying? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2271.12s)]
*  It's one of those ones, man, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2274.3999999999996s)]
*  but there are some exes that will tell you [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2275.56s)]

*  Yeah. For sure. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2278.9599999999996s)]
*  When did you become less, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2280.04s)]
*  I don't want to say less religious, but like practicing? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2282.3999999999996s)]
*  Pretty early, to be fair. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2286.56s)]
*  I would- Did you miss it at all? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2288.0s)]
*  No, because, not really with my current life now, no, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2289.4s)]
*  because religion, Islam was somewhat forced onto me [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2293.04s)]
*  because of my family. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2296.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2297.1600000000003s)]

*  well, my parents are Nigerian Muslims, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2298.84s)]
*  so they practice and they want us to practice and blah, blah, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2301.44s)]
*  blah. Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2303.92s)]
*  So they said we should go to Islamic schools [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2304.76s)]
*  and on the weekends, they like to learn the religion, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2307.44s)]
*  things like that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2309.2000000000003s)]
*  But it wasn't interesting for me, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2310.04s)]
*  I did it because they asked me to do [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2311.6s)]
*  or they told me to do it. Right. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2313.28s)]

*  He started thinking about them types cheating. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2325.44s)]
*  Yeah, damn it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2327.04s)]
*  I was like, what was I? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2327.88s)]
*  Just talking about your relationship with religion. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2332.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2334.1200000000003s)]
*  It just didn't really do much for me. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2334.96s)]
*  And I felt like, again, this is no take on anyone [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  that is religious or whatever. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2340.8s)]
*  I just feel like the time in my life I was going through, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  I just doesn't really fancy religion in the slightest. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2344.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2347.52s)]
*  I can appreciate the fact that I am, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2348.6s)]
*  my family are religious, but I don't practice. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2350.56s)]
*  And I say that, people ask me, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2352.56s)]
*  I'm naturally Muslim or born Muslim, but I don't practice. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2354.0s)]
*  Can I ask you guys a question? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2356.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2357.92s)]
*  You've noticed Arabic words becoming part of [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  popular vernacular and lexicon. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2362.92s)]
*  Is that Arabic influence in British culture [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2364.96s)]
*  and maybe Canadian culture, or is that African influence? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2370.08s)]
*  Insha'Allah is just a thing everybody says, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2375.32s)]
*  regardless if you're Muslim or not. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2377.64s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2379.92s)]
*  When did this become popular? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2381.28s)]
*  I can't speak for, I think obviously there are massive- [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2385.16s)]
*  Wallahi, you hear a lot of people say. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2388.76s)]
*  Masha'Allah is wallahi. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  Masha'Allah, yeah. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2392.08s)]
*  I think you referenced like chunks of Philly earlier. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2393.36s)]
*  Chunks is- [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2396.12s)]
*  A devout Muslim. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2397.2000000000003s)]
*  A devout Muslim. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2398.04s)]
*  So he will use a lot of Arabic words. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2399.08s)]
*  There's a big, in terms of like UK YouTubers, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2401.84s)]
*  there's a huge Muslim community now on YouTube [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2405.52s)]
*  and in social media and stuff like that. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2410.04s)]
*  And it is becoming- [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2411.6400000000003s)]
*  So if you're influencing culture, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2413.04s)]
*  and that is part of your culture, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2414.7200000000003s)]
*  everybody's gonna take on those things. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2416.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, for sure, man. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2418.96s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2420.04s)]
*  And that's happened in your adulthood [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2421.04s)]
*  or even in your childhood, you notice that? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2423.48s)]
*  Because I didn't remember hearing it when I was a kid. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2425.2400000000002s)]
*  When I was a kid, it did not happen for me at all, for sure. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2427.0800000000004s)]
*  I feel like two years ago. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2428.96s)]
*  I'm my Muslim friends who say it all the time. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2430.2000000000003s)]
*  But I started hearing other people, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2431.92s)]
*  like y'all were saying in the text, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2433.16s)]
*  and I was like, are y'all making fun of it? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2434.16s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2435.88s)]
*  And then I found out it was like slang now. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2436.72s)]
*  Yeah, is that weird to like, maybe as a kid, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2438.64s)]
*  I don't know how you grew up or what your community was, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2441.7599999999998s)]
*  but to feel like almost like I'm different [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2443.72s)]
*  for having these beliefs or having to go to Muslim school. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2446.3199999999997s)]
*  And then as an adult- [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  I felt different, for sure. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2450.12s)]
*  All these white kids are saying, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2450.96s)]
*  inshallah, wallahi. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2452.16s)]
*  Because I don't practice, I don't necessarily give a fuck. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2455.0s)]
*  Right, but if you did, you'd be like, yo, where was this? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2457.56s)]
*  If I did, I may have a different connotation [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  about it, but I would definitely say, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2461.52s)]
*  I agree with your point, like back in the day, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2462.8s)]
*  it kind of felt like very different being Muslim, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2464.92s)]
*  because everyone around me was Christian. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2468.7599999999998s)]
*  Everyone around me was Christian. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2471.36s)]
*  So it felt very, and again, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2472.68s)]
*  because it wasn't something I truly believed in, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2474.12s)]
*  it was something my family told me that we should do, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2476.92s)]
*  because, you know, well, my parents are Muslim, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2479.8s)]
*  this, that, and you know, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2482.44s)]
*  and my sister practiced a lot, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2483.28s)]
*  and she still practices now. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2484.4s)]
*  So it was one of those ones [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2485.7599999999998s)]
*  where I was always being compared. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2486.6s)]
*  So for me, it was more, the more I got compared, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2488.68s)]
*  the more I wanted to repress on it. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2490.68s)]
*  You got brothers in your family? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2492.0s)]
*  No, just sister, just me and my sister. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2493.08s)]
*  And the parents were very like, this one is the favorite? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2494.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say the favorite, but more so like level-headed, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2499.6s)]
*  whereas I was more of a scatterbrain. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2503.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2505.64s)]
*  So I do feel immigrant parents love to compare. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2506.48s)]
*  If it's not your brother or sister, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2509.3999999999996s)]
*  look at this kid. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2511.08s)]
*  This kid is at this program, you know what I mean? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2512.64s)]
*  Why aren't you like him? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2515.12s)]
*  You get a lot of that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2515.96s)]
*  It's soul-destroying sometimes. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2516.7999999999997s)]
*  Especially when you're with dad-arts. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2518.8s)]
*  Tell me what the craziest shit that they said was. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2520.84s)]
*  It's not, the thing is, it's not crazy. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2523.84s)]
*  It's when you like deep back at it, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2525.6000000000004s)]
*  and you think, why would you even say that to your child? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2528.44s)]
*  Then when you actually think about it, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2531.96s)]
*  I don't care now, but like. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2533.04s)]
*  Give me some good shit. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2535.04s)]
*  So I could fail a test, for example, like a math test. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2536.04s)]
*  And I enjoyed maths back in the day. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2539.5600000000004s)]
*  I could fail a maths test, and my dad would be like, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2540.84s)]
*  did the person that got first have two heads? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2543.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, why the fuck are you telling me this more? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2546.44s)]
*  Try and help me, bro. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2549.52s)]
*  I just hated, I think every African [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2553.08s)]
*  just hated being compared. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2556.44s)]
*  It's just natural. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2558.0s)]
*  It's natural for our parents' generation [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2559.04s)]
*  to compare their kids to other people. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2560.9199999999996s)]
*  It's natural. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2563.08s)]
*  A lot of similarities, yeah. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2563.9199999999996s)]
*  It's natural, bro. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2564.96s)]
*  It's jarring. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2565.8799999999997s)]
*  Jarring is annoying. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2566.72s)]
*  I got it, I got it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2568.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucked. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2569.7599999999998s)]
*  I would get, they're doing this, and what are you doing? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2570.96s)]
*  They wouldn't just say they're doing this. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2574.12s)]
*  This guy's in this class, and this class is getting all this, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2576.08s)]
*  and what are you doing? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2578.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'd get up more with my sister. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2579.08s)]
*  Because my sister, again, like I said, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2580.7599999999998s)]
*  straight, narrow-headed, blah, blah, blah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2581.9199999999996s)]
*  And I was a bit more wayward, I loved sports, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2583.3999999999996s)]
*  I didn't really focus on education, this, that, the other. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2586.04s)]
*  Yeah, the comparisons used to fuck with me. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2588.4399999999996s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2590.12s)]
*  My mom would coddle the shit out of me. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2590.96s)]
*  She was like, maybe you just had a bad day or something. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2592.12s)]
*  Do we get the next one? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2594.6s)]
*  Bad day? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2595.6s)]
*  Bad day. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2596.4399999999996s)]
*  That's a loving mother. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2597.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2598.12s)]
*  That's why Tina's with sons. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2598.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=2600.16s)]

*  It's prison. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3323.56s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3324.56s)]
*  You wouldn't suck his dick to save his life, but you would get fucked in your ass to save [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3326.56s)]
*  his life. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3330.56s)]

*  I'll be so tight. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3575.4399999999996s)]
*  When Bruce came to cut my head the other day, and he was like trimming under here and he [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3576.4399999999996s)]
*  goes, lift your head up. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3580.7599999999998s)]
*  And I lift my head up, he's like, a little bit more. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3581.7599999999998s)]
*  And then he put his fingers under here, mate. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3584.2799999999997s)]
*  I opened my eyes like that, he was looking at me like that. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3586.9599999999996s)]
*  I was like, fucking prick. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3589.9599999999996s)]
*  But I was like... [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3590.9599999999996s)]
*  You know the one where he was lining them up with the dildo? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3591.9599999999996s)]
*  He was just... [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3596.9599999999996s)]
*  He was lining up the dildo. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3598.2s)]
*  I mean, Bruce! [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3601.2s)]
*  I'm fucking serious. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3602.2s)]
*  So you're saying that within younger teens, there's more pause culture still popping? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3603.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3609.2s)]
*  But recently, it wasn't even that, it was probably like six months ago, we made a clip [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3610.2s)]
*  where I asked him, what would he get me for Christmas? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3614.2s)]
*  If I was your girl, what would you do for me for my best Christmas present? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3617.4s)]
*  And he told me, and I made a joke, I was like, oh, you want me to suck the skin off your [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3622.2400000000002s)]
*  dick? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3625.96s)]
*  And then the teacher... [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3626.96s)]
*  He's circo, you know what I mean? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3627.96s)]
*  That shit's gonna be taut! [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3630.96s)]
*  A plus cultural risk. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3641.96s)]
*  A teacher, she teached like year nine, so like ninth grade, she came up to me, she was [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3643.96s)]
*  like, oh, the weirdest shit happened is that she was in class and one of the kids, one [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3648.96s)]
*  of the black kids, another kid was like, oh, bro, if you give me a pencil, I'll suck the [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3654.96s)]
*  skin off your dick. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3658.88s)]
*  And then everyone in the class was laughing. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3660.12s)]
*  And like, she was like, that's because of that clip that you said, whereas like, no, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3662.44s)]
*  there will never be another time where someone can make that kind of sauce joke and not get [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3666.96s)]
*  smacked. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3670.96s)]
*  And now it's like, more like it's just funny to do it. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3671.96s)]
*  And she was like, I've never seen anything like it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3675.52s)]
*  Were you always cool with those jokes? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3677.4s)]
*  Or like, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3678.96s)]
*  No, to be fair, it was more about, it was actually starting the show that made, that [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3679.96s)]
*  makes me more comfortable talking shit about whatever and like being a bit more vulnerable [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3684.92s)]
*  and a bit more like pushing it a little bit in terms of just like, it started off like [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3691.64s)]
*  talking about like our insecurities and shit, like not that tall or this or that and that [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3696.6s)]
*  and that. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3701.2000000000003s)]
*  And then you realize that it's just, it's all jokes. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3702.2000000000003s)]
*  Everyone finds it funny. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3704.52s)]
*  It's also what everybody feels. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3705.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3706.76s)]
*  It's exactly what everybody is feeling. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3707.76s)]
*  Everyone here and you just get like more reinforcement of just like, everyone feels the same, everyone [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3708.76s)]
*  feels the same. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3712.48s)]
*  And then you push it a little bit more and then you've, yeah, and then you can make like [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3713.56s)]
*  a ridiculous joke. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3716.48s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, everyone's making the same joke. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3717.48s)]
*  And you're like, oh, raw. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3720.44s)]
*  Like this, that's, that's fucking insane. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3722.12s)]
*  Now the stakes have been reduced. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3723.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3725.08s)]
*  You don't feel like it's taboo because everybody's in on the joke. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3726.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3728.28s)]
*  You remember a clip or episode or moment where you're like, oh, this is, this is the fun. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3729.28s)]
*  Culture. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3732.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3733.28s)]
*  What was the first moment where you're like, oh shit, culture, like this impacted and went [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3734.28s)]
*  viral while we got something. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3736.4s)]
*  And even just like, oh, this is the fun part of the pod. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3737.88s)]
*  This is the fun of the pod. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3740.08s)]
*  This is what it is. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3741.2s)]
*  I would like to know both. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3742.2s)]
*  It definitely would have been a time of a role playing or something, but I can't necessarily [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3743.9199999999996s)]
*  think. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3747.7999999999997s)]
*  I know when I said role play, your mind went elsewhere because you're a dirty motherfucker. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3748.7999999999997s)]
*  Get back in the room. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3753.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, get back in the room. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3754.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3757.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3758.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm a snake and you're your dick. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3759.7999999999997s)]
*  Actually, to be fair, it was probably, do you miss me? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3766.7999999999997s)]
*  That clip? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3769.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3770.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3771.7999999999997s)]
*  That was stupid. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3773.4s)]
*  And even till now, like, that was probably over a year ago. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3774.4s)]
*  That was probably like two years ago. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3776.0s)]
*  Maybe, yeah. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3777.0s)]
*  And then like, even till now, every comment on every, like the top comment on any clip [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3778.0s)]
*  they ever do was like, do you miss me when I'm not around? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3783.1200000000003s)]
*  And like that one is like till now, cause it was talking about other friends, Toby, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3786.0s)]
*  like people would come up in the street. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3789.1600000000003s)]
*  It was me talking about being jealous that he spends time with Toby more than he spends [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3790.48s)]
*  time with me. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3793.36s)]
*  So even now, like strangers would come up to me like, oh, where's Toby? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3794.36s)]
*  I was like, bro, that's two fucking years ago. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3796.36s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3798.36s)]
*  And that was, that was definitely for me. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3799.36s)]
*  That was the one where I was like, damn. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3801.16s)]
*  You know, it's funny, when I think about your guys' show and like the numbers you guys are [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3803.16s)]
*  doing, it's not, it's obviously not only in the UK. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3807.2799999999997s)]
*  But if you think about it within the amount of people in the UK, it's a pretty large percentage [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3811.04s)]
*  of the people. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3817.44s)]
*  Like if you do an episode and it's getting hundreds of thousands of views, millions of [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3818.44s)]
*  views, whatever it is, and there's what, 19 million people in the UK? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3821.68s)]
*  How many people? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3825.36s)]
*  64 million in the UK. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3826.36s)]
*  But just, I'm sorry, just in England, how many? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3827.36s)]
*  Oh, in England. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3828.88s)]
*  Oh, fuck knows. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3829.88s)]
*  But still, that's like a good percentage. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3831.6800000000003s)]
*  So the chances of you walking down the street and somebody saw an episode, especially within [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3833.2400000000002s)]
*  like a younger demographic, are pretty high. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3838.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, bro, of course. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  So these, the things that you say, the chance are they are understanding, they are knowing, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3841.84s)]
*  they are impacting culture. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3847.2400000000002s)]
*  Whereas like if you're doing the same numbers in China, it can be a huge pod, but a million [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3848.2400000000002s)]
*  out of two billion. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3854.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3855.36s)]
*  It's not going to be the same kind of recognition. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3857.04s)]
*  So you guys might be like objectively much bigger within the UK because of the amount [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3859.2s)]
*  of people there that are watching it. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3865.6s)]
*  Yeah, I get you. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3867.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3868.0s)]
*  Do you feel that way? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3869.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3870.0s)]
*  Like we definitely like, it's, the reason, it's funny you say that the reason, when we [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3871.0s)]
*  started the podcast, so we started the show like five years ago, and the reason, one of [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3874.48s)]
*  the reasons I wanted to start it was because at that time, podcasting from the way I perceived [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3877.52s)]
*  it was like very niche, that you could be very well known and famous within a very small, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3882.7599999999998s)]
*  and you can live off that and you can walk down the street and no one bothers you and [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3888.08s)]
*  only people who know who you are know who you are. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3891.56s)]
*  And you're like, you're living the best of both worlds. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3893.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the ideal. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3895.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3896.56s)]
*  And now our life is not that. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3897.56s)]
*  It's not the same. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3898.56s)]
*  It's transition. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3899.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3900.56s)]
*  Like going out on the street, we can't go to restaurants, we don't go out, don't really [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3901.56s)]
*  go shopping. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3903.72s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3904.72s)]
*  Yeah, we can't do nothing. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3905.72s)]
*  But there are advantages, like if you want to go to a restaurant all of a sudden, you [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3906.72s)]
*  get the Rezzi and everything's cool. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3909.2s)]
*  Yeah, and it's super helpful, like even like coming here, like the TSA agents and stuff [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3911.0s)]
*  like that know who you are. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3915.52s)]
*  They recognize you. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3916.52s)]
*  America's our biggest audience. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3917.96s)]
*  Yeah, but really? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3918.96s)]
*  By numbers, because we have so many. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3919.96s)]
*  Yeah, but y'all are selling out. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3921.96s)]
*  They're doing town hall here. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3925.08s)]
*  Yeah, so explain to me what the live show is, because you guys aren't standups as far [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3926.44s)]
*  as I'm concerned. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3931.56s)]
*  So what do you do in the live show? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3932.56s)]
*  I'm always curious about who is the best live podcast. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3934.84s)]
*  We try and make it more interactive. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3938.72s)]
*  Yeah, we try. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3941.2s)]
*  I think that's smart. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3942.2s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3943.2s)]
*  So give me an example of what it would look like, the live show. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3944.2s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3945.7599999999998s)]
*  This feels like I'm trying to set you guys up to pitch your tour. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3947.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm genuinely curious. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3949.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you what we did for the O2 show, because that's different. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3950.6800000000003s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3954.4s)]
*  Yeah, we sold out. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3955.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3956.4s)]
*  Bravo, bra fucking bra. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3957.4s)]
*  But yeah, explain what the live show is and how you make the podcast live the most engaging. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3958.4s)]
*  So I think for us, it's easier because our show is very segment based. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3964.6000000000004s)]
*  So we have the opportunity to mix and match. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3969.1600000000003s)]
*  So we can do something that's like very, very out there and very, very like not close [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3971.32s)]
*  to what we do in the studio at all. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3977.36s)]
*  And then we can be like, okay, cool, guys, something you know, let's sit down. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3978.96s)]
*  And then like, it was so crazy in the O2 is that we did, we have like a segment called [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3982.92s)]
*  Confessions. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3986.7200000000003s)]
*  And then when we sat down at O2, it was like, cool, time for Confessions. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3988.04s)]
*  Sit down and you could hear a pin drop. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3991.52s)]
*  And everyone was silent. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3993.1600000000003s)]
*  Because they're locked in. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3994.1600000000003s)]
*  And they're locked in. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3995.1600000000003s)]
*  Because they're like, okay, cool. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3996.1600000000003s)]
*  This is like the podcast. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3997.1600000000003s)]
*  This is what I'm used to. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3998.1600000000003s)]
*  This is the studio. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=3999.1600000000003s)]
*  So we read like Reddit or things like that. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4001.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4004.0s)]
*  Just Confessions have been submitted to us and all that kind of shit. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4005.0s)]
*  And then one of the segments that we did there was like story time. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4006.0s)]
*  So I told like a 20 minute story. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4009.12s)]
*  But to make it more applicable for them, we had it animated. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4011.2s)]
*  So we had it on like a big screen. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4014.48s)]
*  So we had the whole story animated. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4015.48s)]
*  Oh, that's sick. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4016.48s)]
*  So as I told the story, it was like the animation was going on like that. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4017.48s)]
*  And again, like completely like engaging. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4019.92s)]
*  Engaging. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4021.6s)]
*  Silently. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4022.6s)]
*  Couldn't hear a pin. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4023.6s)]
*  Nerves initially, you guys public speaking. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4024.6s)]
*  Is that something you're comfortable with? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4025.6s)]
*  You're performing in front of thousands of people. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4027.04s)]
*  Now I'm very much more comfortable. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4028.04s)]
*  But first, what happens? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4030.2799999999997s)]
*  What's going through your head? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4031.2799999999997s)]
*  Are you? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4032.2799999999997s)]
*  Overthinking, anxious, but it helps because there's two of us on stage. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4033.2799999999997s)]
*  And a lot of the time, especially in the studio, I'm just talking to James or like nowadays [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4038.04s)]
*  talking to Rem and Ellis as well. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4043.2s)]
*  But I don't do it to speak to the camera or speak to the audience. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4044.56s)]
*  I do it to speak to James, make James laugh. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4047.6s)]
*  So I translate that onto the stage as well. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4049.56s)]
*  Are you still speaking to James or are you speaking to the audience and James when you're [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4051.7599999999998s)]
*  doing the live performance? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4057.08s)]
*  I am. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4058.24s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4059.24s)]
*  I'm doing both, but I'm still more so speaking to James, you know, so. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4060.24s)]
*  But you're like aware that they're there. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4063.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm aware that they're there, but my nerves are gone because I know I'm just speaking [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4065.0s)]
*  to James. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4068.2s)]
*  You're speaking to James at them. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4069.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4070.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4071.2s)]
*  And I think it translates really, really well because like in terms of like the comedy aspect [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4072.2s)]
*  of it, I will only ever say something that I think will make him laugh. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4075.04s)]
*  And because lucky for us, like we don't have to do stuff where we're doing shows for audiences [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4079.0s)]
*  that don't get it. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4085.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4086.08s)]
*  We only ever do shows. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4087.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4088.92s)]
*  So I can say something to him that I know will make him laugh. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4089.92s)]
*  And because I know it'll make him laugh, it will make everyone laugh. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4092.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4095.24s)]
*  Because they all get it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4096.24s)]
*  And they're just like a lot of times they might not even find it funny, but they're [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4097.24s)]
*  laughing on behalf of you because they get him so much and vice versa. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4099.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4103.8s)]
*  So it works really, really well. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4105.04s)]
*  So it becomes this like big friend hangout. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4106.04s)]
*  100%. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4108.48s)]
*  And now they're living live what they've experienced every single day while they're [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4109.6s)]
*  working or at home. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4114.12s)]
*  And they want to interject in these conversations. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4116.12s)]
*  You hear this, I'm sure a lot of people listen to podcasts. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4118.04s)]
*  It's like they're hanging with their friends. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4120.16s)]
*  They just can't comment. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4121.96s)]
*  And now they're in the fucking room. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4122.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4124.72s)]
*  And do you give them opportunities to engage? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4125.84s)]
*  Are you doing like... [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4128.28s)]
*  On this tour we will. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4129.28s)]
*  So we've got like a couple of segments where people will come on and stuff like that. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4130.28s)]
*  And I mean, they got to have questions to ask you guys for like years. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4133.08s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4136.12s)]
*  So we get that as well. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4137.12s)]
*  So like you've got like different opportunities, obviously like meet and greets and shit like [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4138.12s)]
*  that we can do it. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4140.04s)]
*  But like on stage and stuff like that, like it gives them... [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4141.04s)]
*  You guys reacting live to these things that people are saying. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4143.76s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4147.12s)]
*  To me that's... [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4148.12s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4149.12s)]
*  Because if you're reacting to like the things that people are saying on Reddit, that's always [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4150.12s)]
*  fun. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4152.96s)]
*  People do it. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4153.96s)]
*  And now you have the opportunity to do it live. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4154.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4155.96s)]
*  And they're there. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4156.96s)]
*  That person who did this embarrassing thing, you get to see their face when you guys react [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4157.96s)]
*  to it or when you guys relate to it. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4161.68s)]
*  Like to me, that's the magic. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4164.08s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot of fun, bro. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4165.08s)]
*  It's good shit. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4168.08s)]
*  The times that we have done it, it's done like really well. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4169.08s)]
*  And then also just imagine what it's like for that fan who's watched people submit questions [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4170.72s)]
*  all the time and now they're on stage, they're freaking out, they're so fucking terrified. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4176.32s)]
*  They just want to meet you guys. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4179.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fun moment. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4180.92s)]
*  Yeah, the balancing act is really difficult though. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4182.16s)]
*  Because the moment is super big for them. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4185.2s)]
*  So like you said, they're there and they're terrified and all this shit has happened. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4187.759999999999s)]
*  Like we've made mistakes before where like I've given someone the mic and be like, go [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4190.719999999999s)]
*  for it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4194.04s)]
*  And they're just like... [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4195.04s)]
*  They run with it. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4196.04s)]
*  Or they fumble. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4197.04s)]
*  You can't give them the responsibility to entertain. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4198.04s)]
*  You guys are still the entertainers. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4201.679999999999s)]
*  But they can be the stimulus to entertain off of. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4203.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4205.76s)]
*  We've had moments on there before where like all it takes is like just one comment from [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4206.76s)]
*  them that lands so perfectly and it just like shuts down the entire building. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4212.76s)]
*  And it's just like the best fucking feeling in the world where you don't rely on them [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4217.240000000001s)]
*  whatsoever. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4222.320000000001s)]
*  So it gives them the opportunity to relax. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4223.320000000001s)]
*  And then when they want to say their piece, they know what they want to say and they get [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4225.08s)]
*  it and they're inside it and they actually feel like I'm on here with these guys. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4228.200000000001s)]
*  I know these are my friends. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4232.88s)]
*  Which is like their dream. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4233.88s)]
*  I'm like shooting the shit with my friends and then when they feel comfortable and they'll [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4234.92s)]
*  drop that one line and no one's expecting it and everyone's like the fucking whole place [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4237.28s)]
*  just shuts down. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4242.52s)]
*  It's so sick. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4243.52s)]
*  It's a good feeling. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4244.52s)]
*  It's a great feeling. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4245.52s)]
*  What was the coolest venue you guys have done? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4246.52s)]
*  The O2. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4247.52s)]
*  O2. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4248.52s)]
*  O2, 100%. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4249.52s)]
*  That's 100%. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4250.52s)]
*  How many people you have in it? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4251.52s)]
*  15,000. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4253.52s)]
*  Fuck me. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4254.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4255.52s)]
*  That was insane. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4256.52s)]
*  That was sick. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4257.52s)]
*  That was sick. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4258.52s)]
*  I mean that's... [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4259.52s)]
*  Did you walk out on the stage before anybody was there? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4260.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4263.04s)]
*  That's a pretty awesome moment. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4264.2s)]
*  When we walked in like months before when there was nothing there, just the seats, we [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4266.2s)]
*  realized how big this fucking venue is. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4270.88s)]
*  I think that's something that we always try to do on tour is either go into the shittiest [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4272.24s)]
*  seat and look down. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4277.12s)]
*  Because that puts a lot of perspective. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4278.12s)]
*  You're looking at that and you're like, whoa, somebody is so excited to sit right here. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4281.12s)]
*  I need to be so grateful that I even get to be on the fucking stage. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4284.32s)]
*  Yeah, literally. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4287.5199999999995s)]
*  And then it puts in perspective. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4288.5199999999995s)]
*  You're like, holy shit, I used to fucking work this shitty job or we were making funny [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4289.5199999999995s)]
*  jokes at a fucking chicken shop and now we're... [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4292.96s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4295.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4296.36s)]
*  Like this show started off on his sofa. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4297.36s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4299.36s)]
*  Five years ago. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4300.36s)]
*  Yeah, no studio, no nothing. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4301.36s)]
*  Like one DSLR camera that you have to redo every 20 minutes. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4302.36s)]
*  Every 20 minutes. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4306.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's got the video limit. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4307.16s)]
*  So we'd have to stop and start every 20 minutes. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4308.96s)]
*  Okay, are your parents finally more proud of you than your sister? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4310.76s)]
*  My dad is one of the biggest... [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4314.36s)]
*  I forgot the show. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4319.16s)]
*  He loves the show. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4320.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4321.16s)]
*  He was nearly in tears watching the live show. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4322.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4324.96s)]
*  And are they starting to get love? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4325.96s)]
*  Do people know your parents' characters? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4327.5199999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't say they know. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4329.08s)]
*  The people that I've seen my father before, like my close friends, things like that, they [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4330.48s)]
*  like, you know... [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4336.36s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4337.36s)]
*  But strangers... [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4338.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4339.36s)]
*  Because no one knows his face. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4340.36s)]
*  I don't put his face out there or anything like that. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4341.36s)]
*  Got it, got it, got it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4343.36s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4344.36s)]
*  There's Nigerian parents that are looking at their kids like, you know, Fuga is selling [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4345.36s)]
*  out the fucking... [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4348.639999999999s)]

*  I nicked my balls recently because I grabbed the wrong razor. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4379.24s)]
*  I thought it was a Manscaped. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4381.48s)]
*  Turns out it was a regular hair trimmer. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4382.48s)]

*  All right guys, we're gonna take a break real quick because we gotta talk about this bad [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4430.240000000001s)]
*  boy. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4433.280000000001s)]
*  Have you heard about it? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4434.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because the flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading alternative to [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4435.88s)]
*  vaping and smoking. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4438.96s)]
*  It's a whole new movement towards better habits led by these boys right here, Fume. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4440.36s)]
*  This is an award-winning flavored air device. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4446.2s)]
*  It's not like vaping. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4448.12s)]
*  If vaping was a sugary soda, this would be like an herbal tea. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4449.12s)]
*  They got tons of delicious flavors, crisp mint, orange vanilla. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4452.599999999999s)]
*  I personally like the vanilla probably because I'm fat. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4455.08s)]
*  But with flavored air, you can satisfy the oral fixation and you can pause or unpause [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4458.36s)]
*  or fast forward. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4462.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4463.2s)]
*  That is a thing that some of you guys have if you're addicted to vapes, whatever other [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4464.5199999999995s)]
*  products, oral fixation. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4468.2s)]
*  Right there, satisfied. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4470.16s)]
*  Also, I love that it's got a nice weight to it. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4471.16s)]
*  It's got this little clicky, fidgety thing right here as a person who just is incredibly [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4474.32s)]
*  fidgety. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4478.24s)]
*  I just love clicking. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4479.24s)]
*  There's no vapor. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4480.24s)]
*  You can use it anywhere. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4481.24s)]
*  And most importantly, there is no nicotine and it's not addictive. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4482.24s)]
*  Guys, it's not just me. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4484.28s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4538.6s)]
*  I can't remember what the context was. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4539.6s)]
*  But I call them bottom boys. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4541.6s)]
*  Long story short. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4544.68s)]
*  I can't remember what the context was. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4545.68s)]
*  I think we just discovered the term bottom boy. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4547.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4550.200000000001s)]
*  I think you were laughing about it for ages. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4551.2s)]
*  And it was in there somewhere. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4553.16s)]
*  Button boy. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4555.599999999999s)]
*  Bottom boy. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4556.599999999999s)]

*  I can't remember what the context was. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4565.599999999999s)]
*  My dad, I was speaking to my dad probably like a few weeks later and he was like, I [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4568.24s)]
*  was going through all the comments. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4571.76s)]
*  They said they want to stab you. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4572.76s)]
*  They want to kill you. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4573.76s)]
*  You shouldn't have said that. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4574.76s)]
*  I was like, don't read the comments, man. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4575.76s)]
*  Just breathe, bro. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4576.76s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4577.76s)]
*  He was so worried. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4578.76s)]
*  I was like, bro, it's fine. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4580.320000000001s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4583.320000000001s)]
*  Atlanta would piss down on that comment, bro. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4584.320000000001s)]
*  That was fucking funny. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4585.320000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4586.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4587.320000000001s)]
*  Nigerians are scared of gay guys. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4588.320000000001s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4589.320000000001s)]
*  They were like, yo, they're going to suck you or something. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4590.320000000001s)]
*  You got to be worried. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4593.320000000001s)]
*  But so I've heard Nigerians are also, I've not been to Nigerian in years, but I've also [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4594.320000000001s)]
*  heard in Nigerian there's a massive gay community, but it's more hidden than anything else. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4599.2s)]
*  Makes sense. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4603.16s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4604.16s)]
*  Damn. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4605.16s)]
*  But it's huge. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4606.16s)]
*  It's the gayest. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4607.16s)]
*  Would you say it's the gayest country in Africa? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4608.5599999999995s)]
*  I can't come out on that. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4611.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm just saying if we had to rank them. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4613.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4615.5599999999995s)]
*  You know what's so sweet? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4616.5599999999995s)]
*  He was really trying to help you out. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4617.5599999999995s)]
*  And then when he said that, he was like, that was good. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4619.5599999999995s)]
*  He was like, you're so good. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4621.5599999999995s)]
*  He was like, you're so good. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4623.5599999999995s)]
*  He was like, you're so good. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4625.5599999999995s)]
*  He was like, hey, you got this. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4627.5599999999995s)]
*  What is the gayest country in Africa? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4628.5599999999995s)]
*  We should look into that. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4630.5599999999995s)]
*  South Africa? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4632.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4633.5599999999995s)]
*  Probably America, right? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4634.5599999999995s)]
*  In Africa! [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4635.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4636.5599999999995s)]
*  America though, right? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4637.96s)]
*  If you say South Africa, that's safe. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4638.96s)]
*  Why? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4640.96s)]
*  Because it's the whites, dude. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4641.96s)]
*  They just put everything on the whites. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4643.96s)]
*  Oh, it is actually South Africa according to Google. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4645.96s)]
*  They have the largest percentage of gays. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4647.96s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4649.96s)]
*  The Dutch are kind of gay. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4650.96s)]
*  I feel like they invented it. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4652.96s)]
*  They were the most progressive culture in Europe at the time. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4657.96s)]
*  Still now. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4662.96s)]
*  Even now. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4663.96s)]
*  What I'm saying is even back then, they're like, oh, we shouldn't have any [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4664.96s)]
*  laws and all the drugs are legal and we need to accept everybody, etc. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4667.48s)]
*  So if you just take that and extrapolate it to wherever they've landed, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4671.48s)]
*  it's probably going to be pretty fucking gay. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4675.48s)]
*  Y'all ever did the Red Light District in Amsterdam? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4678.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4680.48s)]
*  Have you guys paid? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4681.48s)]
*  No, never paid. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4682.48s)]
*  This song's terrifying, bro. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4684.48s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4686.48s)]
*  I just heard horror stories. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4687.48s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4689.48s)]
*  It's such bullshit. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4690.48s)]
*  No, bro. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4691.48s)]
*  I'm being deadly serious. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4692.48s)]
*  You hooked up with the college whore. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4693.48s)]
*  She wanted me, bro. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4697.48s)]
*  She desired me. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4698.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4700.48s)]
*  She wants money. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4701.48s)]
*  That's how I feel in strip clubs. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4702.48s)]
*  I'm like, man, you'll do this for anybody. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4704.48s)]
*  I feel that. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4706.48s)]
*  I feel that. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4708.48s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4709.48s)]
*  But there's a little part of you that there's a little challenge. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4710.48s)]
*  What if I can win her over? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4712.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of our boys. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4714.48s)]
*  He likes to save strippers. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4715.48s)]
*  He likes to save them. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4716.48s)]
*  Like, sit him down. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4718.48s)]
*  You don't need to do this. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4719.48s)]
*  I'll be honest, bro. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4721.48s)]
*  I'll be doing that shit. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4722.48s)]
*  That's your bag. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4723.48s)]
*  I do that a little bit. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4724.48s)]
*  It is fucked up. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4725.48s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4726.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4729.48s)]
*  Maybe I feel uncomfortable with the nature of the relationship, like the transactional. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4730.48s)]
*  So I have to make it like this real thing, but it's not real. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4734.48s)]
*  I'm being just as phony, but instead of payment of dollars, it's emotional payment. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4739.48s)]
*  But it's still phony. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4744.48s)]
*  And the dollar is so much easier. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4746.48s)]
*  I should just do the easy. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4748.48s)]
*  Would you feel better if you had that safe safe into a strip club? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4749.48s)]
*  I like where your brain is going, by the way. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4753.48s)]
*  And then you did the Prince Charming thing. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4755.48s)]
*  Okay, Prince Charming is trying to connect with them. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4757.48s)]
*  You don't need to do this. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4760.48s)]
*  Then she asked you for a dance. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4761.48s)]
*  Would you feel way better to go for the dance? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4763.48s)]
*  Even if you have to pay the dollar? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4765.48s)]
*  Is she paying for it or am I paying? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4766.48s)]
*  You still have to pay for it. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4767.48s)]
*  But she's making you believe if I didn't have to take this, I wouldn't take it. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4768.48s)]
*  If she just gave me the dance out of the kindness of her heart, I would feel like I was shoplifting. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4771.48s)]
*  She came there to rinse you. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4778.48s)]
*  You rinsed her. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4779.48s)]
*  Shoplifting is crazy. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4780.48s)]
*  That might be a highest level game. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4781.48s)]
*  You get the free dance. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4782.48s)]
*  Free dance. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4783.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4784.48s)]
*  I don't know if I have that kind of game. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4785.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's game. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4786.48s)]
*  But that is, I mean, there are some, they gotta get horny too. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4787.48s)]
*  Of course, bro. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4790.48s)]
*  They're human beings, bro. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4791.48s)]
*  They're probably. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4792.48s)]
*  They're not setting though. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4793.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4794.48s)]
*  I'm not setting. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4795.48s)]
*  That's work. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4796.48s)]
*  Are they desensitized to, you know, they're not feeling it. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4797.48s)]
*  They're not feeling it. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4800.48s)]
*  They're not feeling it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4801.48s)]
*  They're not feeling it. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4802.48s)]
*  They're not feeling it. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4803.48s)]
*  They're not feeling it. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4804.48s)]
*  They're not feeling it. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4805.48s)]
*  Are they desensitized to sex or are they desensitized to just the lap dancing type [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4806.48s)]
*  of shit? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4813.12s)]
*  Probably both. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4814.12s)]
*  Probably. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4815.12s)]
*  I would say the lap dance more than sex. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4816.12s)]
*  More than. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4817.12s)]
*  In my opinion. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4818.12s)]
*  I would say a little. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4819.12s)]
*  Here's why I agree with you, because like there are people that, they're like, my parents [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4820.12s)]
*  had a dance studio and like dancing maybe to us, they would teach dance lessons as we're [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4823.5199999999995s)]
*  growing up. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4827.44s)]
*  Dancing to us might be a more intimate thing. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4828.44s)]
*  Oh, for sure, bro. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4829.44s)]
*  Like I saw someone dance with my girl. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4830.44s)]
*  I'd be like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4831.44s)]
*  But to my parents, like partner dancing was just their life and it was just, there was [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4832.44s)]
*  nothing sexual about it. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4835.72s)]
*  So I wonder if they do that. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4837.04s)]
*  I know it sounds crazy, but with the lap dances. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4838.04s)]
*  I reckon they have no sexual connection with lap dancers whatsoever. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4841.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4845.64s)]
*  Like whatsoever. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4846.64s)]
*  It's just. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4847.64s)]
*  But what if they feel it? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4848.64s)]
*  What if they feel his shit? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4849.64s)]
*  Oh, his shit? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4850.64s)]
*  If they feel his shit, they gotta ace it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4851.64s)]
*  Sounds like they're full of fear, bro. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4852.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a threat. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4853.64s)]
*  That's a baton. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4854.64s)]
*  There's a copper in here. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4855.64s)]
*  We've got an undercover. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4856.64s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4857.64s)]
*  Maybe wearing them Nike Tech suits. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4858.64s)]
*  Like you can't even wear it. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4859.64s)]
*  That's genius, bro. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4860.64s)]
*  When you come into the strip club with the bike shorts, can you guys do that legally? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4861.64s)]
*  Legally. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4865.64s)]
*  Like do they have a tire you have to wear at strip clubs? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4866.64s)]
*  I don't know, but I don't think I've ever gone to a strip club in shorts. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4869.64s)]
*  No, they do. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4873.64s)]
*  I think they do. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4874.64s)]
*  Truly like a club. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4875.64s)]
*  True. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4876.64s)]
*  How do you wear a strip club in a club? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4877.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4878.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4879.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4880.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4881.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4882.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4883.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4884.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4885.64s)]
*  How do you tip them? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4886.64s)]
*  Just because your denominations are... [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4888.88s)]
*  Strip clubs in the, well, I would say London, are very different to obviously America. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4893.02s)]
*  Whereas in America, you can either, obviously if you've got the pole, you can either give [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4897.76s)]
*  them money or you go for a private dance and give them money. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4900.92s)]
*  Whereas in the UK, there's like a stage where they all dance and the lady comes around with [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4902.92s)]
*  a fucking pot and you have to like put money in. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4907.52s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4909.56s)]
*  To watch. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4910.56s)]
*  To watch. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4911.56s)]
*  It's a kip bucket. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4912.56s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4913.56s)]
*  What if you don't like the dance? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4914.56s)]
*  This is socialism. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4916.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4917.4800000000005s)]
*  This is the problem with socialism. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not merit based. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4920.160000000001s)]
*  There's a girl that's not working for it in a way that you like, but you still have to [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4921.160000000001s)]
*  give her the same amount of money as the girl you really like. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4926.52s)]
*  Yeah bro. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4929.080000000001s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4930.080000000001s)]
*  And you tip down on the girl you really like because you got to save money for the girl [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4931.080000000001s)]
*  who sucks. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4934.6s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4935.6s)]
*  Strip clubs and take them off for a lat dance and just stay in there, right? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4936.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4939.6s)]
*  You can do that afterwards. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4940.6s)]
*  That's like the main... [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4941.6s)]
*  That's what everyone's doing. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4942.6s)]
*  When you walk in, that's the general consensus. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4943.64s)]
*  There's a pole. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4945.64s)]
*  So nobody's making it rain. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4946.64s)]
*  Nah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4947.64s)]
*  It rains all the time, bro. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4948.64s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4949.64s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4950.64s)]
*  Our denomination is five pounds. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4951.64s)]
*  You don't have a dog. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4952.64s)]
*  The only thing we have is a five, so. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4953.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great dance. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4956.64s)]
*  Like you're giving a fiver to somebody. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4957.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's consistent. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4958.64s)]
*  It's not that level of freshness. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4959.64s)]
*  It's better. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4960.64s)]
*  Okay, do you guys have girls that like... because you guys are kind of out there a little [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4961.64s)]
*  bit, you're telling like sex stories and that kind of stuff sometimes, I imagine. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4966.64s)]
*  Do you have girls that were like, they kind of fetishize that and they're like, I want [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4969.68s)]
*  to be in one of their stories. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4973.68s)]
*  I want them to talk about me on the pot. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4974.68s)]
*  Go on. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4977.68s)]
*  I don't know about... [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4978.68s)]
*  Do you want a reference in... [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4979.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4980.68s)]
*  I don't know about anyone who's ever said, thought, I want to be in the story, but we [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4981.68s)]
*  definitely will make references. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4986.68s)]
*  Like recently we made a reference like, it's sexy if a girl was to ask you what colour [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4987.68s)]
*  show I do my nails. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4992.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4993.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4994.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4995.68s)]
*  If a girl was to ask you what colour show I do my nails, that's sexy. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=4996.72s)]
*  Till now I get DMs every day. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5000.72s)]
*  What colour show I do my nails? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5002.72s)]
*  What colour show I do my nails? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5003.72s)]
*  What colour show I do my nails? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5004.72s)]
*  What colour show I do my nails? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5005.72s)]
*  So shit like that that will reference like, it's hot if a girl does this, it's hot if [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5006.72s)]
*  a girl does that, then DMs. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5009.72s)]
*  Because that's our honest answer. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5010.72s)]
*  We're not even trying to show by anything. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5011.72s)]
*  This is genuine. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5013.72s)]
*  And because you're being genuine about it, those girls are using that as like a cheeky [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5014.72s)]
*  excuse to interact. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5018.72s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5019.72s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5020.72s)]
*  But there must be pressure performed now. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5021.72s)]
*  Like if you hook up with a girl, it's like, you know, they know. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5023.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5025.76s)]
*  They know that I'm... [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5026.76s)]
*  You've talked up your dick. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5027.76s)]
*  I've not talked up my dick. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5028.76s)]
*  I just said what the truth is. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5029.76s)]
*  There is... [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5031.76s)]
*  But like, they want to be the toilet bad. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5032.76s)]
*  I'll be intrigued now if a girl saw your dick and she was like, nah bro. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5035.76s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5039.76s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5040.76s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5041.76s)]
*  You're talking about now. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5042.76s)]
*  Get out of the fucking toilet and prove it, bro. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5043.76s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5044.76s)]
*  You're not sitting all the way back, bitch. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5045.76s)]
*  You're not a tariff. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5046.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're a fucking liar. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5047.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5048.76s)]
*  You're not a tariff. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5049.76s)]
*  You're not a tariff. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5050.76s)]
*  You're not a tariff. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5051.76s)]
*  That's true. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5052.8s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5053.8s)]
*  You could undersell and over deliver. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5054.8s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5056.8s)]
*  He's like, nah. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5057.8s)]
*  I just speak facts, man. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5058.8s)]
*  You just speak facts. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5059.8s)]
*  That was a recent clip though. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5060.8s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5061.8s)]
*  That was pretty recent, yeah. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5062.8s)]
*  Are there any girls in the comments that are like, yo, I seen it. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5063.8s)]
*  I don't read comments, so I don't know. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5066.8s)]
*  That's a lie. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5068.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5069.8s)]
*  That would be tough. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5070.8s)]
*  That would be tough. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5071.8s)]
*  He will read that comment though. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5072.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5073.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5074.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5075.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5076.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5077.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5078.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5079.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5080.8s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5081.84s)]
*  Fucking liar. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5083.84s)]
*  You gotta get the fence to realize. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5084.84s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5087.84s)]
*  So a friend of mine lived in, he might be here right now, he lived in England. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5089.84s)]
*  He was working in an advertising agency that had an office over there as well. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5094.28s)]
*  You know, sometimes you guys can work here, we work there, these global companies, whatever. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5097.96s)]
*  And he said an interesting thing about British women. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5101.52s)]
*  He said, when you're out partying with them, they're down and they're ready to go that [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5104.400000000001s)]
*  night. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5110.8s)]
*  But sometimes after that night, the follow through might be they're a little bit more [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5112.4800000000005s)]
*  prudish. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5118.08s)]
*  100%. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5119.08s)]
*  If you don't close that night, it's harder. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5120.08s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5122.400000000001s)]
*  And can you guys explain that phenomenon? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5123.400000000001s)]
*  Isn't that, I feel like that's a generic thing. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5124.88s)]
*  Or is it not? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5128.0s)]
*  American girls, people, drugs. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5129.0s)]
*  So you're talking about if you manage to hit or no? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5130.0s)]
*  If you don't manage to hit the first night, it's harder to hit going forward. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5132.56s)]
*  It might not even be a connection after that. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5136.56s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5138.6s)]
*  And explain that phenomenon. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5140.280000000001s)]
*  That's more to do with like, beer goggle stuff. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5142.160000000001s)]
*  So like, and also the culture is also like, I'm outside, I'm outside, I see you girls, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5146.6s)]
*  see you girls, I'm outside. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5150.76s)]
*  So if like they want to envelop in that moment, it's like, wow, fuck, I'm meeting this guy, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5151.96s)]
*  this is crazy. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5156.88s)]
*  We're partying, everything's good. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5157.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm ready to suck his dick in the toilet. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5158.88s)]
*  I don't care, like whatever. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5160.88s)]
*  But the next day, I'm refined and I have a job and I shouldn't be behaving this way. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5161.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5167.160000000001s)]
*  You're not yet. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5168.160000000001s)]
*  You're not taking the next day like, yeah, what's going on? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5169.16s)]
*  What the fuck, bro? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5171.84s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5172.84s)]
*  Yeah, you missed your chance. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5173.84s)]
*  You have to start from. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5174.84s)]
*  Oh, so if you do like a girl, would you say it's better to prolong it or would you say [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5175.84s)]
*  it's better to hit first night and then continue? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5181.599999999999s)]
*  Hit first night, in my opinion. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5184.32s)]
*  Hit first night. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5185.32s)]
*  Yeah, hit first night. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5186.32s)]
*  That is unique. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5187.32s)]
*  That's not. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5188.32s)]
*  Here it would be the opposite. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5189.32s)]
*  It's almost like a sign that you really like the girl. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5190.32s)]
*  If you're like, nah, let's chill out on this. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5191.96s)]
*  I want to hang out with you. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5193.48s)]
*  And they would see that as a compliment. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5194.8s)]
*  And they go, oh, he really likes me. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5195.8s)]
*  If you agreed, they'd still see it as a compliment. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5197.4s)]
*  But also it's like there's a slight undertone of like, bro, I just offered you sex and you're [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5200.44s)]
*  saying no. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5206.5199999999995s)]
*  So now it's a rejection. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5207.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5208.5199999999995s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5209.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm doing something that is like maybe culturally frowned upon and I went there with [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5210.5199999999995s)]
*  you and you rejected it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5213.759999999999s)]
*  Now I'm embarrassed. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5214.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5215.759999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5216.759999999999s)]
*  So it's like it almost in a weird way, like breeds this one night stand culture. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5217.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5223.28s)]
*  And also they feel that compliment that you're saying in terms of like, oh, he must really [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5224.28s)]
*  like me because he's offering to slow things down and take me out. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5227.12s)]
*  They would feel that is if they gave you the one night stand and then you message them [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5230.360000000001s)]
*  the next day to see them again, then they're like, wow, he really likes me. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5234.02s)]
*  So sex the first night is in no way like indicative of the girl being easy. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5237.6s)]
*  It is. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5242.320000000001s)]
*  It's a great area. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5243.320000000001s)]
*  But she's already taken that leap. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5244.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5245.320000000001s)]
*  I'm saying like not all girls in the UK are ready for one night stands. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5246.320000000001s)]
*  That's not the case at all. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5247.92s)]
*  But if we are talking about a girl that is willing to do that. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5248.92s)]
*  Then you got to go. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5251.68s)]
*  Then you have to go. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5252.68s)]
*  And then again, if you see her again and see her again, then again, she's like, wow, he [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5253.84s)]
*  likes me more than I thought. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5257.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5259.52s)]
*  100%. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5260.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5261.52s)]
*  And would you guys, if you were really into a girl that first night, would you guys go [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5262.52s)]
*  for it? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5265.28s)]
*  100%. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5266.28s)]
*  Got it. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5267.28s)]
*  And would you hold any feelings like, oh, she's easy. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5268.28s)]
*  She just let me hit the first night. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5270.56s)]
*  I'm not marrying a girl who I fucked on the first night. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5271.56s)]
*  Got it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5273.320000000001s)]
*  No, it's the thing. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5274.320000000001s)]
*  I feel like it depends personally if I'm, if we're both in the moment, both in the zone [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5279.04s)]
*  and I think she's banging, she thinks I'm banging and we fucking the first night and [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5283.72s)]
*  post that everything is amazing. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5287.28s)]
*  Conversation, sex, energy, chemistry. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5289.72s)]
*  If we start today, fucking why not? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5292.16s)]
*  I couldn't care less. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5295.56s)]
*  You wouldn't, you wouldn't, there's no taboo or anything like that on it. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5296.56s)]
*  Couldn't care less. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5299.44s)]
*  Yeah, why wouldn't you? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5300.44s)]
*  When I say fucking the first night, it depends. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5301.44s)]
*  If I met a girl for a date and we went out on a date and I fucked her on the first date, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5304.68s)]
*  I would still marry that girl. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5309.88s)]
*  That's different than if you just met a girl. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5311.4400000000005s)]
*  If I met a girl in a club. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5312.4400000000005s)]
*  You bang her out of the bathroom. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5313.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, took her to an alleyway and fucked her. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5314.4400000000005s)]
*  That's heinous. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5317.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's different. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5318.4400000000005s)]
*  That's heinous. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5319.4400000000005s)]
*  Hey, heinous is a great word. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5320.4400000000005s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5321.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I go out and meet in a club and fuck that night, it's just never going to be my [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5322.4400000000005s)]
*  wife. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5329.4400000000005s)]
*  Never going to be my wife. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5330.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard about this, that like American women are charmed by the British [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5332.2s)]
*  accent. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5336.0s)]
*  I've heard of it. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5337.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's necessarily the accent, by the way. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5338.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's just the sound of it. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5340.04s)]
*  I think it might be they're charmed by... [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5341.4s)]
*  Is it how we speak to them in general? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5345.719999999999s)]
*  There is like when you guys are not on your like Geordie Shore shit, but like when you're [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5348.04s)]
*  on your like refined British shit, I think it reminds them of like films they've seen [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5352.679999999999s)]
*  and elegance to British culture, which is seductive. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5357.879999999999s)]
*  The game is just so different. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5360.84s)]
*  Explain. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5362.84s)]
*  In my opinion, I feel like when I've spoken to American women, the term is, oh, we love [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5363.84s)]
*  your accent. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5369.68s)]
*  And I think it's vice versa. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5370.68s)]
*  I love their accent. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5371.68s)]
*  But go on, go on, go on. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5372.68s)]
*  But I think it's more so of... [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5373.68s)]
*  They're not loving an accent, like, oh, right. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5375.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it's more so the approach is what I feel like. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5378.68s)]
*  Maybe they're so used to one way, the American way or whatever. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5382.4400000000005s)]
*  They see something different, they hear something different, the approach is different. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5385.280000000001s)]
*  So they're like, oh, I like this. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5388.72s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5390.04s)]
*  There's a charm to it. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5391.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5392.04s)]
*  It's a novelty to it. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5393.04s)]
*  So maybe that's why they're attracted to the British accent. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5394.04s)]
*  I remember going to England and then my homie was like, dude, girls love the British accent, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5395.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean the American accent here. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5399.160000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5400.160000000001s)]
*  And then he and I started getting closer over the next three days. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5402.64s)]
*  We're chopping it up somewhere, Birmingham, Leicester, whatever. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5404.72s)]
*  These three girls turned around and were like, are you American? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5407.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, Hawaii. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5409.64s)]
*  They started laughing. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5410.64s)]
*  I was like, the accent's making it. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5411.64s)]
*  They were like, no, we quite like it. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5413.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck is that? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5414.0s)]
*  Oh, do British girls like the American accent? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5415.0s)]
*  That's a culture. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5417.2s)]
*  That's a culture. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5418.2s)]
*  That's a potentially taboo. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5419.2s)]
*  No, not taboo. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5421.0s)]
*  It's like some women find it corny. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5422.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5424.32s)]
*  And then some women like it. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5425.32s)]
*  I think I don't know a black girl in London who finds the American accent sexy. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5426.84s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5432.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5433.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5435.5199999999995s)]
*  I actually don't know. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5436.5199999999995s)]
*  I've only heard that they think it's corny. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5437.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5438.96s)]
*  So black British women think the American accent is unattractive. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5439.96s)]
*  I don't want to speak for all black British women, but from what I've heard, from what [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5447.32s)]
*  I've heard, yeah, they're just like, yeah, I've got that. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5450.599999999999s)]
*  From this episode, we are the British opinion on a lot of shit that we are not qualified [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5454.2s)]
*  to. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5461.799999999999s)]
*  You're speaking for the crown. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5462.799999999999s)]
*  I think, yeah, I do think like a lot of, well, for one, the American approach is corny to [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5465.12s)]
*  black British women. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5472.759999999999s)]
*  Explain. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5473.759999999999s)]
*  We do a lot of like, we have a REACT channel, right? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5475.2s)]
*  On YouTube. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5477.320000000001s)]
*  And we've done a lot of it in terms of like American riz or whatever like that. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5478.320000000001s)]
*  And like American guys, there's a massive culture that you guys have here where you [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5482.24s)]
*  can just approach a girl in the street and be like, what's your name? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5485.0s)]
*  And all that kind of stuff. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5488.400000000001s)]
*  Like if you did that in London, immediately like God is up and it's just like, what the [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5489.400000000001s)]
*  fuck do you want? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5494.52s)]
*  Americans are more friendly. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5495.68s)]
*  Way more friendly. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5496.68s)]
*  And more accepting to bullshit. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5497.68s)]
*  Yeah, accepting to bullshit is the fucking word. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5498.68s)]
*  That's an interesting observation. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5500.8s)]
*  You mean that we will go along with small talk or pleasantries in a way that you guys [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5502.64s)]
*  won't? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5506.6s)]
*  Yeah, we have no tolerance for it. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5507.6s)]
*  Real quick, do you find that is something that is like ubiquitous across America? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5509.92s)]
*  Because I feel like in New York, we're not big fans of small talk simply because it's [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5516.0s)]
*  an urban environment where you've got to see a lot of people. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5520.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, I don't got all this time to talk about the weather. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5522.96s)]
*  Like we got to go. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5525.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5526.200000000001s)]
*  Which might be more similar to London. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5527.200000000001s)]
*  Not 100%. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5528.200000000001s)]
*  Valid. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5529.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5530.200000000001s)]
*  And it starts car culture where talking to somebody might be the first person you spoke [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5531.2s)]
*  to all day. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5534.76s)]
*  So it's like, all right, I'm going to be nice to you. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5535.76s)]
*  I'm going to get all the energy. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5536.76s)]
*  Yeah, I want some human interaction. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5537.76s)]
*  So they're a little shocked by our pleasantries and our maybe positivity and they don't trust [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5540.36s)]
*  it as authentic. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5545.679999999999s)]
*  You're selling something. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5546.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5547.679999999999s)]

*  What do you want and get to the point? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5549.679999999999s)]
*  So they would rather the upfront approach about, hey, I think you're beautiful or whatever [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5551.84s)]
*  the fuck it is. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5555.84s)]

*  Right. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5574.12s)]
*  And then we can work backwards from there. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5575.12s)]
*  Like if she, if she, if she entertains the bullet points, then we can introduce pleasantries. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5576.4s)]
*  And now let's just be charming. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5581.5199999999995s)]

*  Oh, so they feel like that uncertainty they don't like and they'll remove themselves from [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5587.5599999999995s)]

*  It makes you less trustworthy. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5595.04s)]
*  You're putting your intentions on the table. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5596.04s)]
*  And then we can get to charm. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5598.32s)]
*  And we have to disarm the thing with the pleasantries. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5599.639999999999s)]

*  It's almost like it is inauthentic in a way, but it's almost like we have to find a different [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5611.28s)]
*  reason to talk and then they have to almost win us over. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5616.32s)]

*  you're putting it right on the table. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5668.72s)]
*  If a handsome fucking tall, strong guy walks up, puts it around the table, you might get [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5669.8s)]
*  some reaction. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5673.56s)]
*  But if a guy who's not traditionally handsome, but might be like really smart, charming, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5674.56s)]
*  he can find his way in. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5678.860000000001s)]

*  wouldn't say have to. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5725.44s)]
*  I think there are many different ways to approach, but honestly not laying it all on the table [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5726.88s)]
*  might be the more effective way. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5730.88s)]
*  Yeah, I get that. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5732.88s)]

*  not very friendly. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5745.400000000001s)]
*  It is a British thing. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5746.400000000001s)]
*  You're a little reserved. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5747.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we don't. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5748.400000000001s)]

*  Like why put on that? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5771.32s)]

*  That's interesting. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5816.4800000000005s)]
*  We love a kid going up and talking. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5817.4800000000005s)]
*  We think it's cute, but it's very much like, you're bothering, just leave them alone. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5818.4800000000005s)]
*  I had my wife's stepfather, when she was a kid, would have her, like let's say they were [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5820.72s)]
*  out to dinner, she would have to walk up to six different people and ask them a question [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5830.52s)]
*  that did not have a yes or no answer. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5835.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5837.240000000001s)]
*  To build up her, you know, social skills and like reduce any kind of anxiety about socializing, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5838.240000000001s)]
*  which would be like so taboo, I imagine based on what you guys are saying. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5844.64s)]
*  That wouldn't happen in the UK. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5847.6s)]
*  If a kid came up to me and was like, sorry, my mom's making me arse, I'm like what the [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5849.6s)]
*  fuck? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5853.200000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about bro? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5854.200000000001s)]
*  What the fuck man? [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5855.200000000001s)]
*  It's funny that you said it, it seems like it's almost inconsiderate to inconvenience [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5856.200000000001s)]
*  the street. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5859.96s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5860.96s)]
*  So it's a respect thing. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5861.96s)]
*  It's like, I also feel like it depends on when you're, it depends on where you're raised [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5862.96s)]
*  slash born. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5866.84s)]
*  Like you said, there are places in America where like New York, for example, very fast [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5867.84s)]
*  London again, very, very fast pace, massive community, but very fast pace. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5872.8s)]
*  So people don't like to waste other people's time. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5876.68s)]
*  That's my so if you're born and bred, like, I don't know, somewhere up north, for example, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5879.4400000000005s)]
*  Sheffield, Sheffield, I was gonna say Sheffield. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5884.4400000000005s)]
*  You could be a bit more friendly. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5886.4400000000005s)]
*  You get a bit more as they feel and it's just chill. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5888.92s)]
*  Y'all are going to Dallas tomorrow. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5891.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's changed a little bit, but it's very, you see someone walking on the street. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5892.68s)]
*  Hey, how are you? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5896.96s)]
*  You can wave, you say hi. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5897.96s)]
*  That's just what you do. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5898.96s)]
*  If somebody doesn't do that, who the fuck is that guy? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5900.04s)]
*  I just walked by, made eye contact. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5902.56s)]
*  It's almost rude to not engage. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5904.4s)]
*  Because there's less business, I would tell him, I thought New Yorkers were rude. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5906.52s)]
*  It's just there's so many people. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5909.56s)]
*  I don't have time to be friendly. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5910.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5911.84s)]
*  Like in Texas, if I hold the door open for one person, one person is going to walk through [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5912.84s)]
*  that door, maybe two. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5915.64s)]
*  In New York, if I hold the door open at Times Square, I'm never going to close. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5916.64s)]
*  You're never going to leave. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5920.28s)]
*  So I think London is a might be a little bit more like that. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5921.28s)]
*  And I was curious, are they much friendlier? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5923.96s)]
*  Because you'll see 180 degree difference when you go down south. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5926.44s)]
*  You're not going to see 180 in England. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5929.84s)]
*  In England, no you won't. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5932.8s)]
*  There's nowhere in England you're going to see a complete shift. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5933.8s)]
*  Unless we're talking about like villages. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5935.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5937.6s)]
*  For the most part, it is always like, don't bother people, let them get on, don't inconvenience [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5938.6s)]
*  them. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5944.4400000000005s)]
*  And nine times out of ten, if you're in London, everyone's got their headphones on anyway. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5945.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they'll find reasons not to make that happen. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5947.76s)]
*  I stay in a lot because I don't live in London. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5949.92s)]
*  So I stay in a... [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5952.0s)]
*  Do you mind sharing where you live? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5953.0s)]
*  I live in a town called Northampton, it's like two hours outside of London. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5954.2s)]
*  So like half the week I'll stay in hotels. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5957.08s)]
*  And like the one hotel. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5959.84s)]
*  So you can do the pod? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5960.84s)]
*  Yeah, because it's two days in London. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5961.84s)]
*  So you'll travel to London, stay there for three or four days to do the pod and then [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5963.72s)]
*  you go back. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5968.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5969.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5970.92s)]
*  And you would never want to move to London? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5971.92s)]
*  I thought about it loads of times, but no. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5973.56s)]
*  Really? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5975.6s)]
*  I prefer the situation I have now. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5976.6s)]
*  I prefer it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5977.6s)]
*  It's just like you like the quiet being outside. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5978.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5980.0s)]
*  Like a house. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5981.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have like a nice house, it's quiet and like chill. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5982.0s)]
*  It's just like very pleasant where I live. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5985.96s)]
*  Got it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5988.32s)]
*  And there's also the town I was raised in. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5989.32s)]
*  So my mom lives there. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5990.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, so you got community there the whole thing. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5991.4800000000005s)]
*  And then you, you're just a fuck. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5993.16s)]
*  Born and bred London. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5994.16s)]
*  So you're just getting after me. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5995.16s)]
*  Oh God, what a terror. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5996.16s)]
*  This guy is a terror. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5997.16s)]
*  What do you think is the farthest you've ever driven to smash a ting? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=5998.16s)]
*  Smash a ting, you know. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6005.52s)]
*  Like the largest distance you've had to cross just for... [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6006.52s)]
*  Trains work too. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6009.72s)]
*  We'll cop trains and planes in a couple hours. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6010.72s)]
*  I've never traveled far. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6012.8s)]
*  We have like a, we have a rule that if, if you're, if you're gonna go and travel to [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6013.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6057.400000000001s)]
*  But it also was like a long buildup. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6058.400000000001s)]
*  What country? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6061.04s)]
*  Now I want to know. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6062.04s)]

*  Why Paris? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6064.04s)]
*  Two hours. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6065.04s)]
*  Paris is like an hour. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6066.04s)]
*  Oh, to be fair, it was an hour. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6067.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was an hour. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6068.04s)]
*  It's not Paris, but it was an hour. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6069.04s)]
*  What country? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6070.04s)]

*  It was Amsterdam. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6085.36s)]
*  Okay, I was close enough. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6086.36s)]
*  That's two hours? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6087.36s)]
*  No, it's 45 minutes. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6088.36s)]
*  I want a map. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6089.36s)]
*  Because you flew? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6090.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6091.36s)]
*  It's the Dutch. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6092.36s)]
*  Did you fly? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6093.36s)]
*  Yeah, I flew. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6094.36s)]
*  You flew. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6095.36s)]
*  That's different. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6096.36s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't drive. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6097.36s)]
*  I thought we were talking about driving. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6098.36s)]
*  Okay, so the Dutch. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6099.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6100.36s)]
*  Okay, so and then it was just a freaky girl or what? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6101.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6104.639999999999s)]
*  It was one of those ones, like I said, it was built up for so long. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6105.639999999999s)]
*  Like we were talking, conversation, blah, blah, blah. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6107.88s)]
*  Did she do that European thing where they like just shave up to the knee? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6109.759999999999s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6112.599999999999s)]
*  Is that a thing? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6113.599999999999s)]
*  You've never seen the European girls that do that? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6114.599999999999s)]
*  No, bro. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6116.599999999999s)]
*  They shave up to the knee. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6117.599999999999s)]
*  And they just let this hair grow. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6118.599999999999s)]
*  Can I just say something? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6120.599999999999s)]
*  You've got anecdotes, bro. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6121.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6122.599999999999s)]
*  I've lived the life. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6123.599999999999s)]
*  You've got anecdotes, bro. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6124.599999999999s)]
*  I've lived the life, gentlemen. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6125.599999999999s)]
*  What the fuck, bro? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6126.599999999999s)]
*  You guys have never seen that where they shave up to the knee? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6127.599999999999s)]
*  That would scare the life out of you. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6130.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6131.84s)]
*  I've never seen that. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6132.84s)]
*  And I've taken out a few over there. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6133.84s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6138.84s)]
*  I've never seen that, bro. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6139.84s)]
*  Yo, is it just me? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6140.84s)]
*  I think I saw it, bro. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6141.84s)]
*  Did I find the one that was angry looking? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6142.84s)]
*  Yeah, you found a hairy thing and she was like, oh, it's just what we do. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6143.84s)]
*  And you took that around with it, yeah. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6146.84s)]
*  I thought this was like a Brit, not a British thing, like a European thing, shave up to [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6149.84s)]
*  the knee. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6154.84s)]
*  Never heard of that. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6155.84s)]
*  Never heard it, never seen it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6156.84s)]
*  Sorry, bro. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6157.84s)]
*  Do they keep it hairy out there? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6158.84s)]
*  I don't necessarily think it's a country thing. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6160.08s)]
*  In America, it's not. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6162.08s)]
*  I've never slept with a girl with a lot of pubic hair. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6164.08s)]
*  With a lot? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6168.58s)]
*  More than like a land issue type of thing. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6169.58s)]
*  I've gone in between shaves. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6172.58s)]
*  But not like an intentional growth. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6174.58s)]
*  Intentional growth is crazy. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6178.58s)]
*  But that's not. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6180.58s)]
*  She had a little Luther going on down there. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6181.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6184.58s)]
*  Fucking hell. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6186.58s)]
*  Have you all ever been in a fight for each other? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6190.58s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6192.58s)]
*  Has some shit ever broken out like at a pub or something? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6193.58s)]
*  You would step in and like bang. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6195.58s)]
*  For each other? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6197.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6198.58s)]
*  Or just fight in general. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6199.58s)]
*  For each other? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6200.58s)]
*  Oh. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6201.58s)]
*  No, with each other. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6202.58s)]
*  Why wasn't it for each other though? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6203.58s)]
*  It was for you. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6204.58s)]
*  It was for you. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6205.58s)]
*  It was for each other. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6206.58s)]
*  Okay, I understand what you're saying, but the question is very different by the way [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6209.58s)]
*  you're saying. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6213.58s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6214.58s)]
*  I'll explain. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6215.58s)]
*  Did you see how diplomatically he got out of that bullshit right there? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6217.32s)]
*  Okay, the question was different, but I understand your perspective. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6222.32s)]
*  I'll continue. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6225.32s)]
*  That's just how my brain works, bro. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6226.32s)]
*  So there was a time in Birmingham, we were in probably like our second year of uni. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6229.32s)]
*  So this is the way I took it, like 2010. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6234.32s)]
*  Myself and one of our other friends, Toby, were on the dance floor and there was a chick [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6237.32s)]
*  looking good and squeezed a bit of bottom flesh. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6242.0599999999995s)]
*  And the guy, I don't know if it was her man or whatever, but the guy was saying stuff [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6247.0599999999995s)]
*  to us. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6252.0599999999995s)]
*  It was her man. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6253.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, but it was her man. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6254.0599999999995s)]
*  He's so undeniable. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6255.0599999999995s)]
*  He's so undeniable. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6256.0599999999995s)]
*  Let me laugh. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6257.0599999999995s)]
*  The guy was saying stuff to us and I was like, obviously the music, I was like, I can't [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6258.0599999999995s)]
*  hear you. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6264.0599999999995s)]
*  I was simulating like I can't hear you. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6265.0599999999995s)]
*  In my mind, in his head, he thought, are you dumb? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6266.0599999999995s)]
*  Are you stupid? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6269.0599999999995s)]
*  I can't hear what you're saying. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6270.8s)]
*  And it got a bit rowdy, started pushing, pushing, pushing back. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6272.8s)]
*  It's funny you think that's what escalated the fight and now you grab it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6275.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6278.8s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6279.8s)]
*  It obviously was his girl throwing her ass in your face. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6280.8s)]
*  Obviously. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6284.8s)]
*  It's a girl's fault. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6285.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6286.8s)]
*  And then it just got a bit handsy. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6287.8s)]
*  And then what happened? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6288.8s)]
*  Y'all fucked him up? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6289.8s)]
*  Nah, he was a big motherfucker. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6290.8s)]
*  What happened was this son of a bitch and Toby took a side pass so the rest of us could [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6293.8s)]
*  get in a massive fight. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6298.8s)]
*  And we were like fighting for our lives in this club. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6300.78s)]
*  This guy didn't have a scratch on him. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6302.78s)]
*  He stood on the outside. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6303.78s)]
*  He instigated the fight. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6304.78s)]
*  You're robust bro. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6305.78s)]
*  You're robust. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6306.78s)]
*  He was Rick Ross outside. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6307.78s)]
*  And you know the worst part? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6308.78s)]
*  How do you do that bro? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6311.78s)]
*  You know the worst part? [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6314.78s)]
*  You know the worst part? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6315.78s)]
*  We went outside and I was like, oh I forgot my jacket. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6316.78s)]
*  This fucking prick. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6319.78s)]
*  We were on our way out and the guys that were walking past were literally like, you guys [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6320.78s)]
*  are dead tonight. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6328.240000000001s)]
*  As soon as you get outside, you're getting stabbed. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6329.240000000001s)]
*  And this fucker's at the cloakroom like I need my jacket. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6332.160000000001s)]
*  And we were like bro fuck your jacket we need to go. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6334.160000000001s)]
*  And he was like I'm not going anywhere without my jacket. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6337.160000000001s)]
*  I might kill you that night bro. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6339.160000000001s)]
*  I got my jacket. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6342.160000000001s)]
*  Did they press y'all outside? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6345.160000000001s)]
*  We left. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6347.160000000001s)]
*  We got out fine. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6348.160000000001s)]
*  We got out fine. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6349.160000000001s)]

*  I think that's the only time. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6367.3s)]
*  That's the only time. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6368.3s)]
*  It's America recollection. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6369.3s)]
*  Was there a conversation in the car afterwards? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6370.3s)]
*  There was a converse. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6371.3s)]

*  And there was a conversation when we got back to uni because we drove back to uni and we [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6376.3s)]
*  got picked up in it. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6381.3s)]
*  We got picked up. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6382.3s)]

*  By the time we made it back to campus there was a conversation. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6384.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6387.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6388.4400000000005s)]
*  What were you saying? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6389.4400000000005s)]
*  First of all, fight your own fucking fights. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6390.4400000000005s)]
*  There's no way you'll get into a fight and you don't even get touched. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6393.4400000000005s)]
*  And all the boys are just home with black eyes. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6396.4400000000005s)]
*  That's not a thing. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6399.4400000000005s)]
*  And then secondly, yeah, just keep your fucking hands to yourself. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6400.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6403.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6404.4400000000005s)]
*  That was a tough day. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6405.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6406.4400000000005s)]
*  That was a test. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6407.4400000000005s)]
*  That was testing for our friendship actually. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6408.4400000000005s)]
*  Really? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6410.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6411.4400000000005s)]
*  Building blocks. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6412.4400000000005s)]
*  And you guys almost stopped being friends? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6413.58s)]
*  No. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6414.58s)]
*  No. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6415.58s)]
*  Not even close? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6416.58s)]
*  No. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6417.58s)]
*  That was the closest moment. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6418.58s)]
*  That was probably the closest moment. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6419.58s)]
*  We probably had one other argument. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6420.58s)]
*  Oh, what happened? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6421.58s)]
*  This was again stupid. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6422.58s)]
*  This is actually girl related as well. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6423.58s)]
*  This is a minor argument, but it's like, you know, don't look at me. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6424.94s)]
*  You know, this argument was more like, oh, that's why he's kind of minor. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6428.54s)]
*  In comparison, it is minor. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6437.379999999999s)]
*  In comparison, it's minor. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6439.379999999999s)]
*  You think you know someone and you have that impulse where you're like, bro, who the fuck, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6441.32s)]
*  like who are you? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6445.16s)]
*  Yeah, like when you're cheating on your girl. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6446.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6447.16s)]
*  It was one of those moments again, again, stupid girl related question or situation, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6448.16s)]
*  sorry. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6454.08s)]
*  We were on a night out in Manchester. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6455.08s)]
*  This is where he lived in Manchester. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6456.76s)]
*  I had met a girl and I was staying with him and then she was trying to come back. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6458.88s)]
*  So I just assumptively was like, bro, give me the keys. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6463.76s)]
*  I'm going to head back to the spot and take care of business. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6467.5s)]
*  And he was like, I'm not going to give them out. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6470.7s)]
*  Because he lived in a two bed. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6473.7s)]
*  Basically context, I would have had to fuck the girl on his bed. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6475.299999999999s)]
*  So I was like, bro, give me the keys. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6478.339999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6479.339999999999s)]
*  And he was like, nah, you're not going anywhere. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6480.339999999999s)]
*  You're not banging this gun on my bed. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6483.0599999999995s)]
*  I was like, bro, come on. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6484.54s)]
*  All jokes aside, the girl's here. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6486.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to need those keys. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6487.0199999999995s)]
*  You are going on the stairs. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6488.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to need the keys now. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6489.0199999999995s)]
*  And then he was just on business like, nah, bro, I'm not happening. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6490.0199999999995s)]
*  And it was one of those moments where I was like, how have I misread this situation so [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6495.6s)]
*  far? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6500.080000000001s)]
*  I thought I knew that. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6501.080000000001s)]
*  Are you my friend or not? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6502.080000000001s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6503.080000000001s)]
*  And it actually got into a heated argument of like, dude. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6506.080000000001s)]
*  Okay, what was the rationale? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6509.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the rationale. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6511.080000000001s)]
*  I was like, dude, again, I suck your dick to save your life. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6512.080000000001s)]
*  I'll do anything for you. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6515.080000000001s)]
*  Like if you want to fuck her on the bed while I'm in there, I don't care. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6516.080000000001s)]
*  Whatever makes you happy, go do it. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6519.080000000001s)]
*  I can't believe we're in this situation where you're saying no. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6521.080000000001s)]
*  I'll clean the sheets. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6524.14s)]
*  I'll flip the money. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6525.14s)]
*  Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6526.14s)]
*  I don't understand why this is an issue. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6527.14s)]
*  And? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6528.14s)]
*  And he didn't fuck the girl. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6529.14s)]
*  No, no, but like. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6530.14s)]
*  He was watching out for not letting me. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6531.14s)]
*  Oh, I just feel like if I had at the time, if I was staying in a place where there was [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6532.14s)]
*  a two bed, two bath kind of thing, fine, take the other room. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6538.14s)]
*  Wait, you would need a second bath for him to fuck the girl? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6540.14s)]
*  No, I'm just saying that. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6543.14s)]
*  Forget the two bath. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6546.14s)]
*  I'm used to it. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6548.14s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6550.14s)]
*  If it was a situation where I had a spare room, I just feel like, OK, casing point. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6551.200000000001s)]
*  I feel like we're at Oxford. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6558.200000000001s)]
*  OK, cool. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6560.200000000001s)]
*  This is a debate. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6561.200000000001s)]
*  Cool. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6562.200000000001s)]
*  Let me actually give you an example. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6563.200000000001s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6564.200000000001s)]
*  There was a time, I don't think he knows this, there was a time I was staying at his and [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6565.200000000001s)]
*  at the time I was with my ex at the time and she wanted to fuck. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6571.200000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not fucking you in my boy's room. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6574.200000000001s)]
*  I'm just not doing that. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6578.200000000001s)]
*  And this was years after this situation you just explained about. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6580.26s)]
*  So it's just probably my principle more than anything else. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6583.26s)]
*  It has nothing to do with our friendship, in my opinion. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6586.26s)]
*  Are you messy in bed? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6588.26s)]
*  It's not even about messy. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6590.26s)]
*  It's more so about the, it's not my bed, bro. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6591.26s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6594.26s)]
*  It's not a hotel. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6595.26s)]
*  I'm not going to treat the bedroom like a hotel because it's not a hotel. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6596.26s)]
*  This is his bedroom. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6600.26s)]
*  So that's just my standpoint. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6601.26s)]
*  He gets down like that, bro. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6603.26s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6604.26s)]
*  That's my standpoint. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6605.26s)]
*  I mean, he wouldn't do it, so it is fair. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6606.26s)]

*  What the fuck? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6849.02s)]
*  Oh, you want it to be UK based? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6850.02s)]
*  No, it can be anything, but nobody in history has ever said the hottest girl on the planet [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6851.02s)]
*  is Meg the stallion. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6857.02s)]
*  You're flucking something out of your head. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6858.02s)]
*  Yeah, they have, by the way. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6859.02s)]
*  Jamie likes a nice big girl, you know? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6860.02s)]
*  Meg can take it down. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6863.02s)]
*  Top five in the world? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6864.02s)]
*  She also loves anime. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6865.02s)]
*  It's a big thing. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6866.02s)]
*  She also loves anime. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6867.080000000001s)]
*  It's a big thing. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6868.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she does love anime. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6869.080000000001s)]
*  She's a big anime. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6871.080000000001s)]
*  What's wrong, bro? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6874.080000000001s)]
*  What's wrong, bro? [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6875.080000000001s)]
*  She's fire, bro. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6877.080000000001s)]
*  Yo, Al, cut it out. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6880.080000000001s)]
*  Who doesn't want to shoot? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6882.080000000001s)]
*  Yo, you're crazy. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6884.080000000001s)]
*  You're just an asshole. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6885.080000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie, she is a strong 5'11", which is tough. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6887.080000000001s)]
*  No, no, okay, she's a beautiful girl. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6890.080000000001s)]
*  I don't even, but the top five, the first one. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6893.080000000001s)]
*  I don't have time for this sake to keep the heat of the conversation. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6895.14s)]
*  I was flucking the first name that came into my head. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6898.14s)]
*  I don't personally think Meg the stallion is the top five hottest girls in the world. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6900.14s)]
*  She's beautiful. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6903.14s)]
*  She's banging a girl. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6904.14s)]
*  She's banging a beautiful girl. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6905.14s)]
*  Okay, what I was trying to present is a potential situation where you would be inclined to allow [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6906.14s)]
*  him because the girl was just so unbelievably hot. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6912.14s)]
*  There was a certain caliber of girl that he would have loved 100%. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6915.14s)]
*  And that girl didn't match it. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6917.14s)]
*  I don't remember what the girl looked like. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6919.14s)]
*  I don't know if I saw the girl. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6920.14s)]
*  She didn't. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6921.14s)]
*  She really didn't. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6922.200000000001s)]
*  She really didn't. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6923.200000000001s)]
*  But there is no way on this earth I would see that he's potentially closed with a 10'10", [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6924.200000000001s)]
*  and he's not banging on my sofa or my bed. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6931.200000000001s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6933.200000000001s)]
*  Because he won't let me live that now. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6934.200000000001s)]
*  That's love. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6935.200000000001s)]
*  That's my brother. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6936.200000000001s)]
*  That's my fucking brother. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6937.200000000001s)]
*  That's what the fuck I'm talking about, bro. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6938.200000000001s)]
*  Okay, if it's just a random nut from a girl that you don't even remember, I kind of am [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6939.200000000001s)]
*  agreeing with that. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6943.1s)]
*  Yeah, I hear it. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6944.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think you got logic. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6945.1s)]
*  But you're still loyal because you wouldn't let him miss a golden opportunity. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6947.3s)]
*  Never. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6950.3s)]
*  My bro. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6951.46s)]
*  Never. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6952.46s)]
*  Yeah, he was trying to bring the uni-whore back. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6953.46s)]
*  Yeah, but she was a tot. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6955.46s)]
*  What's a tot? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6957.46s)]
*  You didn't use tot? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6960.46s)]
*  No. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6962.46s)]
*  A tot is like... [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6963.46s)]
*  It's a whore. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6964.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6965.46s)]
*  It's just another word for... [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6966.46s)]
*  It's a slag. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6967.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6968.46s)]
*  A slag. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6969.46s)]
*  Dude, heinous. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6970.46s)]
*  I love that one. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6971.46s)]
*  That's heinous. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6972.46s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6973.46s)]
*  I can't wait to say that to someone. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6974.46s)]
*  That is heinous. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6977.46s)]
*  That is heinous. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6978.62s)]
*  My enemies have succeeded is my personal favorite. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6979.62s)]
*  Yeah, we need more Nigerianisms. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6981.62s)]
*  My enemies have succeeded against me. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6984.62s)]
*  I personally don't use them that much, you know. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6986.62s)]
*  I feel like for me, it's probably like scenario based or role playing based again. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6987.62s)]
*  Can you explain role playing? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6993.62s)]
*  You keep bringing that up. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6994.62s)]
*  I knew you were gonna say that. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6995.62s)]
*  No, no, I genuinely... [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6996.62s)]
*  So, for example, there could be a dilemma we read out or something that's happening. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=6997.62s)]
*  Oh, you're just acting. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7000.62s)]
*  I know that. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7001.62s)]
*  I'm just acting now. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7002.62s)]
*  So we can go with that role playing. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7003.62s)]
*  I forgot the fucking question. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7004.62s)]
*  What was the question? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7005.62s)]
*  But you don't use a lot of the Nigerians. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7006.62s)]
*  So I would most likely like pluck something from the contextual situation and my response [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7007.78s)]
*  is maybe like very Nigerian. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7013.62s)]
*  But I don't necessarily say stuff like my enemies. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7015.42s)]
*  Use the euphemism. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7019.099999999999s)]
*  It just comes out. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7020.099999999999s)]
*  You'll say age mate. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7021.099999999999s)]
*  I've never heard of that before. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7022.099999999999s)]
*  What's that? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7023.099999999999s)]
*  Because my parents say that. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7024.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7025.099999999999s)]
*  So, for example, my mom would say, I would say, yo, what's good, bro? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7026.099999999999s)]
*  If, for example, I don't... [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7030.66s)]
*  But if I would say to my mom, what's good, bro? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7031.66s)]
*  My mom would be like, am I your age mate? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7033.14s)]
*  Am I your peer? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7034.62s)]
*  Am I your kid? [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7035.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7036.62s)]
*  So that's, I say age mate because my parents said age mate. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7037.62s)]
*  See what I'm saying? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7040.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7041.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7042.26s)]
*  Before we get out of here, you guys have to get a flight. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7043.26s)]
*  You have to go to Dallas. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7045.54s)]
*  You have a show tonight in Dallas? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7046.54s)]
*  No, on Thursday. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7048.62s)]
*  Couple days. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7049.62s)]
*  Shit, bro. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7050.62s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7051.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7052.62s)]
*  I can find out real quick. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7053.62s)]
*  One sec. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7054.98s)]
*  I should know. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7055.98s)]
*  We should know. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7056.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7057.98s)]
*  But I really don't. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7058.98s)]
*  Dallas is... [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7059.98s)]
*  The factory? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7060.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7061.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7062.98s)]
*  I know. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7063.98s)]
*  Yeah, I know of it. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7064.98s)]
*  The music factory? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7066.339999999999s)]
*  That's called the factory in Deep Elm. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7067.339999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think that's a music venue primarily. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7070.339999999999s)]
*  You guys gotta shoot a gun when you're down there. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7072.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7074.62s)]
*  I'm down there. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7075.62s)]
*  There's shotguns in Miami. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7076.62s)]
*  In Miami. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7077.62s)]
*  Yeah, Los Angeles. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7078.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7079.62s)]
*  Were you guys good at it? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7080.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7081.62s)]
*  Yeah, we actually were. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7082.62s)]
*  It's natural and yeah. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7083.62s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7084.62s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean natural? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7085.62s)]
*  He said he's sharp. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7086.62s)]
*  He's quick, bro. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7087.62s)]
*  He's quick. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7088.62s)]
*  Fuck, bro. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7089.62s)]
*  I don't even know what you guys are... [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7090.62s)]
*  What the fuck ever, bro? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7091.62s)]
*  The English are not good at shooting guns where they lost. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7092.62s)]
*  Is that what you mean? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7096.1s)]
*  That's not what you meant. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7097.1s)]
*  That's not what you meant. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7098.1s)]
*  That's how I interpret it. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7099.1s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7100.1s)]
*  Before we get out of here, can you just tell me, how do you guys learn history? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7101.1s)]
*  You know how in America we have an Americanized version of history that kind of like... [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7104.34s)]
*  We talk about slavery because we have to, because there's black people everywhere, but [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7108.66s)]
*  we don't talk about Native Americans shit that much because they ain't around. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7112.7s)]
*  So what do you do in British history when you're learning it? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7116.74s)]
*  Do you learn about the colonies? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7121.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you learn about the empire? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7122.5199999999995s)]
*  Is it too close and people feel uncomfortable? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7124.62s)]
*  I didn't... [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7126.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not even saying this as a joke, but do you learn like, yeah, we fucked India [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7127.74s)]
*  over, we fucked this country, we fucked America over? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7130.3s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7131.3s)]
*  We don't actually... [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7132.3s)]
*  I don't know what the curriculum is like now, but I remember in school, I learned about [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7133.3s)]
*  colonization from like Americans. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7138.3s)]
*  You guys learn way more about it than we do. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7140.58s)]
*  We don't know anything about it. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7142.0199999999995s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7143.58s)]
*  They put it in the curriculum. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7144.58s)]
*  It's not in the curriculum whatsoever. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7145.58s)]
*  And they also don't do it for Americans. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7146.58s)]
*  Like, we don't learn about what we're doing around the world that much either. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7148.7s)]
*  I'm just curious your version of it. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7152.1s)]
*  So our version is more like World War II. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7154.38s)]
*  World War I, World War II, we were banging out, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7156.26s)]
*  They killed the Nazis and then nothing bad happened before that. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7159.22s)]
*  Yeah, we don't learn about like... [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7161.9800000000005s)]
*  Like Henry VIII, all that shit. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7163.66s)]
*  Yeah, we learn about like former kings and queens, probably like the invention of medicine, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7164.9800000000005s)]
*  which a lot of it was like British led. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7170.26s)]
*  We don't learn about like anything to do with like American independence. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7171.78s)]
*  We don't learn about that. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7177.58s)]
*  None of that war stuff. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7178.58s)]
*  We don't learn about that. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7179.58s)]
*  We learn about World War I, World War II. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7180.58s)]
*  I gotta talk about their losses, bro. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7182.78s)]
*  So we talk about our losses a little bit. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7184.78s)]
*  Vietnam we talk about. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7186.78s)]
*  But it's recent. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7188.98s)]
*  You guys can kind of ignore... [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7189.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's no video evidence. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7191.98s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7193.98s)]
*  Okay, so then when you start learning about the world, is there... [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7194.98s)]
*  Because I think this is happening a lot in America where now with the internet information [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7199.94s)]
*  is democratized and you can start learning like, oh, what the CIA is responsible for. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7203.22s)]
*  When you guys go out and you start learning about like British history, is there like [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7208.66s)]
*  a red pillization and don't use the word red pill with like the I hate women shit, but [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7213.58s)]
*  more about like, oh, this is what really happened? [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7219.06s)]
*  Or do you just kind of ignore... [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7221.82s)]
*  For me personally, there's a little bit of it. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7224.34s)]
*  And like, for example, like a prime example, right, so my surname is Duncan. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7230.02s)]
*  I went on a family trip to Grenada a few years ago. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7235.62s)]
*  And they give you a tour of the island. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7240.58s)]
*  And we stumbled across the Duncan plantation. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7242.94s)]
*  Your family? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7245.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7246.78s)]
*  Slave owners? [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7247.78s)]
*  No, slaves. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7248.78s)]
*  My black name is Duncan. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7249.78s)]
*  Wow. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7250.78s)]
*  Oh, your dad is black, your mom is white. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7251.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7253.78s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7254.78s)]
*  So yeah, we found the plantation that obviously my family was workers on. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7255.78s)]
*  And like that growing up, like I didn't understand. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7262.14s)]
*  And then like you grow up and you realize that like, so there's a lot, there's huge [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7265.1s)]
*  like Caribbean culture in the UK and you realize that all Caribbean's have white surnames. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7268.5s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7273.740000000001s)]
*  And you, I didn't realize that until like older why that was. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7275.1s)]
*  So there was, for me personally, there's a lot growing up. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7279.780000000001s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7281.9800000000005s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7282.9800000000005s)]
*  And then again, with like colonization and stuff, like I was a grown man before the term [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7283.9800000000005s)]
*  colonizer was even, I didn't even was introduced to it. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7287.660000000001s)]
*  I was like, I don't even know what the fuck that is. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7290.58s)]
*  So then you have to learn about it, learn about it, learn about it. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7292.22s)]
*  And I think the only thing that helps is that again, call back, we're not very patriotic. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7294.54s)]
*  So it's very easy for us to be like. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7301.4s)]
*  To reject that. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7302.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's very easy. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7303.66s)]
*  Same with like royal family and all that kind of shit. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7304.66s)]
*  We're like, fuck them anyway. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7306.38s)]
*  There are like issues with a lack of patriotism because when you do need to galvanize a country [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7308.66s)]
*  for something, it might be a little bit more difficult. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7312.42s)]
*  Like let's say you need to go fight in a war, it's probably harder to get everybody go fight [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7314.5s)]
*  for the flag if you don't really believe that. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7318.86s)]
*  That's not a thing in England by the way, because they tried that recently, our prime [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7320.7s)]
*  minister who just got fired out, he was trying to introduce a draft or something. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7324.38s)]
*  I think he was 16 year old. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7327.82s)]
*  16 up, just like a couple years of service. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7328.82s)]
*  Like everyone was like, dude, I'll go to Dubai like tomorrow. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7330.78s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, that is a tricky thing. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7333.86s)]
*  And it is a tricky thing, I think for Americans to wrestle with because we are so patriotic. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7340.0199999999995s)]
*  And now we're learning about some of the things that America has done. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7343.46s)]
*  And you're like, well, I really want to love this place, but I got to wrestle with the [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7346.38s)]
*  past. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7350.18s)]
*  Now, no country is completely innocent, but you have to find a thing you can love about [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7351.18s)]
*  it. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7355.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7356.740000000001s)]
*  And despite the past of Great Britain, there's amazing contributions to the world. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7357.740000000001s)]
*  So there are things you can really love and be proud of with even, despite what you guys [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7362.14s)]
*  did to... [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7367.700000000001s)]
*  Sorry, bro. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7368.700000000001s)]

*  Clearly I didn't do it. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7370.700000000001s)]
*  I didn't tell you about the plantation. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwAAbXDlOo&t=7371.700000000001s)]
