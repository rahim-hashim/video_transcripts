# Trump Gets WASHED By Kamala in Debate?!
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ)
*  Trump vs Kamala, the Thrillian Philly, Orange vs the New Black, the Felon and the Melon, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  this debate had it all. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Kamala shocked Trump up top by giving him a central part five, and that's the first [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8.08s)]
*  time in history a politician went limp in her hands. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=12.3s)]
*  Trump started out strong, and Kamala seemed nervous. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=15.52s)]
*  She was sweating like Dave Grohl at a paternity test. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=18.04s)]
*  But then everything changed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=20.76s)]
*  Kamala baited Trump like a master. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=23.32s)]
*  She played Trump like a steel drum. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=25.98s)]
*  How did she do it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=27.98s)]
*  She said people were walking out of his rallies. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=29.28s)]
*  Donnie melted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  I mean, if he was any more unhinged, he'd be a door on a Boeing flight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  He was furious. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=37.36s)]
*  But with the election on the line, he composed himself and responded with a thoughtful counterpoint. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=38.36s)]
*  They're eating the dogs, the people that came in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=44.6s)]
*  They're eating the cats. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=47.36s)]
*  They're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  What? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=54.36s)]
*  You're saying the hungry, hungry Haitians are eating dogs and cats. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=55.36s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=58.84s)]
*  Caribbean men don't eat pussy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=60.04s)]
*  Speaking of which, Taylor Swift posted this picture endorsing Kamala Harris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, you'd think she was endorsing Trump the way that she's grabbing that kitty. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=66.4s)]
*  I mean, she's clutching that cat like she just saw a Haitian with chopsticks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=70.12s)]
*  OK, last Haitian joke. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=73.72s)]
*  Taylor's endorsement of a politician is massive and probably the biggest poll boost from teens [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=76.84s)]
*  since Dr. Disrespect's DMs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=82.08s)]
*  And that was basically it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=84.6s)]
*  That's the whole debate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=86.68s)]
*  No one really explained how they would achieve any of their goals. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=87.94s)]
*  Just continuous name calling, ridiculous claims and partisan insults. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  So the question is, where do we go from here? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  The answer? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=98.66s)]
*  Nowhere. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=100.16s)]
*  Trump and Harris will continue to lie to get votes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=101.58s)]
*  The media will continue to make money spinning the lies. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  And we will all be anxious and filled with dread watching the spin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=107.66s)]
*  I mean, just ask yourself, who do you think won? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=111.14s)]
*  Let me guess, the candidate that you are already supporting? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=114.74s)]
*  Of course, because that's how it works. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  That is the system. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=120.78s)]
*  The truth is subjective. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=122.02s)]
*  So I want to remind you right now is incredibly important that you go out there and vote, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=124.02s)]
*  because remember, this election is the most important election of our lifetime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  Until the next one. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  OK, boys. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  Uncle Donnie got absolutely dog walked by Kamala. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=140.78s)]
*  And here's the thing, I want to hear what everybody has to say about it, but what is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=146.18s)]
*  so hilarious and is also so disheartening and so proof that there is no truth anymore [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  is that everybody saw it with their own eyes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  If you're an objective viewer, you watched it and you're like, she did better than he [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=160.26000000000002s)]
*  did. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  Maybe you really like him, you like everything he's saying. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  We all find him funny. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=168.02s)]
*  That's no longer taboo. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=169.34s)]
*  We all find him fascinating and interesting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=170.5s)]
*  And I actually think that there is, I do believe there's part of them that really does want [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=172.38s)]
*  to help. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=176.3s)]
*  I genuinely do believe that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=177.3s)]
*  I know you don't have to, but I don't doubt that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=178.62s)]
*  I think there's part of them that genuinely does want to help. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=181.26s)]
*  But he got worked. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=184.78s)]
*  He got absolutely demolished. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=185.78s)]
*  He got worked. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=186.78s)]
*  But if you go online, the echo chambers exists. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=187.78s)]
*  He's touting it as a victory. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=191.7s)]
*  All of his supporters are like, oh my God, that was fucking amazing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=193.1s)]
*  Trump is killing it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=196.34s)]
*  The moderators were so biased, but he still killed it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=197.86s)]
*  And I realize now that the reason truth doesn't exist anymore is because if you only operate [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=201.86s)]
*  within your narrative, that becomes your truth. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  So there's a million different truths. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=210.3s)]
*  You choose your own truth now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=211.3s)]
*  You choose your own truth. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=212.3s)]
*  Truth doesn't exist. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=213.3s)]
*  You believe whatever you want. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=214.3s)]
*  All of his supporters are going to think he fucking won, even though they know they're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=215.3s)]
*  fucking lying to themselves. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  The Kamala supporters, the Kamala supporters are going to think they won, which they should. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=218.94000000000003s)]
*  She did a better job. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=223.94000000000003s)]
*  She out, not only out class, she out strategy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=226.66s)]
*  It was art of war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=232.46s)]
*  It was art of war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=234.42s)]
*  Let's get into that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=235.42s)]
*  You guys go. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=236.42s)]
*  Go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=237.42s)]
*  Go. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=238.42s)]
*  I mean, literally, the biggest point is the fact that she was able to bait him so easily. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=239.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=243.7s)]
*  The first 20 minutes I'm watching and I'm like, Trump is cooking. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=244.7s)]
*  This Trump is cooking. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=248.78s)]
*  This Trump is fire. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=250.3s)]
*  Polished. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=251.82s)]
*  Strong. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=252.82s)]
*  Polished. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=253.82s)]
*  Not emotionally volatile or reactive. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=254.82s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=257.26s)]
*  She is nervous. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=258.26s)]
*  She got the hands going. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=259.26s)]
*  Once her hands come up, she don't know the next words she's going to say. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=260.58s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  We've all been there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=263.97999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=264.97999999999996s)]
*  She's looking a little bit flustered. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  She started a little nervous. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=266.97999999999996s)]
*  And it was like, you know, this is the big stage. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=267.97999999999996s)]
*  This is your moment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=269.97999999999996s)]
*  You win this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  The election is probably yours. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  She's got everything to lose because she's coming in. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=272.97999999999996s)]
*  At least the perception is she's on top, but we don't know what the fuck truth is anyway. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  Hit him with the handshake, which I thought was smart. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=278.7s)]
*  That was alpha shit. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=280.38s)]
*  Alpha dog shit. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=281.38s)]
*  She went to his side. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=282.38s)]
*  I'm invading your territory like you're in Ukraine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=284.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=286.94s)]
*  I like his thing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=287.94s)]
*  And Kamala, like, say my name right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=288.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=290.94s)]
*  Pronounce the fuck out of it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=291.94s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, have fun. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=292.94s)]
*  Yeah, have some fun. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=293.94s)]
*  And she goes, operating good faith or something like that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=294.94s)]
*  Some gay shit. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=296.94s)]
*  I thought that was pussy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=297.94s)]
*  But okay, he's cooking. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=298.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  I want to make sure we all think it's the exact same moment. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=305.78s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=306.78s)]
*  Go to his rallies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=307.78s)]
*  I'm going to invite you to go to his rallies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=308.78s)]
*  He perked up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=311.18s)]
*  He's like, what? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=312.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=313.18s)]
*  Why would she compliment me like this? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=314.66s)]
*  Notice people are leaving early. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=317.38s)]
*  It's over. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=319.02s)]
*  He fucking twitched a little bit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=320.02s)]
*  Like, you suck. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=322.02s)]
*  It's over. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=323.02s)]
*  If you literally watch the transcript, it goes at like 37 minutes, she says go to his [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=324.02s)]
*  rallies, people are leaving. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  And at 38 minutes, he goes, they're eating dogs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=329.26s)]
*  They're all... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=332.86s)]
*  He fucking exploded. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=333.86s)]
*  Kamala eats dogs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=334.86s)]
*  I'm going to eat dogs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=335.86s)]
*  I mean, he just didn't know what to do with them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=336.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=338.86s)]
*  And I think it brought him back to... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=339.86s)]
*  I think there is a situation with Trump, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=342.9s)]
*  Trump has always been famous. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  He's always been successful. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  And there's been this relationship with him where it's like, he's this famous, successful [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=348.34s)]
*  guy, but not fully taken seriously. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=351.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=355.62s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=356.62s)]
*  He's got all these buildings. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=357.62s)]
*  He has this show on TV that's amazing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=358.62s)]
*  And you're like, wow, this guy's really entertaining. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=360.94s)]
*  But he is kind of silly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=362.9s)]
*  When he dances, it's kind of silly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=363.94s)]
*  And I think there's a little part of him that feels laughed at. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=365.9s)]
*  And his protection against being laughed at is the success. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  His justification for where he is is I'm a billionaire. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=375.94s)]
*  He loves it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=379.38s)]
*  It's a many billion, so many billion. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=380.38s)]
*  He's like, look at the numbers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=382.46s)]
*  You can say whatever you want about me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  Call me goofy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=385.17999999999995s)]
*  Say I'm orange. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=386.17999999999995s)]
*  Say my hair is whatever. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  But the numbers prove I'm a billionaire. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=388.17999999999995s)]
*  I'm successful. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=390.7s)]
*  And the people love me. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  Look at the numbers from my show. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  Look at the numbers from my rallies. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=395.53999999999996s)]
*  The only way to sell books is with my name. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=396.94s)]
*  And when she said people are walking out of your rallies, even if it's not true, it tapped [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=399.58s)]
*  back into that young man in New York who wasn't really taken seriously by his contemporaries [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=406.5s)]
*  and was trying desperately to be this famous, successful guy, creating his own narratives, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=412.46s)]
*  being his own publicist, calling companies, saying billionaire Donald Trump goes there. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=418.82s)]
*  And I think that imposter syndrome kicked in. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=423.22s)]
*  This is an 80 year old man. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=426.9s)]
*  She pulled the truck. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=428.78s)]
*  She pulled it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=429.78s)]
*  She pulled the truck. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=430.78s)]
*  And it wasn't ripped. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=431.78s)]
*  Trump always takes personal shots at you and then gets you off your game. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=432.78s)]
*  And now you're trying to address those personal shots. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=436.06s)]
*  And now you're not talking about the actual issues. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=438.5s)]
*  And I know that there are like super Trumpers that are watching this right now and they're [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=440.98s)]
*  unable to accept the reality of what happened. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=445.98s)]
*  I just want to remind you all. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=448.86s)]
*  A month ago when Kamala was announced as the nominee, okay, and all of a sudden the media [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=451.3s)]
*  and the people came out like she was the next coming of Jesus Christ. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=458.02s)]
*  And we all were like, this is so phony. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=463.14s)]
*  Nobody liked her for three and a half years. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=465.3s)]
*  Where is all this support? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=467.3s)]
*  This is absolutely bullshit. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=468.3s)]
*  Supporting Trump today and acting like that was a great performance is the exact same [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=470.58s)]
*  thing that the Democrats did with Kamala. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=475.42s)]
*  The exact same thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=478.58s)]
*  She did nothing for three and a half years and they were like, she is a genius. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=480.06s)]
*  He did nothing last night. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=483.14s)]
*  No, he did less than nothing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=484.14s)]
*  He got walked and out-strategized and out-manipulated. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=485.94s)]
*  Same echo chamber after Biden, the people who were just like, Biden didn't do that bad. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=489.86s)]
*  At least he told the truth. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=494.86s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=495.98s)]
*  He got dog-walked by Trump. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=496.98s)]
*  Call it what it is. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=498.74s)]
*  Because if you're not honest, no changes are going to happen. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=499.74s)]
*  He didn't get dog-walked. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=501.66s)]
*  He got put to sleep by Trump. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=502.66s)]
*  That dog couldn't walk. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=503.66s)]
*  Yeah, oh, Biden. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=504.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=505.66s)]
*  That was a much more decisive victory. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=506.66s)]
*  But still, this was clearly a victory for Kamala. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=509.06s)]
*  Oh, it's not even a question. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=510.9s)]
*  And what's, I read a Wall Street Journal like, the guy clearly wanted Trump to be, wants [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=512.38s)]
*  Trump to be president. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=516.38s)]
*  And he said it well. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=517.38s)]
*  He said Trump handed her the victory. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=518.38s)]
*  Anytime, dude, economic policy, he could have hammered her. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=520.78s)]
*  She didn't have one. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=524.66s)]
*  That's why I thought the line was funny because if you read her economic policy, it's four [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=525.94s)]
*  lines. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=528.9s)]
*  It's C-spot run, which is like a funny way of saying it's nothing. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=529.9s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=532.34s)]
*  But every time she just wouldn't answer and would bait him and he would take the bait [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=533.54s)]
*  and make it about emotions. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=537.18s)]
*  And I think throughout his life, throughout his career, he's had to defend his brand, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=538.3s)]
*  defend who he is, because I think there maybe is a little imposter syndrome. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=545.9s)]
*  We all have fucking imposter syndrome. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=548.9s)]
*  It's crazy when you look at people who are billionaires and they have it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=550.38s)]
*  It's crazy when you look at superstars that have it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=552.8599999999999s)]
*  You're like, how could you not believe in yourself? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=555.06s)]
*  Everybody's got a little bit. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=557.26s)]
*  That's part of what got them there. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=558.26s)]
*  Of course, it's that drive, that insatiable lust for success. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=559.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm not good enough yet. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  Now I'll be good enough. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=564.18s)]
*  Now I'll be good enough. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=565.18s)]
*  What was amazing is, and we've never seen this, he was on defense the entire rest of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=566.18s)]
*  the debate. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=572.78s)]
*  And he didn't have to be. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=573.78s)]
*  He could have just been like, hey, why aren't you doing all the policy stuff you're talking [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=574.78s)]
*  about right now? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=578.14s)]
*  There it is. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=579.14s)]
*  Like, do you support all of Biden's stuff? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=580.14s)]
*  Like, why did you support Biden for four years when he was completely messed up? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=581.3399999999999s)]
*  He said at the very end, but at that point it's over. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=584.9s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=587.66s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=588.66s)]
*  She's thrown him off the game. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=589.66s)]
*  That was his game plan. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=590.66s)]
*  It was supposed to be that whole time of just tying her to Biden. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=591.66s)]
*  This is more Biden. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=595.18s)]
*  And once you got that audience crowd comment, he was off his game plan. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=596.18s)]
*  And what she did was so massively, she points out that all the other leaders love him because [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=601.02s)]
*  he's so easily to be manipulated. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=606.5s)]
*  And then she just proved it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  And you show it happened. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  She showed it happened. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=611.3399999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=612.3399999999999s)]
*  That was great. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=613.3399999999999s)]
*  Wait, break that one down. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  I'll hear you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  So she basically said, other leaders love Donald Trump because he's so easily manipulated. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=616.3399999999999s)]
*  You can get this guy to do anything you want to. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=619.18s)]
*  And as she's saying that, she's proving it by goading him into any argument she wants, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=621.22s)]
*  setting the debate on her terms. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=626.34s)]
*  You're watching it happen in real time, whatever she's accusing him of. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  And she lied out the gate with that Project 2025 shit. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=630.9s)]
*  And the difference in how they both lied on each other, how the other person reacted was [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=634.1800000000001s)]
*  just crazy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=639.12s)]
*  Like Trump never took it well when she lied about him. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=640.12s)]
*  When he lied about her, she clearly had practiced it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=643.22s)]
*  She would just kind of smile, look down. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=645.86s)]
*  They worked on how she looks when he's talking, I'm sure, for hours. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=648.26s)]
*  Her debate prep was 10 times better. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=652.46s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=654.5s)]
*  I mean, and she didn't come across as goofy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=655.5s)]
*  She usually has this goofiness to her, a silliness that is not representative of a person in that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=657.7s)]
*  position of power, I'll just be honest. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=665.7s)]
*  It just came across, and that was a big concern. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=667.98s)]
*  It was like an instability to her demeanor. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=670.26s)]
*  Like I don't want you doing the cackle. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=674.18s)]
*  And I understand that this has been inflated, I'm sure, by the right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=676.1s)]
*  But I don't want you doing the cackle while you're negotiating with Xi Jinping. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=679.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=683.86s)]
*  I want you to show strength. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=685.38s)]
*  And I saw a lot of strength. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=687.5400000000001s)]
*  One thing that is kind of some gender shit is she's going to always have to worry about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=689.5s)]
*  getting emotional. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=692.78s)]
*  Like, because you're going to be like, I want this hysterical bitch in office. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=693.78s)]
*  We can't have a woman in office. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=696.82s)]
*  There's going to be people on some level thinking that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=697.82s)]
*  So I'm saying she has to be very measured. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=700.1s)]
*  The strength can't be too aggressive. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  Like everything has to be measured. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  And I thought she really did that well. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  This is how you know that it was a decisive victory. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=709.9s)]
*  And I have no proof to back this up at all. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=714.74s)]
*  But you know it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=718.9s)]
*  But I know it in my heart. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=719.9s)]
*  I think Taylor Swift is liberal. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=721.4599999999999s)]
*  She immediately posed for support for Kamala. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=726.9s)]
*  I don't know at what point in time of the debate. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=731.74s)]
*  Maybe it was right after the debate. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=734.14s)]
*  But she posted it that night. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=735.24s)]
*  But after it's known that there's a decisive victory. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=736.9s)]
*  And when Taylor, the most powerful woman in music, one of the most powerful people in [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=741.5s)]
*  the world culturally, when she puts all of her weight behind one of the nominees, that's [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  not like a flippant decision. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=755.82s)]
*  She knows exactly what the fuck she's doing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=758.38s)]
*  And I think she waited to the point where she was putting her money behind the winning [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=760.34s)]
*  horse. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=764.82s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=765.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=766.82s)]
*  If this debate goes better for Trump, I think she stays silent. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=767.82s)]
*  She stays quiet. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=769.6600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=770.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't think she's next to a single award. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=771.6600000000001s)]
*  She's not here to do recovery work for Kamala. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=773.0600000000001s)]
*  She's here to jump on at the end of the war when you're about to win and then take the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=776.62s)]
*  credit. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=781.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=782.5400000000001s)]
*  Because it can hurt her fan base too. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=783.5400000000001s)]
*  Please believe if you got every woman in the world, there's going to be some conservatives [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  in that fan base. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=788.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=789.1800000000001s)]
*  So she knows she's going to take a hit. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=791.02s)]
*  So she has to do it at the point where it's so decisive that even the Trump women that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=792.38s)]
*  come to her shows are like, yeah, he did kind of get hooked right there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't look that good. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=801.8599999999999s)]
*  She looks strong. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=803.04s)]
*  Beyonce can be an out front liberal because most of her fans are black women and black [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=804.04s)]
*  women tend to be liberal. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  So me being out front liberal just feeds them what they want. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=808.54s)]
*  Taylor is middle America. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=811.66s)]
*  She's got to masquerade a little bit. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=812.66s)]
*  She's got to be a little more neutral. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=813.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=814.66s)]
*  Taylor, I got this whole cross section of middle America. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=815.66s)]
*  They have different beliefs. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=818.52s)]
*  I have a lot of undecided people. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=819.52s)]
*  I have to pick the moment or shut the fuck up. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=820.52s)]
*  I got to be very strategic in how I do this. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=823.0s)]
*  And she again, yeah, she did it the right time. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=824.72s)]
*  How do you guys feel about the fact checking of the moderators? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=826.6s)]
*  I do think they were biased against Trump. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=832.84s)]
*  So here's my thing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=833.84s)]
*  I don't know enough. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=834.84s)]
*  I don't know enough. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=836.28s)]
*  But was Trump just saying more outlandish shit? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=838.12s)]
*  I was wondering. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=843.12s)]
*  Okay, so they were both lying, but Trump's lies were so crazy. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=844.12s)]
*  They're fact checking it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=848.12s)]
*  Now would Kamala lie with truths? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=849.72s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=853.48s)]
*  I forget exactly what it was. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=854.48s)]
*  I need to look it up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=855.48s)]
*  But I think the fracking thing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=856.48s)]
*  So I'm pretty sure she said like, oh yeah, we're going to ban fracking in this one specific [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=857.84s)]
*  place. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=861.2800000000001s)]
*  And then when Trump called her on, she's like, I never said that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=863.6s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure that was like just a blatant lie, but it's so subtle and nuanced that no [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=864.6s)]
*  one's going to even look into it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=869.0s)]
*  So everybody's going, the ABC moderators were so biased and they were correcting Trump on [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=870.2s)]
*  everything. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=874.6400000000001s)]
*  If you say super egregious lies, they're very easy to push back against. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=875.64s)]
*  If you say half truth lies, like it looked like the way politicians lie, where it has [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=881.64s)]
*  enough truth, where it's like, well, technically some of those jobs came from this. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=888.72s)]
*  It's like, all right, am I going to stop the debate to check her on something that could [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=894.88s)]
*  technically fit under the umbrella of truth, but she might be misleading in the way that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=900.36s)]
*  she says it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=904.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=905.64s)]
*  So I thought it was kind of unfair when you saw all the the Trump supporters going, oh, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=906.64s)]
*  it's so biased. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=911.36s)]
*  I look at the moderators only correcting one side. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=912.36s)]
*  I think you have to hold Trump a little bit more accountable. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=914.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=916.4s)]
*  Be better with your lies. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=917.4s)]
*  That's what I thought also crossed my mind. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=918.4s)]
*  Viscerally, I did feel like I felt like it was biased. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=919.88s)]
*  But then one thought crossed my mind. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=922.12s)]
*  Maybe they don't correct when one politician lies about the other politician. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=923.6s)]
*  Like if Kamala says Trump supports Project 2025, it's not, moderator might be like, it's [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=928.4s)]
*  not my job. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=933.32s)]
*  Oh, he's up there. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  No, I don't support Trump. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=936.0400000000001s)]
*  But if Trump goes, people in the Midwest are eating cats. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=937.0400000000001s)]
*  It's like, well, I got it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  The Midwest can't speak for itself here. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=942.96s)]
*  So that's a great point. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=944.48s)]
*  Lie on your lie on the person in front of you. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  They can respond. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=947.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to give them a minute. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=948.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=949.6400000000001s)]
*  Kamala's lies mainly seem to be about Trump and Trump's lies. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=950.6400000000001s)]
*  Like again, that is a nine month ban thing or the nine month post abortion. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=953.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=957.12s)]
*  Like, yeah, they're killing babies after they're born. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=958.12s)]
*  That's not an abortion. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  Also, that was another thing that he did. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=960.2800000000001s)]
*  He was so emotionally out of control that even when he had her on something, he would [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=962.24s)]
*  just keep spouting off and then they'd move on. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=970.56s)]
*  Like with the abortion thing, he's like, did you say or do you support 7, 8, even in the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=975.56s)]
*  ninth month? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=981.0s)]
*  He could have stopped right there and forced her to say yes. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=982.4s)]
*  I wanted to know her answer. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=985.28s)]
*  I really actually wanted to know. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=986.68s)]
*  And they're probably going to do it even afterwards. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  And then the moderator goes, OK, and now next question. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=990.24s)]
*  Force her to answer the question. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=994.64s)]
*  But she was ready to lower rates and shit like that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=995.64s)]
*  I did see her say that's not true in that moment, but I would love when he was asking, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=998.64s)]
*  I was like, I want to hear her address this. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1003.04s)]
*  But she was ready to fight back because during that she was like, oh, well, why don't you [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1004.72s)]
*  answer the question? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1007.96s)]
*  Would you veto a federal abortion ban? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1008.96s)]
*  So it's like she was ready. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1011.16s)]
*  She had an answer, but he didn't even let her give her pre-example answer. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1013.36s)]
*  With these debates, you've got to let them sink their own ship sometimes. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1017.32s)]
*  And I think what Trump had done really effectively in debates in the past, especially when there's [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1021.6400000000001s)]
*  nine people on stage and you have the audience, because the audience does play a part. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  I was watching it at the Comedy Cellar, right? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1029.76s)]
*  Upstairs, there's a bunch of people watching. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1031.96s)]
*  And when he would do his little quips, it would get laughs. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1034.4s)]
*  That is rattling to an opponent. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1037.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1039.92s)]
*  So if Kamala is hearing a thousand people in an auditorium laughing at what he's saying, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1042.64s)]
*  all of a sudden Trump is starting to get more energy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1048.24s)]
*  He's starting to feel motion. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  And also, you know what? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  He's not going to be as emotionally volatile because he feels the confidence. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1054.6000000000001s)]
*  That imposter syndrome is going away. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1059.64s)]
*  The worst thing that I think, the worst thing for Trump in this debate was not having an [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1061.96s)]
*  audience because he constantly needs the feedback to let him know. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1067.5200000000002s)]
*  I get this as a comedian. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1071.98s)]
*  Hey, you're funny. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1073.26s)]
*  You're good. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1074.7s)]
*  People like you. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1075.7s)]
*  When he's just spouting off, he's seeking it, but it's not there. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1076.7s)]
*  Any comic will tell you the first laugh frees you up so much. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1079.6200000000001s)]
*  You want to get that first laugh as quickly as possible. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1083.02s)]
*  I remember him always saying that he figured out comedy very quickly. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1084.78s)]
*  He was like, that first laugh, you need that quickly. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1087.94s)]
*  Because then you just go, ah, we're having fun. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1089.7s)]
*  Life tour update. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1092.6200000000001s)]

*  Guys, don't fast forward. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1121.94s)]
*  This is important. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1123.1s)]
*  This part is not about me. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1123.86s)]
*  I'll get to me later with selfish shit. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1124.98s)]
*  But asshole army, we have a listener whose mom is missing. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1126.82s)]
*  That makes me want to cry just saying it out loud. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1130.42s)]
*  I cannot think of anything that would be more painful unless, you know, whatever. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1132.7s)]
*  I'm not going to say anything worse. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1137.54s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1185.3799999999999s)]
*  Every debate with an audience, he does well. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1186.4199999999998s)]
*  And think about how he does well even at his rallies. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1188.82s)]
*  He has an audience. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1191.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's why he loves the rallies. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1192.06s)]
*  I'm getting the feedback. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1193.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm getting the confirmation. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1194.82s)]
*  Always needing that. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1196.26s)]
*  Yeah, we're silencing the imposter syndrome. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1196.8999999999999s)]

*  When you're talking to one woman who you know hates you and then two moderators [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1202.3s)]
*  that you're unsure about their biases, about politics, about who they want for president, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1206.58s)]
*  he probably just feels under attack. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1211.02s)]
*  And when you feel under attack, you need to defend. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1213.94s)]
*  We don't need him defending. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1215.8600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1217.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1218.14s)]
*  Now, I also want to point out... [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1218.74s)]
*  But also, that's his fault. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1220.66s)]
*  He needs to be more prepared. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1222.1000000000001s)]
*  We're not making excuses here. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1223.8200000000002s)]
*  You need this as the job. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1225.38s)]
*  And you need to prepare for the job. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1227.02s)]
*  And then even to the preparation thing, do you have a plan? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1228.5400000000002s)]
*  I have a concept. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1231.7s)]
*  Concept of a plan. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1232.7800000000002s)]
*  That's the same thing I didn't like about Kamlo. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1233.94s)]
*  She seemed to have no plan. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1235.6200000000001s)]
*  So for Trump to not have a plan, I was very deflated by that of like, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1237.3000000000002s)]
*  well, what the fuck, man? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1240.98s)]
*  It's cool that I have a plan. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1242.3000000000002s)]
*  Don't say it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1243.7s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1244.38s)]
*  Maybe like, I have a plan that will be released once I'm elected. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1245.22s)]
*  She just pivoted and didn't acknowledge it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1248.26s)]
*  She didn't have a plan, but he acknowledged it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1250.14s)]
*  She never addressed not having a plan. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1251.5s)]
*  I don't really have one. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1252.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1253.5s)]
*  I don't think Kamlo said that many great things. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1254.26s)]
*  She just didn't say any bad things. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1256.3400000000001s)]
*  She was very polished. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1258.38s)]
*  She was a politician. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1259.78s)]
*  No, she had some good shots. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1260.54s)]
*  She had some good... [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1261.74s)]
*  But when she said 81 million people fired Donald Trump, that was... [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1262.3s)]
*  Oh, that hurt him, dog. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1265.66s)]
*  That hurt the fuck out of him. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1266.94s)]
*  I hurt his soul. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1268.54s)]
*  No, no, she had bars. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1269.38s)]
*  He's saying she didn't have substance. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1271.26s)]
*  No, no, 100%. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1272.98s)]
*  But she had bars, dude. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1274.5s)]
*  Wrong things. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1275.74s)]
*  He also has some funny bars. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1276.42s)]
*  The T-Spot run shit was good. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1277.46s)]
*  That shit got me. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  The on talking. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1279.78s)]
*  Wake him up at 4 PM was funny. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1281.6200000000001s)]
*  Wake him up at 4 PM was funny. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1282.98s)]
*  I didn't think I'm talking like that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1284.22s)]
*  That didn't hit. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1285.38s)]
*  In the Comedy Cellar, that shit got a huge laugh. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1286.22s)]
*  Because she said that, I think, in a bunch of her... [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1291.46s)]
*  He's mocking her. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1294.02s)]
*  But because the mics are off, it didn't... [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1295.42s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't hear her talking. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1298.06s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't hear her talking. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1299.18s)]
*  It sounded like he just said it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1300.14s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1301.58s)]
*  We heard her. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1302.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1302.78s)]
*  And it is unlikable when she says it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1303.82s)]
*  And when I didn't hear her, I was like, why you... [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1305.34s)]
*  Just go on, dude. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1308.06s)]
*  I felt like he said it because he was annoyed [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1309.42s)]
*  and then tried to cover. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1310.98s)]
*  That was my read of it. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1311.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1312.7s)]
*  We have a president who doesn't know he's alive. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1313.22s)]
*  That was so good. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1315.38s)]
*  For a guy to say it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1316.34s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1317.5s)]
*  Great. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1318.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1319.38s)]
*  I mean, there was... [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1320.58s)]
*  What I will say is this. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1321.8600000000001s)]
*  All the people that had this instant enthusiasm [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1322.66s)]
*  for Kamala a few weeks ago, based on absolutely nothing, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1325.66s)]
*  after this debate, they're going... [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1330.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1332.5s)]
*  Because now they get to look like they're right [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1333.7s)]
*  the whole time, even though they had no fucking clue [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1335.3400000000001s)]
*  this was going to go well. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1337.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1338.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1339.22s)]
*  I've been wrong the past two elections, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1340.7s)]
*  but my thought was the election hinges on this debate. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1343.26s)]
*  Because if you're undecided, you're probably like, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1347.46s)]
*  I want to vote for this girl. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1350.5s)]
*  I just don't know anything about her. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1352.02s)]
*  I don't like her. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1353.78s)]
*  I don't know if she's presidential. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1354.42s)]
*  And I felt like even though she didn't give us real substance, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1356.02s)]
*  she looked presidential. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1358.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1359.78s)]
*  And I think the problem with supporting Trump's performance [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1360.3s)]
*  is that if you're not going to be honest with him [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1363.62s)]
*  as one of his supporters, if you're not going to be honest [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1367.5s)]
*  with him about this performance, why would he do anything [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1370.46s)]
*  different in the next debate? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1372.66s)]
*  And if he doesn't do anything different in the next debate, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1374.3799999999999s)]
*  he'll continue to dig himself a hole. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1376.74s)]
*  He's going to dig himself out of a hole in this next... [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1378.66s)]
*  There's going to be another debate, right? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1380.46s)]
*  They asked... [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1381.58s)]
*  Trump's team hasn't agreed to it yet. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1382.78s)]
*  I think they should, to be honest. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1384.7s)]
*  Oh, they need it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1385.86s)]
*  I think they should. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1386.46s)]
*  Are you sure it wasn't the other way around? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1387.7s)]
*  No, Kamala immediately said, let's do a second. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1389.46s)]
*  OK, there was something on the 25th that was supposed to happen. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1391.98s)]
*  But let's see. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1393.98s)]
*  Because she knew she won. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1394.66s)]
*  So the smart move is to be like, we want a second election. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1395.54s)]
*  And his handlers are going to be... [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1398.06s)]
*  Or a second debate. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1399.18s)]
*  And his handler is going to be like, whoa, we don't want a second debate. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1400.02s)]
*  But a second debate where he's prepped. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1402.34s)]
*  Because her policies, she has no policies. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1404.26s)]
*  The past four years, nobody's really happy with. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1406.98s)]
*  What policies? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1410.02s)]
*  I mean, like she has some policies. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1410.74s)]
*  What are they? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1412.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1412.94s)]
*  All of them, but they're on her website. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1413.8600000000001s)]
*  And she did... [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1415.58s)]
*  She did not have them on her website for weeks. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1416.94s)]
*  As somebody who's like, I don't have a real horse in either one in this race. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1419.46s)]
*  I'm cool with whatever. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1425.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm looking at her website being like, give me something. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1426.94s)]
*  And it wasn't there for weeks. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1429.26s)]
*  And it's like, buddy, this is the bare fucking minimum. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1430.7s)]
*  Give me some policies. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1434.6200000000001s)]
*  One that really resonated amongst people, I was watching at a bar. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1435.8600000000001s)]
*  And it was actually a mixed crowd. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1439.46s)]
*  There was some conservatives there as well. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1440.54s)]
*  The 15,000, I think, tax credit. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1443.38s)]
*  $50,000 start up. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1446.66s)]
*  $15,000 for a child. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1447.6599999999999s)]
*  $6,000, yes, sorry. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1450.2199999999998s)]
*  That one resonated amongst everyone. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1451.8999999999999s)]
*  Even the conservatives like, yeah, that's good. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1453.9799999999998s)]
*  So that one hit. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1456.62s)]
*  Give people money. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1458.4199999999998s)]
*  They both have policies on their website. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1459.26s)]
*  No, but Kamala just added them. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1461.4199999999998s)]
*  But at least she said it when asked. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1463.4199999999998s)]
*  Here's the reality. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1465.34s)]
*  He really didn't say anything. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1465.82s)]
*  Kamala's not going to do anything novel. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1466.7399999999998s)]
*  She's not going to do anything unique. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1468.7399999999998s)]
*  If Kamala wins, this could be more of the same. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1470.54s)]
*  This is the system that America has developed. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1472.8999999999999s)]
*  And this sounds very cynical. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1475.82s)]
*  Where you basically put two candidates up that both are in bed with the most powerful [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1477.7s)]
*  corporations of the country. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1486.02s)]
*  And those corporations make sure that they're still going to be able to suck off the tea [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1487.1399999999999s)]
*  to the government, which is essentially off the tea to the American people. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1490.82s)]
*  And both candidates will ensure that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1493.94s)]
*  Trump is the wrinkle in this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1496.8999999999999s)]
*  He's the person where he's like, these corporations go, I don't know if I'll be able to suck off [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1498.74s)]
*  that tea. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1503.78s)]
*  I might be able to. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1504.1s)]
*  And Trump might be looking at them like, no, you'll be able to. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1505.22s)]
*  Please, give me the opportunity. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1507.46s)]
*  Or he might go, fuck them. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1509.06s)]
*  I don't like these corporations. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1510.1000000000001s)]
*  But if you get Kamala in there, it's not going to be some crazy watershed moment for America. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1512.1000000000001s)]
*  It's going to continue. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1517.78s)]
*  Whatever's happening now will continue. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1518.98s)]
*  If your life is pretty good now, that seems like a good vote for you. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1521.06s)]
*  It will optically mean something. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1525.14s)]
*  Pardon? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1526.5s)]
*  It will optically mean something. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1526.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1528.18s)]
*  Optically. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1528.5s)]
*  But like, yeah, and actually that is important. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1529.14s)]
*  I think that was the Obama thing too, which is like, I think that was very important for [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1531.3s)]
*  people culturally outside of the fact that it was just more of the same politically. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1534.58s)]
*  But culturally, that was a big moment. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1539.6999999999998s)]
*  Maybe women are like, hey, we want a woman out here. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1541.62s)]
*  I think it's only the media that makes it seem like, oh, if one side wins, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1544.82s)]
*  it's going to be the end of this country. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1548.1s)]
*  Yeah, both sides. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1549.6999999999998s)]
*  I think all people understand like, things aren't going to change that much. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1550.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, Trump also said that. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1554.26s)]
*  He's like, they're destroying the country. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1555.78s)]

*  man. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1612.1000000000001s)]

*  We know that's a losing strategy. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1640.98s)]
*  Instead of inspiring people to vote for you, being like, you can't vote for that person. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1642.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1646.66s)]

*  At least I do. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1698.5s)]

*  How the fuck are you going to do it? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1709.94s)]
*  He just says these boring things. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1711.06s)]
*  I will say that worked for him in 2016. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1713.46s)]

*  And so I think this is just like a regular crackhead psycho that just like attacked a cat. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1817.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1822.5s)]
*  Let's have some fun. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1823.38s)]
*  Please, please. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1825.14s)]
*  Let's have some fun. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1826.02s)]
*  Why don't more people eat geese and stuff? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1828.9s)]
*  I always think that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1831.78s)]
*  Every time I order duck at a restaurant and I also go see ducks in a pond, I took Shiloh to go see ducks. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1833.46s)]
*  I'm looking at all these ducks and I'm just like, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1840.98s)]
*  I could just take one of these fucking ducks. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1845.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's just free food in the lake. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1847.06s)]
*  There's free food everywhere. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1848.42s)]
*  I'm actually baffled it doesn't happen more. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1851.22s)]
*  That's true. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1854.26s)]
*  No. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1854.9s)]
*  What's the species of duck that's peaking? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1855.54s)]
*  Peaking is a way of preparing. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1859.3s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1862.82s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1863.06s)]
*  But I mean, what species do they use to make that duck? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1863.46s)]
*  That one? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1866.02s)]
*  The ones in the pond. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1866.34s)]
*  Do you know that though? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1867.54s)]
*  Do you really know? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1868.58s)]
*  How many ducks are there? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1869.22s)]
*  How many ducks are there? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1870.18s)]
*  I think there's a mallard. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1871.06s)]
*  Different ducks, bro. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1871.7s)]
*  There's a mallard. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1872.5s)]
*  Dude, I was right. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1873.14s)]
*  There's a Mandarin duck. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1873.86s)]
*  I mean, that's convenient. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1876.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1877.22s)]
*  That's why I said being racist. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1877.62s)]
*  And turns out I fucking nailed it. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1879.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1880.9s)]
*  But in all seriousness, I feel like you guys... [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1881.22s)]
*  They're really pretty. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1883.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1884.74s)]
*  I'm not getting any reaction out of you guys. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1885.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, say it different. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1890.26s)]
*  Say it different. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1891.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1891.62s)]
*  And the reaction can be negative or positive, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1893.3s)]
*  but I feel like there's no reaction. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1895.78s)]
*  What I'm asking is we buy food at the supermarket or restaurants. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1897.78s)]
*  We buy duck, right? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1902.58s)]
*  We buy it, right? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1904.02s)]
*  And there's ducks at the pond, right? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1906.34s)]
*  But we don't just take those. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1910.58s)]
*  Let me ask you like this. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1912.58s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1913.54s)]
*  Because he said I'm not getting any reaction out of you guys. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1913.78s)]
*  I thought he meant like we weren't bringing it on the political angle. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1915.78s)]
*  Like he was criticizing. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  And I was like, what's happening? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1919.86s)]
*  And then he's like, Mike, insane theory. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1920.98s)]
*  You're not responding. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1923.62s)]
*  Is that insane? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1924.58s)]
*  I guess I didn't... [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1925.3799999999999s)]
*  Ducks aren't FBA, bro. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1926.1799999999998s)]
*  I thought it wasn't insane enough. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1926.82s)]
*  It makes sense to be honest with you, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1929.22s)]
*  but I also don't know if you can just be in the park killing... [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1930.98s)]
*  Let me phrase it like this. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1932.98s)]
*  Let me phrase it like this, right? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1933.86s)]
*  You live in nature, right? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1935.06s)]
*  And there's an apple tree right there. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1936.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1938.6599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1939.06s)]
*  There's also apples at the grocery store. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1939.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1941.22s)]
*  Now me, knowing me, I would go to the apple tree [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1942.6599999999999s)]
*  and I would pluck an apple out of the apple tree [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1945.9399999999998s)]
*  and then I would make my apple with honey or whatever. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1947.9399999999998s)]
*  None of that is true. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1950.58s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1951.3s)]
*  You wouldn't do any of that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1951.78s)]
*  You would have Uber Eats get you the apple from a... [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1953.62s)]
*  If I'm being honest with you. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1955.46s)]
*  You'd be like, Tony, give me an apple. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1956.4199999999998s)]
*  It's too much work. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1957.78s)]
*  To be totally honest with you, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1958.58s)]
*  we got two apple trees on the property in the Hamptons. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1959.54s)]
*  I haven't eaten one of them apples the whole summer. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1962.34s)]
*  But... [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1964.4199999999998s)]
*  You shouldn't. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1964.6599999999999s)]
*  They're delicious. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1965.06s)]
*  But I have eaten the tomatoes from the garden. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1965.9399999999998s)]
*  But you used apples. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1970.6599999999999s)]
*  You didn't eat the fucking apples. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1971.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1973.8600000000001s)]
*  It was probably a bad choice. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1975.3s)]
*  And you didn't pick any of them. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1975.94s)]
*  That was a bad choice. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1977.06s)]
*  Someone got to pick them. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1977.8600000000001s)]
*  No, no, we picked them. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1979.14s)]
*  My wife picked them. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1980.42s)]
*  You had a mic in your arm again. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1981.06s)]
*  I made my wife go pick them for you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1982.18s)]
*  So you didn't pick them. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1982.98s)]
*  Go pick me some tomatoes. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1983.3s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1985.06s)]
*  So that's the same as sending her to the supermarket pretty much. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1985.46s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1987.8600000000001s)]
*  My point is... [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1988.82s)]
*  I think it's because they're in parks [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1990.26s)]
*  and you can't just be in parks killing these animals. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1991.46s)]
*  They're probably protected species. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1993.3s)]
*  Okay, so that's what would... [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1995.22s)]
*  They're a protected species? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1997.14s)]
*  Yeah, like Central Park isn't an actual forest. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=1997.94s)]
*  I feel like it's an invasive species. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2000.1s)]
*  Well, their shit is invasive. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2001.9399999999998s)]
*  No, they're protected. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2003.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2004.34s)]
*  Geez up, dude. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2006.6599999999999s)]
*  Basic federal law that protects birds and their habitats. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2007.6999999999998s)]
*  So we all found this out right now. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2010.58s)]
*  None of us... [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2012.02s)]
*  What I'm saying is... [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2012.98s)]
*  I mean, there's no ducks walking around Chinatown. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2013.62s)]
*  There's nothing walking around. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2017.6999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2019.06s)]
*  There's nothing walking around Chinatown. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2019.9399999999998s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2021.9399999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2023.2199999999998s)]
*  There's no straight pigeons. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2024.02s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2024.98s)]
*  There's no straight dogs. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2025.6999999999998s)]
*  Rats-free. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2026.58s)]
*  Can I just say this? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2027.54s)]
*  He's not talking about invasive species. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2028.42s)]
*  The Chinese are hearing all this stuff about the Haitians and they are straight. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2030.26s)]
*  They say, do not say a word. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2036.8200000000002s)]
*  Let them get their smoke. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2039.54s)]
*  Let them focus on them voodoo motherfuckers because if they even look over here, it's a problem. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2041.7s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2046.9s)]
*  It is a problem. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2047.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that Peking Duck is a species of duck. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2048.98s)]
*  I think that shit is a cat, to be honest with you. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2051.78s)]
*  No, it could be a cat. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2053.78s)]
*  It could be a cat. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2055.06s)]
*  There's a lot of things it could be. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2056.34s)]
*  My point is that I do find it peculiar that we are judging these people for just taking the food [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2057.7s)]
*  in the pond. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2067.06s)]
*  Why is some food allowed to just be in the pond and then other food not? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2067.94s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2071.86s)]
*  There's a whole subculture of people eating roadkill. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2072.74s)]
*  You ever heard of this? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2074.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2075.3s)]
*  Mark, that's fucking disgusting. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2076.18s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2077.54s)]
*  That's a dead animal. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2078.34s)]
*  It's a carcass on the side of the road run over by a Jeep Wrangler. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2079.94s)]
*  No, it basically like there's people you call them. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2082.98s)]
*  You're like, hey, I just saw a deer. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2085.14s)]
*  It just got hit two minutes ago. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2086.42s)]
*  He'll pull up in three minutes, pick up the deer while still breathing, cut the neck, take it home. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2088.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a different situation. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2092.7400000000002s)]
*  Who's he on the phone with? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2093.7000000000003s)]
*  RFK. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2094.1800000000003s)]
*  They'll be right there. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2096.9s)]
*  I'm just saying this guy right here, he has a satchel. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2097.94s)]
*  He's going to work. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2102.66s)]
*  He's in a big geek squad. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2104.42s)]
*  Our neighbor from Miami. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2105.3s)]
*  What were those big birds that were walking around with? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2107.38s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2109.06s)]
*  How do we know you're not trying to save the bird? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2110.02s)]
*  Can I tell you something else? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2111.62s)]
*  I'll tell you for a fact. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2112.66s)]
*  The bird was injured. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2113.54s)]
*  Can I tell you how I know? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2114.34s)]
*  When we lived in Miami and we lived in a neighborhood where people were eating all the animals in the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2116.02s)]
*  neighborhood. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2120.18s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2120.74s)]
*  We went to a cookout and they served us. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2121.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not even a question in my mind because you would hear the birds going, cook out, cook out. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2123.2999999999997s)]
*  It would happen regularly. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2135.3799999999997s)]
*  I didn't judge them. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2138.18s)]
*  That's how you knew it was going to wake up. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2139.2999999999997s)]
*  It's food. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2140.74s)]
*  That was our rooster. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2141.14s)]
*  Is it food? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2142.18s)]
*  But they're not protected in Miami. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2144.42s)]
*  Probably like they're protected. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2145.86s)]
*  Can I just say one thing? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2146.98s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2148.02s)]
*  We never knew about the protection. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2148.5s)]
*  We never knew about protection. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2151.14s)]
*  I don't know about animal protection. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2152.74s)]
*  I just knew you don't eat the ducks. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2154.2599999999998s)]
*  But nobody told me there was an animal protection act or a duck flying act or whatever the hell [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2156.82s)]
*  these things are. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2160.42s)]
*  I just knew if you let me see animals, I'm probably not supposed to eat them. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2162.66s)]
*  I knew that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2166.58s)]
*  That's just something I innately knew. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2168.02s)]
*  I think it is possible that there are certain species of human being that do not have that [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2170.42s)]
*  primal instinct. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2174.82s)]
*  They have a primal instinct where if you see food, finders keepers. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2176.58s)]
*  That I think is the real primal instinct. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2180.5s)]
*  You don't have the problem. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2182.98s)]
*  Yeah, I have this like human instinct. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2183.94s)]
*  It's been like my primal instincts have been neutered. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  I've been cocked by the government. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2189.78s)]
*  They dangle food out in front of us. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2192.42s)]
*  They go, look at inflation. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2194.5s)]
*  Inflation is 100% but you can't have that duck. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2195.78s)]
*  There's a perfectly good dog right there in the street. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2197.6200000000003s)]
*  There's a whole park of dogs. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2200.3399999999997s)]
*  I could go to a dog park with a fork if I wanted to. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2201.54s)]
*  But no, the government keeps you dumb. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2205.54s)]
*  They put fluoride in your water and now you don't even know you can eat the dog. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2206.98s)]
*  I don't even know I can eat it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2209.3799999999997s)]
*  So this is something that we need to discuss. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2210.8999999999996s)]
*  And I think there should be a little less judgment. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2215.14s)]
*  You know how like when the Muslim immigrants in Europe come and you got to teach them not [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2217.2999999999997s)]
*  to rape women. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2222.02s)]
*  You got to teach them. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2224.2599999999998s)]
*  You got to take them to school and be like, hey, you can't rape women. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2225.62s)]
*  Please. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2229.62s)]
*  And they're like, look, you can see their forearms. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2230.66s)]
*  But you can't do it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2234.8199999999997s)]
*  And they're, okay, okay, okay. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2236.2599999999998s)]
*  I want to. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2237.54s)]
*  But I want to. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2238.3399999999997s)]
*  But you can't. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2239.14s)]
*  You're not allowed. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2240.9s)]
*  These are pure German women. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2242.9s)]
*  What do I do instead? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2244.58s)]
*  You got to get a job. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2246.2599999999998s)]
*  You can stack the meat and then shave it or whatever you guys do. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2247.62s)]
*  You got to do something but you can't. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2251.8599999999997s)]
*  The women here. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2254.98s)]
*  Can I trick kids with ice cream and make them think they're eating it? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2255.7799999999997s)]
*  We love that game. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2258.34s)]
*  We love that. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2259.78s)]
*  That is a really fun game. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2261.1400000000003s)]
*  The cone inside the cone and then you switch it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2262.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, obviously we're mixing Middle Eastern countries. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2265.06s)]
*  I don't think the Turkish have that problem. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2267.7000000000003s)]
*  But still, we like that game. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2269.2200000000003s)]
*  That's good for you. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2270.7400000000002s)]
*  But the women, what is that? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2271.86s)]
*  What is that? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2273.46s)]
*  Good. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2274.34s)]
*  No. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2274.98s)]
*  We got to try it again. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2275.94s)]
*  The thing to do. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2279.06s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2281.86s)]

*  Sorry. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2284.1000000000004s)]

*  You take a few lessons. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2285.8s)]
*  You got to, yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2286.8999999999996s)]
*  Nine means nice. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2288.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2290.8199999999997s)]
*  Years old? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2291.3199999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2292.18s)]
*  God. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2293.3799999999997s)]
*  No matter what your book says, you cannot do it. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2293.8799999999997s)]
*  No matter what the book says, you cannot do it. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2297.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2301.14s)]
*  Not here. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2302.58s)]
*  Not in Germany. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2305.22s)]
*  So they did that. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2305.4599999999996s)]
*  They went through that process where they slowly indoctrinated them with this idea that you cannot win it on the street. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2306.3399999999997s)]
*  Do it in your nightclub. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2313.14s)]
*  What? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2314.2599999999998s)]
*  Mark. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2316.02s)]
*  That's one of those BDSM clubs. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2316.82s)]
*  No. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2318.34s)]
*  No. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2319.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2320.9s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2321.4s)]
*  Because you can't go to the nightclub because they got alcohol. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2321.78s)]
*  So you got to find another place to do it. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2324.34s)]
*  You got to do it somewhere else. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2327.54s)]
*  They always get you. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2328.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2329.7s)]
*  That process, that didn't happen overnight. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2330.74s)]
*  Teaching Muslim immigrants how to not rape white women in Europe. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2334.26s)]
*  That doesn't happen here. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2338.58s)]
*  You think that happens in 24 hours? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2340.26s)]
*  That takes weeks of training and schooling and propaganda. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2342.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2352.1s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2353.7s)]
*  You think that immigrants coming here are going to see a perfectly good mallard? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2354.42s)]
*  It's true, dude. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2360.98s)]
*  They come from places where there's not a lot of food. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2362.34s)]
*  That's why they're here. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2363.94s)]
*  And yeah, we just got food protected. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2365.22s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2367.46s)]
*  It is actually on some levels insulting. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2368.1s)]
*  It's immoral on some levels. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2371.46s)]
*  They're coming here, they're starving. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2373.38s)]
*  They've got their bags. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2375.46s)]
*  The streets paid with golden food, bro. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2376.82s)]
*  That's the gold they're talking about. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2378.98s)]
*  But they're like, don't touch. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2380.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2381.7s)]
*  Grass, we're not going to grow anything on it. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2382.42s)]
*  Animals, we can't eat. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2384.5s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2385.62s)]
*  I'm insulted. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2386.26s)]
*  Really makes you understand how the Muslims are feeling. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2386.98s)]
*  That makes sense to me. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2390.66s)]
*  I'm missing it. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2391.86s)]
*  Keep talking to me. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2392.5s)]
*  There's food out on the streets and I can't eat. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2393.06s)]
*  Got it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2394.74s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2395.3s)]
*  Now I get it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2396.1s)]
*  I get it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2396.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2397.3s)]
*  So that's all I'm saying. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2398.1s)]
*  So we got to teach everybody. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2399.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2401.06s)]
*  That's on us. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2401.46s)]
*  There needs to be a government program. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2402.1s)]
*  That is on us. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2403.62s)]
*  Yo, our bad. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2404.18s)]
*  Our bad. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2405.22s)]
*  We should have been more forthcoming with that information. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2406.58s)]
*  If we're going to invite cultures here, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2408.5s)]
*  we have to understand what's normal where they're from. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2410.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2412.9s)]
*  Your boy barbecue, Mark. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2414.18s)]

*  Sapace. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2417.7799999999997s)]
*  Barbecue. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2418.9s)]
*  Maybe the current leader of Haiti. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2419.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2421.22s)]
*  Eats human beings. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2423.62s)]
*  You think he's going to bat an eye at a goose on the street? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2427.06s)]
*  Yeah, they came to America being like, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2429.54s)]
*  yo, we're going to really tone it down. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2430.9s)]
*  We're not going to eat. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2432.1800000000003s)]
*  We're only going to eat dogs and ducks. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2432.9s)]
*  Yeah, if I see an easy to catch goose, I'm going to catch it. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2435.06s)]
*  And I'm going to take it over here. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2437.3s)]
*  I'm not going to eat a human here. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2437.94s)]
*  Not here. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2439.2200000000003s)]
*  Can't do that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2440.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2441.62s)]
*  We're in America. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2442.1800000000003s)]
*  Maybe that's what Trump was saying. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2443.14s)]
*  Maybe that was his policy. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2444.1800000000003s)]
*  They're eating cats and dogs. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2445.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to put a stop to it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2446.34s)]
*  I'm going to teach them. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2447.46s)]
*  We're going to indoctrinate them. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2448.5s)]
*  Maybe that's what he was trying to say. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2449.7000000000003s)]
*  But the fucking moderators. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2450.82s)]
*  The bias moderators cut him off. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2452.34s)]
*  C-Spa run. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2454.02s)]
*  He was running from a hater. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2454.7400000000002s)]
*  That is actually true. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2456.6600000000003s)]
*  That's what the book's about. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2457.7799999999997s)]
*  But that is insulting of us, right? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2458.74s)]
*  To not recognize another culture. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2460.8999999999996s)]
*  Just assume that they're going to be fluent in ours. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2462.5s)]
*  I think that we have to stop doing that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2466.1s)]
*  Let's teach them. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2467.46s)]
*  OK? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2468.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2468.5s)]
*  Dogs. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2468.8999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2469.7799999999997s)]
*  Can you eat them? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2470.02s)]
*  No. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2471.2999999999997s)]
*  Cats. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2472.1s)]
*  No. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2473.2999999999997s)]
*  You cannot eat cats, Mark. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2474.74s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2476.02s)]
*  Not enough meat. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2477.54s)]
*  So it's more of a nutritional thing. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2478.98s)]
*  It's more of a nutritional thing. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2480.1s)]
*  There's just not enough meat. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2481.14s)]
*  Rabbits. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2482.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2483.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2484.18s)]
*  Well, that's a pet also. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2484.66s)]
*  So if you like rabbits. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2485.62s)]
*  Also not much meat on a rabbit. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2485.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but you can eat it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2487.22s)]
*  That means you can eat it at a restaurant. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2487.9399999999996s)]
*  That's a Haitian delicacy. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2489.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2490.8199999999997s)]
*  That's one of the things. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2491.2999999999997s)]
*  Rabbits are totally fine. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2491.7799999999997s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2492.74s)]
*  Guinea pigs, yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2493.06s)]
*  But rabbits are pets. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2494.1s)]
*  So like how if you come over to America, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2495.2999999999997s)]
*  you're fobbing it up. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2497.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2499.06s)]
*  And you see a rabbit in a cage. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2499.54s)]
*  Horses are pets. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2502.5s)]
*  Doesn't mean you can't eat them. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2503.2999999999997s)]
*  Wild rabbit is fair game. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2504.58s)]
*  So what are you allowed to eat? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2505.8599999999997s)]
*  Wild rabbit. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2507.7s)]
*  Maybe fair game. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2508.58s)]
*  So if it's a rabbit with a name, you can't eat it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2509.7s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2511.62s)]
*  Let's take a break for a second because we're going to be in Vegas this weekend. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2512.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2514.8999999999996s)]
*  Got the show. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2515.62s)]
*  We got the UFC. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2516.34s)]
*  And we've got some drinking to do. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2517.3s)]
*  OK? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2519.38s)]
*  And you know what happens when you do some drinking? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2520.02s)]
*  When you do some drinking the next morning, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2522.5s)]
*  it just might be different than other mornings. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2524.82s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2527.6200000000003s)]
*  That's all I'm legally allowed to say. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2528.6600000000003s)]
*  It might be different than other mornings. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2530.7400000000002s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2532.34s)]
*  Not when Z-Biotics has got your back and your liver and your stomach. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2533.54s)]
*  OK? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2538.82s)]
*  Z-Biotics is the world's first genetically engineered pre-alcohol probiotic. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2539.2200000000003s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2544.58s)]
*  You know what it means. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2545.78s)]
*  You know exactly what it means. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2547.1400000000003s)]
*  That means before we get to drinking, we're going to get that Z-Biotic in the system. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2548.34s)]
*  Because when you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2552.98s)]
*  And it's this byproduct, not dehydration, that's to blame for your rough next day. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2556.82s)]
*  Z-Biotics is a probiotic drink that produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2561.38s)]
*  That's a G. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2565.6200000000003s)]
*  What the hell happened right there? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2566.02s)]
*  What was that? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2570.42s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2615.5400000000004s)]
*  Guys, sometimes some of you, God forbid, but it might happen, you might get injured [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2616.6600000000003s)]
*  because of the negligence or, I don't know, malfeasance. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2622.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if I use that word correctly of another person. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2625.1400000000003s)]
*  If you are injured because of the negligence of someone else, not you injured yourself, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2627.6200000000003s)]
*  like you bruised your rib trying to suck your own dick. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2631.3s)]
*  I'm sure some of you have done that. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2633.14s)]
*  But if you get injured because of the negligence of another person, that's hard. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2634.5s)]
*  You got to file the fucking all the proper paperwork. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2638.8199999999997s)]
*  You got to go with the insurance companies. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2642.3399999999997s)]
*  You got to do the hospital treatments and the rehab, whatever all that stuff is. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2643.7s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2646.42s)]
*  But one thing that is easy is filing a claim at Morgan & Morgan. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2647.06s)]
*  You can submit a claim to Morgan & Morgan, America's largest injury law firm, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2650.98s)]
*  who has recovered over $20 billion for over 500,000 clients. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2655.22s)]
*  Guys, that's a half a million people they've recovered money for. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2660.34s)]
*  That's not one case for $10 billion and 30 others making the other $10 billion. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2663.1400000000003s)]
*  This is 500,000 people who have been helped by them. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2667.2200000000003s)]
*  So, like I said, getting injured because of someone else's negligence is hard to go through. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2669.94s)]
*  But luckily, submitting a claim with Morgan & Morgan is easy. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2674.1800000000003s)]
*  So if you're ever injured, you can check out Morgan & Morgan. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2676.98s)]
*  This part is important. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2679.86s)]
*  Their fee is free unless you win. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2680.82s)]
*  That means if you lose, they don't take nothing. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2682.7400000000002s)]
*  They don't charge you. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2686.1000000000004s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2687.06s)]
*  They will only charge you if they win. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2687.94s)]
*  For more information, go to forthepeople.com slash flagrant [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2690.02s)]

*  Again, that is F-O-R-thepeople.com slash flagrant or pound law, pound 529 from your cell. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2697.3s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2707.62s)]
*  What about a fish? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2708.58s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2710.02s)]
*  What if it's in a tank? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2711.14s)]
*  That's too little. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2712.18s)]
*  You can't do nothing there. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2713.3s)]
*  You can eat a fish in a tank if you want to. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2714.2599999999998s)]
*  You might get kicked out of the dentist's office, but you can give it a rib if you want. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2716.02s)]
*  I think you can eat fish. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2720.5s)]
*  I think if you buy a fish, you can do whatever you want with it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2722.82s)]
*  If you want to eat it, if you want to do that prank where you swallow it and throw it back [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2724.66s)]
*  up and it's still alive. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2727.62s)]
*  Shout out David Blaine. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2728.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2729.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2729.86s)]
*  I think you can do whatever you want with a fish. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2730.5s)]
*  All right. Fair enough. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2732.18s)]
*  That is a good question because if you buy a dog and you eat it, that's illegal. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2732.9s)]
*  But if you buy a fish and you eat that, that's a magic trick. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2736.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2743.22s)]
*  You can do whatever you want with fish. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2743.62s)]
*  I think we feel very comfortable in the United States of America with that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2745.22s)]
*  Now, there are certain fish that aren't a certain size. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2747.7s)]
*  They have these size and weight limitations with fish. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2750.5s)]
*  You can't keep them and eat them if they're not big enough. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2753.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You got to throw them back. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2755.2999999999997s)]
*  You got to throw them back. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2756.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2757.06s)]
*  So that's where you have to spit it back up. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2757.7799999999997s)]
*  That's throwing it back. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2760.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2760.8999999999996s)]
*  Literally. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2761.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2761.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2761.7799999999997s)]
*  All right. What about a turtle? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2762.5s)]
*  Can you do a turtle? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2763.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Sure. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2764.2599999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2765.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, that seems kind of... [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2766.4199999999996s)]
*  I think age matters with a turtle. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2767.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like a 200-year-old tortoise. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2769.8599999999997s)]
*  That's fucking delicious. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2771.7s)]
*  I mean, that's vintage. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2774.66s)]
*  That's a vintage tortoise. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2775.8599999999997s)]
*  This is from the 1800s, bro. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2778.02s)]
*  Why are we making a big deal of this? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2779.94s)]
*  Like, I genuinely am kind of like... [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2784.5s)]
*  Eating someone's pet is crazy because it's someone else owns it and that's stealing. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2786.5s)]
*  It's almost like taking someone's bike. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2790.42s)]
*  It's more theft. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2791.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2792.42s)]
*  To be honest, if he didn't say, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2792.58s)]
*  and dogs, I wouldn't have a problem with it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2794.5s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2796.74s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2798.74s)]
*  I do believe that. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2800.1s)]
*  They're eating cats. Good riddance. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2800.74s)]
*  But it's other people's pets. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2802.1s)]
*  This is the iguanas of New York City. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2803.14s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2804.9s)]
*  There's another Haitian person who was like, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2805.54s)]
*  I was going to eat that and then they stole my cat. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2806.8999999999996s)]
*  So I'm pissed off. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2809.06s)]
*  That is one of those tricky situations. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2810.8199999999997s)]
*  Where it's like the mafia can't call the police to help. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2813.14s)]
*  They want to, but it's like you're also doing something illegal. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2817.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2820.74s)]
*  So that's theft. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2821.22s)]
*  You can't steal someone else's food or... [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2822.1s)]
*  Yeah, you just stole someone else's shit. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2824.66s)]
*  That's where it's fucked up. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2826.2599999999998s)]
*  But I believe eating a duck that you find in a pond, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2826.9799999999996s)]
*  I'm okay with that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2830.8999999999996s)]
*  Now, I understand it's wrong and it's not proper etiquette, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2832.8999999999996s)]
*  but I don't think it should be that much judgment. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2836.02s)]
*  I think that people feel it adds to the aesthetic of the park. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2838.98s)]
*  That's what you're fucking up. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2842.9s)]
*  You just need to tell them that once. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2843.94s)]
*  But can I be honest with you? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2845.22s)]
*  Squirrels fuck up the aesthetic of a park. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2846.1s)]
*  I like the squirrel. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2848.82s)]
*  I like the squirrel. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2849.54s)]
*  I like the squirrel. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2850.1s)]
*  It's kind of cute. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2850.74s)]
*  But also, what's the... [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2852.02s)]
*  One duck and two in New York. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2852.66s)]
*  We got to cull the population a little bit, I think. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2854.18s)]
*  It's too many. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2856.18s)]
*  I like the squirrels. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=2856.82s)]

*  But I guess we have some sort of jurisdiction over their exports. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3110.1s)]
*  I would imagine when it comes to China, because we're protecting them from China. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3115.7000000000003s)]
*  Like we're the last barrier of entry for China just not demolishing them. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3119.78s)]
*  So I wonder if that's that was her like half truth. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3123.78s)]
*  And it like there's a perfect example of like a half truth like, yeah, they sold it, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3128.26s)]
*  but you could have vetoed the sale. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3132.42s)]
*  Yeah, but also that's Trump to Trump could have defended that himself. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3134.34s)]
*  That's about Trump. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3137.54s)]
*  He did this. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3138.1800000000003s)]
*  He could have sold like the moderator might not step in. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3138.6600000000003s)]
*  One thing I thought the moderator, I don't know if this is true, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3141.3s)]
*  but Trump corrected the moderator at one point. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3143.46s)]
*  When the moderator corrected him and said, actually, violent crime is down. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3145.62s)]
*  According to FBI data, he said they excluded the biggest cities in that. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3148.82s)]
*  So that was where I was like, well, that's weird. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3153.2200000000003s)]
*  If that's true, why would they interrupt him with that? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3156.02s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3158.9s)]
*  Because I know it's down in New York and I believe it's down in LA. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3159.38s)]
*  I think it's up on the animal kingdom. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3163.2200000000003s)]
*  Do we look into that? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3164.7400000000002s)]
*  I was violent crime in the animal kingdom. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3167.2200000000003s)]
*  What about birds and fowls? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3170.02s)]
*  Yeah, they're getting fucked up. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3171.86s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3173.06s)]
*  The US does exert some export control on TSMC to sell to like Chinese company, Hawaii. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3173.78s)]
*  Hawaii. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3180.02s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3180.9s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3182.1000000000004s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3182.42s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3183.38s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3183.94s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3184.5s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3185.1400000000003s)]
*  Start a new company and they're just buying ships through this new company. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3185.38s)]
*  I think that's like I heard that. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3188.98s)]
*  I'm sure there's a way to like circumvent it. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3190.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3192.6600000000003s)]
*  But again, this is a perfect half truth from Kamala. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3193.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3196.5800000000004s)]
*  Where it's like not really, what is the joke you guys are laughing at over there? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3197.78s)]
*  My pronunciation of why why? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3201.54s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3203.3s)]
*  It's getting compromised. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3204.02s)]
*  While bombing for the rafters. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3206.1800000000003s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3207.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm bombed outside the club. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3208.34s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3211.6200000000003s)]
*  You guys were pronouncing it Huawei. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3213.38s)]
*  I thought we were all going to pile on. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3215.94s)]
*  Can somebody break down tariffs? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3224.9s)]
*  Don't those hurt us by us implying tariffs on other countries and then they're just going to [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3227.78s)]
*  sell us their goods for more and then those extra costs goes to us. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3235.14s)]
*  That is one way of looking at it. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3240.66s)]
*  The other way of looking at it is by applying those costs, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3243.06s)]
*  you would allow American companies to compete. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3247.14s)]
*  You disincentivize importing and then you incentivize American companies to build up, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3249.8599999999997s)]
*  make their own stuff, build up manufacturing. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3254.1s)]
*  Then the only way that let's say China, let's say for example it's like t-shirts. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3256.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to use round numbers. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3260.18s)]
*  Hey, we're going to put a 20% tariff on t-shirts. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3261.3799999999997s)]
*  They used to be $100. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3263.62s)]
*  Now they're $120. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3264.5s)]
*  So now it's $120 to get a t-shirt. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3266.58s)]
*  Well, in America, they start making t-shirts because they couldn't make them for less than $110. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3268.98s)]
*  But China made them for $100. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3274.42s)]
*  Problem. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3276.02s)]
*  Well, now that it's $120 for a t-shirt in China, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3276.58s)]
*  American companies go, well, shit, I can make one for $110. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3280.1s)]
*  So now we got t-shirts for $110. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3283.38s)]
*  Now China goes, well, fuck, the only way I can sell t-shirts to them is if I make it for less than $110. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3285.7799999999997s)]
*  All right, so now we got it for $105. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3291.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3294.2599999999998s)]
*  So now we're getting a $20 credit, I guess you could say, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3294.5s)]
*  and then they're taking $15 of that hit. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3299.62s)]
*  Not us. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3302.3399999999997s)]
*  Now this is not all industries because not all industries can compete with these imports. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3303.2999999999997s)]
*  So if you don't have an American industry that can now make the goods within that 20% range [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3308.3399999999997s)]
*  or whatever the tariff is, then that cost of good will just get put on the American citizen. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3314.66s)]
*  And doesn't it take a while? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3319.94s)]
*  Like if you just put a tariff on one particular thing, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3321.06s)]
*  doesn't it take a while to get industry started here? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3323.06s)]
*  Like by the time we actually see it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3325.54s)]
*  Depending on what it is. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3326.5s)]
*  T-shirts you can make and a fuck. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3327.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think it does. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3328.34s)]
*  But I would also think, because on the surface, that sounds like a good idea to me, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3329.2999999999997s)]
*  because I think middle America lost all the manufacturing, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3332.02s)]
*  and that's one of the big contributors to decaying. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3334.74s)]
*  This would essentially build it back up. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3338.34s)]
*  And even if it took time, you're going to build a factory that's going to make jobs. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3339.7799999999997s)]
*  Like it might take some years, but I do think long-term I like that idea. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3342.66s)]
*  That would be the idea. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3346.42s)]
*  I'm using really round numbers, and it might be so much cheaper to do things in China that even [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3347.2999999999997s)]
*  with a 20% tariff, it doesn't make sense in America. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3352.02s)]
*  But some people might spend a few more dollars on a shirt that's made in America [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3356.02s)]
*  than something made in China. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3361.14s)]
*  And there are issues with Chinese goods, especially when it comes to clothing. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3362.1s)]
*  Since they're made in such bulk and the communication is quite difficult, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3368.2599999999998s)]
*  there's a lot of times there's mistakes. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3372.2599999999998s)]
*  And that isn't an issue in America. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3374.98s)]
*  You're talking to someone who fucking speaks English, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3377.38s)]
*  knows what you're trying to do. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3379.78s)]
*  You can go to the factory and be like, yeah, that's the one I want. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3381.14s)]
*  You're not flying to China every time you have a new order. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3383.8599999999997s)]
*  So even though it's a little more expensive, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3386.98s)]
*  you won't have as many mistakes that you ultimately have to pay for, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3389.8599999999997s)]
*  so the cost might be even. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3393.62s)]
*  So that would be the argument for tariffs. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3395.22s)]
*  I'm sure there's a perfectly good argument against it that would convince us all as well. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3397.22s)]
*  I've seen people present it on Twitter as very cut and dry. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3404.74s)]
*  You charge more money for them, they just add to the cost of good. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3408.2599999999998s)]
*  It's more expensive for the American people. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3411.22s)]
*  I don't believe it's that cut and dry. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3413.14s)]
*  And it might not be as cut and dry as what we're saying, like he said, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3415.46s)]
*  but yeah, to me, in theory, that makes great sense. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3417.46s)]
*  We should bring manufacturing back to America. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3420.2599999999998s)]
*  But as is, we can't compete with sweatshops. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3422.66s)]
*  But guys, okay, listen, can we just hold on for a second? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3424.42s)]
*  There's all this discussion about the election. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3426.3399999999997s)]
*  And listen, at the end of the day, we are Americans. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3428.9s)]
*  Actually, it's not just Americans. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3431.62s)]
*  This is a global phenomenon. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3433.62s)]
*  Do we care about the election? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3436.66s)]
*  Sure. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3438.1s)]
*  But the other thing that we're thinking is how can we make money on it? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3439.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3442.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3442.66s)]
*  How can we be the aristocrats? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3442.9s)]
*  Yeah, the aristocrats make money on the election. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3444.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3446.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3446.7400000000002s)]
*  The military industrial complex, wow, you're in a different seat, makes money on the election. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3446.98s)]
*  Oh gosh, Alex, come back. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3450.5s)]
*  Yo, what happened to Agassi and Alex? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3451.46s)]
*  They're probably collecting their bags of money. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3452.66s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3454.1800000000003s)]
*  They found a way to make money on it. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3455.06s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is the most American thing and the most international thing [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3456.5s)]
*  is probably to find a way to profit off of elections. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3460.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, how can we do that? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3463.14s)]
*  The everyday man, the regular folk. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3464.1s)]
*  There's no way for us to do it. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3465.86s)]
*  Mark, I'm going to make you eat your words. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3467.14s)]

*  Let's go. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3480.74s)]
*  What are the odds? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3481.54s)]
*  For the election, Trump was the fit, not the election, before the debate, Trump was the favorite. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3483.2999999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3487.8599999999997s)]

*  And then what happened? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3488.9s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3489.94s)]
*  I haven't checked it just yet, but before it was, you put $100 on it and you're making shit, $192. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3490.66s)]
*  Fast fire. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3496.2599999999998s)]
*  That's sick. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3497.38s)]
*  It is sick, but has that changed? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3498.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3500.9s)]
*  I guess we got to see if anyone's eating dogs out there. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3501.46s)]
*  I mean, if they are eating dogs, maybe it continues to be a favorite, but if they're not, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3503.94s)]
*  well, maybe Kamel is up. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3507.62s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is Stake has got your back and Stake can help you do that. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3508.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3512.1800000000003s)]

*  But while we're gambling with our life, we should at least make some moolah. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3519.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3522.02s)]
*  I'm betting on both sides. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3522.26s)]
*  So no matter what, I lose. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3523.62s)]
*  It's a smart strategy. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3527.46s)]

*  That was before the party. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3728.68s)]
*  No, you were in that convo. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3729.64s)]
*  Yeah, you participated. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3731.48s)]
*  What was the last time you nutted, yo? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3732.68s)]
*  Al gets dumb when he doesn't nut. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3735.08s)]
*  Yeah, you got cum brain. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3736.68s)]
*  He does have cum brain. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3737.8799999999997s)]
*  I know. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3739.08s)]
*  I can tell. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3740.2s)]
*  He got cum brain. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3740.7599999999998s)]
*  I've been since Italy, by the way. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3741.7999999999997s)]
*  He stopped the whole podcast. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3743.3999999999996s)]
*  He stopped the whole... [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3745.56s)]
*  Guys, hold on. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3747.0s)]
*  Hold on, y'all. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3749.16s)]
*  Junkie buddy. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3749.96s)]
*  Yo, we did talk about it. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3750.52s)]
*  We did talk about it. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3751.72s)]
*  Beyonce and all that shit. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3752.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3754.12s)]
*  Y'all saw it in the beat. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3754.62s)]
*  Bro, that's crazy. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3755.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the only word he heard. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3757.24s)]
*  I feel vindicated because I need to bring his shit up. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3759.0s)]
*  I said last week on the pod all the time, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3761.0s)]
*  but there's at least seven days in between now. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3763.08s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3765.2400000000002s)]
*  I got a nut. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3767.1600000000003s)]
*  For you guys, most fair format for the next debate. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3768.1200000000003s)]
*  Or what should he agree to? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3771.88s)]
*  I like the fact that... [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3772.92s)]
*  I thought this was fine. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3774.04s)]
*  And actually, I don't want there to be an audience. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3775.96s)]
*  This isn't... [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3778.6s)]
*  I mean, it is a popularity contest, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3779.7200000000003s)]
*  but it's not like a who can kill and who can rile up the audience. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3781.56s)]
*  It's not a comedy contest. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3785.8s)]
*  This is literally just say the words and then we digest the words. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3787.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3790.84s)]
*  That's it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3791.24s)]
*  Okay, so same format, but it can't be... [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3792.36s)]
*  He's going to say it can't be this three on one that I just experienced last night. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3794.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3797.96s)]
*  So he's going to oppose... [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3798.2s)]
*  Stop lying so much. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3799.16s)]
*  What if each one can pick a moderator? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3799.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3801.0s)]
*  There's a board that selects if they can approve it or not. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3801.24s)]
*  I mean, if they both got to pick a moderator, that might be too messy. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3804.52s)]
*  But like, just both of y'all keep that shit in check a little bit. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3807.8s)]
*  But y'all... [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3811.16s)]
*  Trump wants this person. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3812.36s)]
*  Kamala wants this person. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3813.32s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3814.2s)]
*  They say Kamala was wearing earrings with a microphone in them. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3815.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3818.76s)]
*  That's a nice little way. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3819.2400000000002s)]
*  I did not see this one. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3820.6000000000004s)]
*  Microphone or earrings with a... [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3821.4s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3822.44s)]
*  This is a nice Twitter experience. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3823.0s)]
*  Not microphone. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3823.56s)]
*  Twitter. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3824.1200000000003s)]
*  Twitter conspiracy. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3824.2000000000003s)]
*  Speaker. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3825.08s)]
*  A speaker in them. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3825.56s)]
*  Yeah, like earbuds. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3826.44s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3827.48s)]
*  Oh, let me see this. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3827.96s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3829.08s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3829.6400000000003s)]
*  Honestly, if you ever had an earbud in your ear and be able to talk that long, that's impressive. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3830.2000000000003s)]
*  We've done shows where we have the earbud in. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3835.7200000000003s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3838.04s)]
*  The RFP or whatever the fuck? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3838.44s)]
*  Whatever the fuck it is. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3839.4s)]
*  And the in-ears? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3840.36s)]
*  RFP. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3841.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3841.8s)]
*  And it's hard to pay attention to what's going on and listen to a note. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3842.68s)]
*  And I don't believe it. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3847.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't believe this shit. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3848.9199999999996s)]
*  Honestly, if she did, I'ma vote for her for sure. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3850.12s)]
*  But they could be queuing her up while Trump is talking. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3852.12s)]
*  But even then, now you're not listening to what he's saying and you look a little confused. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3855.0s)]
*  They tell you the bar to stay right after. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3858.2s)]
*  So these are her earrings. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3859.7999999999997s)]
*  I believe they're made by Chanel. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3861.0s)]
*  She's worn them multiple times before. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3862.12s)]
*  With that being said, people are saying, oh, these earrings right here are the Nova H1 audio earrings. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3864.2s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3869.7999999999997s)]
*  And they're actually... [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3870.3599999999997s)]
*  People are fucking losers. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3871.32s)]
*  They're actually headphones. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3872.84s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3873.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, they're looking for any excuse to why Trump didn't lose. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3874.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, yo, stop being... [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3878.6000000000004s)]
*  They look objectively different. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3880.04s)]
*  Like, what are we even talking about? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3883.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't think it was an earpiece, but I can see why. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3884.6000000000004s)]
*  But just stop being... [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3888.76s)]
*  In this one, the one that's the actual speaker is just the brown thing, right? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3889.48s)]
*  The one that looks like a pearl or something. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3894.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think it connects behind the ear, too. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3895.32s)]
*  Who is the person that finds this stuff? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3897.3199999999997s)]
*  Are you just trying to disrupt things or do you have an actual mental illness? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3901.3999999999996s)]
*  It's the Russian government. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3904.2799999999997s)]
*  Something's wrong. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3905.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it could be that, too. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3905.72s)]
*  It's the Russian government. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3906.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3907.16s)]
*  It could be that, too. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3907.8799999999997s)]
*  No, that actually makes a lot of sense. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3908.68s)]
*  That makes more sense than anything. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3910.3599999999997s)]
*  But if your boy loses, it's like you're looking for anything. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3911.64s)]
*  Not that hard, dude. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3914.52s)]
*  I'm fucking with you. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3915.3999999999996s)]
*  There's people that look. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3915.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but Trump should have had an earpiece, too. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3917.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm saying, yo, bandage on the ear, headphone underneath. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3919.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3922.8399999999997s)]
*  AirPod, bang. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3923.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't milk the bandage that long. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3924.2s)]
*  He could have milked that shit for a minute. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3926.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3928.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3928.3599999999997s)]
*  Just make that his Nelly shit. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3928.8399999999997s)]
*  Just every time you see it, just got the shit on. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3932.2s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3934.52s)]
*  You know what? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3935.72s)]
*  This really made me wish Vivek had won the primary. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3936.2s)]
*  He's too brown to win a Republican primary, but I feel like... [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3938.9199999999996s)]
*  He loves this guy. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3941.7999999999997s)]
*  Nah, of course I love him. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3942.7599999999998s)]
*  He also just speaks too far above the average intellect. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3944.12s)]
*  Like, he can't dumb it down. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3947.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's a real issue. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3948.8399999999997s)]
*  It's going to be his... [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3950.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that's why he should be in an advisory or cabinet role. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3951.16s)]
*  Because he needs somebody that can basically teach him how to speak to sixth grade IQ. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3954.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3961.88s)]
*  That's how you speak to the country. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3962.6800000000003s)]
*  And he just doesn't know how to do it. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3964.6800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, it would be the same. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3967.0800000000004s)]
*  The things I like about Trump's policies, whatever, I feel like he would do that [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3968.44s)]
*  without going off the rails. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3971.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3974.6000000000004s)]
*  I just think you can't slash all of the institutions by that many people, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3975.0s)]
*  and the country still function. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3980.6800000000003s)]
*  Indians save money, baby. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3982.84s)]
*  That's what we do. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3983.88s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3984.44s)]
*  Someone pointed this out on Twitter, but this shit is kind of fire. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3985.64s)]
*  The comment just says, Trump's neck pussy looking crazy. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3988.92s)]
*  Nah, that's AI. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3996.52s)]
*  That's gotta be AI. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=3999.0s)]
*  That's gotta be AI. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4000.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, how does that happen? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4002.2000000000003s)]
*  I'll get delicious right now. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4003.16s)]
*  I know, right? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4004.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that shit look good. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4004.92s)]
*  I was about to get smart. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4006.44s)]
*  I was about to get clear-minded. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4007.4s)]
*  My Puerto Rican came out. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4009.7200000000003s)]
*  That's how I look at my lips. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4011.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4014.76s)]
*  Yo, look at that thing. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4015.48s)]
*  Oh, bro, you see this? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4017.56s)]
*  Taylor Swift's endorsed. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4020.04s)]
*  She endorsed. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4024.04s)]
*  I swear you did. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4025.16s)]
*  Oh, god damn. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4026.04s)]
*  Holy shit, that's crazy. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4027.2400000000002s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4028.68s)]
*  All right, so what's your hot take 30 minutes later about Taylor Swift endorsing? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4029.32s)]
*  Yo, what's your hot take? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4035.88s)]
*  Yo, mother, I'm about to make this a white thing. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4036.84s)]
*  Do you think she moves the needle? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4041.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4043.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4043.6400000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4047.4s)]
*  Man, these little bitches are falling for all that girl the hell. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4048.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4050.44s)]
*  Actually, after going to that concert, yeah. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4051.96s)]
*  But I also think- [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4054.2000000000003s)]
*  Look at the NFL's numbers last season. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4055.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4057.4s)]
*  She moves the needle, bro. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4058.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4059.2400000000002s)]
*  But actually, I don't think she- [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4060.6000000000004s)]
*  Sorry, go. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4061.48s)]
*  I was gonna change gears completely if you want to finish this up. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4062.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't think she's getting any Republican to vote for Kamala. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4065.0s)]
*  I actually don't even know if that's possible. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4069.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4071.64s)]
*  To get some of the Swift parties just with an endorsement. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4072.44s)]
*  But isn't this what we said- [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4074.68s)]
*  The people in the middle. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4075.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4076.44s)]
*  The undecideds. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4077.56s)]
*  I think that she- [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4078.04s)]
*  That's huge. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4078.68s)]
*  She might be convincing undecideds. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4079.24s)]
*  And that's huge. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4081.48s)]
*  And that is huge. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
*  That's the one. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4083.08s)]
*  This is what we talked about on Patreon, which I guess will come out after this, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4083.56s)]
*  but the Patreon we talked about where it's like, it's 40% and 40% already know exactly [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4085.96s)]
*  what they're gonna do. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4091.0s)]
*  That 20%-ish in the middle that's undecided, they can be swayed by the debate. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4091.64s)]
*  They can be swayed by Taylor Swift. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4097.24s)]
*  I think maybe debate plus Taylor Swift might be like, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4099.8s)]
*  Hi. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4102.52s)]
*  You just feel on some level more okay voting. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4103.24s)]
*  I think the only thing that mitigates her endorsement is that people, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4105.24s)]
*  at least from my opinion, already knew kind of what side she was on. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4107.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4111.24s)]
*  She has on-camera appearances talking about how much she doesn't like Trump. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4111.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4114.92s)]
*  And so I think to the average person is like, yeah, we know she's- [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4115.400000000001s)]
*  It's not a surprise. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4117.88s)]
*  If this was someone completely out of left field, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4119.400000000001s)]
*  like if Melania was like, hey, I'm endorsing Kamala, we'd be like, whoa, that's crazy. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4121.88s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4125.64s)]
*  I hear you. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4126.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's also a big statement not coming out in support for Kamala. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4127.64s)]
*  So it's like, what's her statement? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4131.96s)]
*  If she just stays silent, like we talked about in the discussion, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4134.52s)]
*  like if time of Kamala bombed and she didn't say anything, then I think that, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4137.24s)]
*  I don't know if that would go noticed, but the fact that she came out and said something, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4140.36s)]
*  people are like, all right, that means she did well. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4143.4800000000005s)]
*  And like, it just adds to the idea that she did well. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4145.24s)]
*  If you're undecided and you're like, who do I just want representing the country? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4148.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4152.76s)]
*  Because not saying something is also saying something when you have that much influence. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4153.16s)]
*  Can we talk about what a legend Dave wrote? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4157.64s)]
*  Can I pee real quick? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4159.32s)]
*  Show. Can you really quickly keep you go? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4160.84s)]
*  Pee, we're going to start talking about this because [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4165.16s)]
*  he timed this up perfectly. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4167.4800000000005s)]
*  They say, yo, there's a debate happening. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4168.52s)]
*  So I got some news to tell everybody. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4170.12s)]
*  I got some information to drop on the internet. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4173.32s)]
*  Second, that the whole world is talking about some other shit. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4175.24s)]
*  Yeah, this is G. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4177.8s)]
*  You know, but what's so interesting about this and like, I'm trying to be positive. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4178.52s)]
*  I'm trying to be understanding. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4185.96s)]
*  He fathered a kid out of wedlock. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4189.72s)]
*  Who's this? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4192.2s)]
*  Dave Grohl is the lead singer of the Foo Fighters. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4192.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4195.08s)]
*  He used to be the drummer for Nirvana. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4195.32s)]
*  He used to be the drummer for Nirvana. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4196.52s)]
*  But he has over the last 30 years been regarded as the greatest human being in history. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4197.8s)]
*  He still may be. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4207.32s)]
*  Which he still may be. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4208.04s)]
*  But meaning like everyone loves Dave Grohl. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4210.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4213.8s)]
*  He always does the right thing. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4214.2s)]
*  He is so lovable, so endearing, so charming. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4217.24s)]
*  In every interview, he's charming. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4220.44s)]
*  He'll bring the right person on stage and sing the song with them together. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4222.28s)]
*  He'll support everything he needs to support. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4225.64s)]
*  He's perfectly managed his celebrity. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4227.88s)]
*  To perfection. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4231.64s)]
*  He's one of the few incredibly famous people. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4232.92s)]
*  And there's a handful of them. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4236.04s)]
*  It's like Hayman Keanu Reeves. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4237.32s)]
*  Literally that. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4239.64s)]
*  Are the only incredibly famous people that everyone just seems to love. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4240.5199999999995s)]
*  Who I think you think is the same person. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4244.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4246.04s)]
*  I probably. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4246.28s)]
*  I thought that was Keanu Reeves. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4247.719999999999s)]
*  Staunch conservatives. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4250.12s)]
*  It's like, yo, the Matrix guy does music? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4251.4s)]
*  And he's nice, too. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4254.5199999999995s)]
*  But staunch conservatives love him. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4255.799999999999s)]
*  Staunch liberals love him. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4258.2s)]
*  Everybody loves this guy. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4260.2s)]
*  He is an all-around seemingly just great fucking guy. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4261.639999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4265.96s)]
*  There's another wrinkle to this story that I'll tell you in a bit. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4267.719999999999s)]
*  So yeah, just to catch up. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4270.599999999999s)]
*  Keanu Reeves fathered her baby. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4271.719999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he knocks up some other chick outside of his marriage. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4275.96s)]
*  Which is like, this is not at all in line with the perception of Dave Grohl. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4282.44s)]
*  Who happens to be married to the daughter of one of our teachers at UCSB. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4291.48s)]
*  And the opening, do you remember this? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4299.64s)]
*  The opening lesson, the teacher brought it up. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4301.72s)]
*  Love this guy. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4305.4800000000005s)]
*  He's the best guy. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4306.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, wow, everybody loves him. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4308.68s)]
*  Even the guy who's fucking, you know, his daughter's getting married. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4310.04s)]
*  He still loves him. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4313.240000000001s)]
*  Everybody loves this guy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4314.4400000000005s)]
*  So there's more going on. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4315.88s)]
*  Maybe his marriage isn't that great. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4317.4800000000005s)]
*  Maybe they're just kind of, you know, keeping it together for, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4319.08s)]
*  what is it, keeping up with the Joneses or whatever that term is. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4323.240000000001s)]
*  We don't know exactly what's going on. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4325.8s)]
*  Now, I don't think that this is the case, but I do think it is funny. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4327.16s)]
*  This happened immediately after kind of publicly beefing with Taylor Swift. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4331.0s)]
*  This is going to add to the lore that Taylor Swift is somehow some genius mastermind. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4335.639999999999s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4339.8s)]
*  Literally, he was on stage being like, yeah, we don't use AI when we sing, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4340.5199999999995s)]
*  unlike some performers or something. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4343.0s)]
*  And like took a shot of her. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4344.84s)]
*  You remember this? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4345.8s)]
*  And then she like took a shot back or something like that. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4346.84s)]
*  She's like, I sing all my own songs. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4349.08s)]
*  I'm still popping. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4350.5199999999995s)]
*  Da da da. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4351.24s)]
*  I don't remember the exact details, but basically they were going like, jaw in each other. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4351.72s)]
*  And then a month later, he's like, yeah, knock someone out. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4354.84s)]
*  My bad. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4358.68s)]
*  And he thinks she sent a honey pot. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4359.56s)]
*  She's a honey potter. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4361.08s)]
*  She sent a honey pot. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4362.04s)]
*  She sent the Dave Grohl honey pot package. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4363.16s)]
*  How does she do it? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4365.56s)]
*  How does Taylor always do it? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4366.4400000000005s)]
*  No, it is just ironic that like the second you go to Taylor, cosmically, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4368.28s)]
*  somehow it comes back. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4371.4800000000005s)]
*  I know, dude. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4372.04s)]
*  She needs to be stopped. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4372.76s)]
*  And like, she's just unstoppable. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4373.64s)]
*  Do we know who the mistress is? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4376.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is the mother of his child. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4379.0s)]
*  Let me find out though. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4380.28s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4381.8s)]
*  Did he go to Schwarzenegger with it and the home couple? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4383.32s)]
*  Was it the nanny or was he having a whole relationship on the side? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4387.72s)]
*  Let me find out. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4392.76s)]
*  So here's my question though. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4393.56s)]
*  Does this change the perception of Dave Grohl at all? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4395.88s)]
*  Probably a little. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4400.04s)]
*  I had nothing to know. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4401.08s)]
*  No, it definitely changed your perception. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4402.360000000001s)]
*  You know who he is now. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4403.8s)]
*  This guy's awesome. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4407.32s)]
*  He's a rock star. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4408.04s)]
*  I know him. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4410.6s)]
*  That's great. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4411.16s)]
*  I'm just saying like when you're known as kind of like if one of the Oasis brothers [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4411.88s)]
*  fathered a kid outside of wedlock, you'd be like, yeah, that's what they would do. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4415.88s)]
*  They're like kind of, you know, curmudgeony rock stars. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4419.64s)]
*  But when you're the nicest guy in the world who loves family and loves togetherness and [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4424.6s)]
*  all of a sudden, cheating on your girls, one thing, fathering a kid? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4429.4800000000005s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4437.08s)]
*  That's insanity. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4438.84s)]
*  I mean, he probably didn't want her to keep the kid. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4440.68s)]
*  But still you're nutting in a girl. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4443.0s)]
*  You have a whole family and a wife and you're no rubber nutting in a girl on the side. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4444.68s)]
*  So what I'm starting to wonder is like, do we have to look back at the way that we've [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4451.72s)]
*  perceived Dave Grohl as a marketing campaign that we've all fell for for years? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4457.88s)]
*  I think people need to stop upholding random people that they don't know as perfect deities, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4462.92s)]
*  that can do no wrong. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4469.64s)]
*  We just do this all the time where you just see a guy and you're like, that guy's perfect. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4471.0s)]
*  And then they do anything wrong and you're like, how could they do this to me? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4474.4400000000005s)]
*  But they also lean into that shit, Mark. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4477.8s)]
*  They lean into the character of I do everything right. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4479.64s)]
*  And that's my only issue is like, it's very easy to share the wrong things you do. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4482.280000000001s)]
*  And it's also very easy for you and your publicist to come together [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4486.360000000001s)]
*  and put marketing dollars behind how awesome and genuine and beautiful you are. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4489.320000000001s)]
*  And you might get an ego boost out of the whole world thinking you're the best guy in the world. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4495.16s)]
*  I think every famous person does this. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4500.36s)]
*  Every publicist is like, okay, go do the dog charity and we're going to sleek at the TMZ or whatever. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4502.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4506.28s)]
*  I think that's just the nature of what being a famous person is. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4506.84s)]
*  And so he just happened to take hold within the minds of the people. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4509.72s)]
*  And they were like, yeah, this guy is the greatest guy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4512.6s)]
*  And then I think it's on the people to be like, yeah, not every person is perfect. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4514.92s)]
*  I bet you this rock star that's been famous since he was 15 years old [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4519.08s)]
*  probably has done some fucking. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4522.6s)]
*  Also to be fair to him, he's not taking every photo op. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4523.56s)]
*  We just find the cool things he does, like bringing his son on stage to play the drums. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4527.0s)]
*  That was so cool. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4532.120000000001s)]
*  It wasn't his son, it was the. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4533.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the band member who died, they had his son play the drums. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4534.76s)]
*  It was, we watched the video. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4537.88s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4539.160000000001s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4539.8s)]
*  I'm like, go, go, go. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4541.4800000000005s)]
*  So I'm just, to Mark's point, yeah, a person is all things, not can be. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4542.68s)]
*  We all are all things. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4546.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4547.64s)]
*  Anybody could slip up, I guess. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4548.4400000000005s)]
*  They've been married 21 years. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4549.96s)]
*  I'm not saying that makes it acceptable, but if people slip up after a long time, it happens. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4552.04s)]
*  Yo, but slip up is like. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4556.44s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4558.68s)]
*  If he just cheated, it's one thing. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4561.4s)]
*  It is different. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4565.0s)]
*  It is different. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4567.4s)]
*  But you don't know if the condom broke. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4568.92s)]
*  I'm not defending the guy, but I'm just like. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4571.48s)]
*  In my experience, it's impossible to get pregnant. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4574.36s)]
*  So. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4576.68s)]
*  The amount of times. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4577.740000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4580.22s)]
*  The amount of times he would have to fuck this girl and nut in her. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4580.700000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4584.38s)]
*  For her to get pregnant is, you can't even count them. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4585.02s)]
*  You can't even count them. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4588.54s)]
*  He's like, you did IVF with your bitch. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4589.34s)]
*  You did. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4591.1s)]
*  One night stand, you didn't know how he was. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4592.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4594.3s)]
*  I don't even believe in one night stands. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4594.860000000001s)]
*  I don't believe in this. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4596.860000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, when the athletes get the girls pregnant all the time, I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4597.9800000000005s)]
*  They're fucking thousands of girls and nutting in them. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4602.46s)]
*  And then eight got pregnant. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4605.82s)]
*  They also have like the best sperm. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4607.34s)]
*  Objectively. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4609.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't even believe that. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4609.66s)]
*  No, I mean. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  All they eat is gummy bears. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4611.5s)]
*  It's the most athletic sperm. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=4612.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5390.240000000001s)]

*  So it's who? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5392.160000000001s)]
*  Tim Pools. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5392.88s)]
*  It's one of the people at Tenet Media. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5394.0s)]
*  Their involvement, I don't know the exact details. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5395.68s)]

*  Dave Rubin. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5399.6s)]

*  No, they didn't know, but they didn't bother to look into it. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5404.24s)]
*  They're getting crazy bags for doing shit that didn't deserve the crazy bag. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5408.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting $400,000 a month. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5412.88s)]
*  That's kind of crazy. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5414.8s)]
*  For four videos. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5415.5199999999995s)]

*  Yeah, come on. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5420.0s)]

*  Melissa Chen or whatever her name is, Lauren Chen, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5423.44s)]

*  Oh, wow. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5428.639999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5429.44s)]
*  I'm not sure, but listen, whatever. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5430.08s)]
*  Get your money. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5432.48s)]
*  Also, I don't think they changed their, by the way, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5434.24s)]
*  I don't think they changed their perspectives, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5436.4s)]
*  but I also don't think that was the goal of the campaign. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5438.16s)]
*  I think the goal of the campaign wasn't for them to spout out disinformation. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5441.44s)]
*  I think the goal of the campaign was for us, the American people, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5447.44s)]
*  to not trust any media. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5451.5199999999995s)]
*  Because if those four people are bought, who else is bought? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5455.599999999999s)]
*  So you think it was their goal to get caught? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5459.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't think they're upset at getting caught. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5461.6s)]
*  Because now I'm like, yo, who's putting the money up for rumble, bro? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5464.64s)]
*  Are we talking about Operation Mockingbird right now? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5468.400000000001s)]
*  The greatest CIA operation ever. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5471.12s)]
*  Talk to me about that. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5472.8s)]
*  Basically, the CIA from declassified documents. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5473.84s)]
*  The CIA had basically put money towards independent journalists [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5476.88s)]
*  and media figures to basically buy their influence. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5481.280000000001s)]
*  Well, well, well. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5483.92s)]
*  From declassified documents. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5486.88s)]
*  They bite and all shit. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5489.12s)]
*  Once again. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5490.799999999999s)]
*  So let's think about it. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5492.0s)]
*  Who's putting the money up for rumble? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5494.0s)]
*  Rumble is clearly giving an outlet for, I would say, the most divisive voices online. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5496.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't even need to pay them to say the things they're saying. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5506.16s)]
*  All you need to do is amplify the voices that are saying these things [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5509.84s)]
*  and give them a platform. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5514.639999999999s)]
*  Because what you want is just disruption in America. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5516.16s)]
*  You just want people fighting. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5519.52s)]
*  You want people saying crazy shit and reacting to crazy shit. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5521.200000000001s)]
*  And make it seem like everybody here is at each other's throats. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5524.080000000001s)]
*  That's what you want. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5527.120000000001s)]
*  And it really doesn't cost that much for a country. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5528.080000000001s)]
*  We're talking about a country here. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5530.88s)]
*  If a country is just like, all right, shave off a billion dollars. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5532.88s)]
*  Russia's like, hey, listen, shave off a billion dollars of our new oil profits. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5535.68s)]
*  And just sow some disinformation in America. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5540.320000000001s)]
*  Prop up a bunch of these streaming platforms. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5543.92s)]
*  Possibly a bunch of these, I don't know what you even call rumble. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5546.24s)]
*  I guess it's streaming, but it's also videos. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5549.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5554.0s)]
*  I don't know where Tucker's at. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5554.5599999999995s)]
*  Tucker's so egregious with it. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5556.88s)]
*  Didn't he do an entire video talking about how great Russia was? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5558.4s)]
*  That's the only reason I'm like, I don't know if they're propping him up [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5560.48s)]
*  because he literally was there saying how amazing a Russian grocery store is. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5563.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5567.2s)]
*  That would be two on the nose. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5567.92s)]
*  But maybe. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5569.92s)]
*  Who's the money behind? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5571.599999999999s)]
*  I want to know where the money is. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5573.2s)]
*  But the fact that I want to know might be the point of the campaign. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5574.64s)]
*  It was just really interesting to see independent media [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5581.04s)]
*  within a few years completely discredit itself. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5586.0s)]
*  We were so excited about independent journalism [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5590.08s)]
*  until they got the taste or independent journalists got the taste of money. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5593.360000000001s)]
*  And they immediately leaned into whatever gets them the most views and the most money, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5598.240000000001s)]
*  which is exactly what CNN does and Fox News does. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5603.04s)]
*  It took a matter of years before greed completely manipulated free media. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5605.5199999999995s)]
*  I wonder if it's cheaper. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5610.48s)]
*  I wonder if the money it takes to buy a CNN or to buy a Fox [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5612.4s)]
*  is so much more than paying 100 independent people. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5616.96s)]
*  Of course. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5620.8s)]
*  And much less dangerous because CNN and Fox got to vet you a little bit [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5621.44s)]
*  because they're on the hook with their publicly traded companies. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5625.5199999999995s)]
*  So they're on the hook with their people on the stock, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5629.76s)]
*  people on the shares. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5632.08s)]
*  And if it looks like they're corrupted, forget it, game over. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5633.12s)]
*  My understanding is that Fox would have won that dominion lawsuit [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5637.92s)]
*  like if it actually went to court. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5641.36s)]
*  But Rupert Murdoch and the other top brass at Fox would have to take the stand [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5643.44s)]
*  and admit that they push out propaganda and that it's sensationalized. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5649.2s)]
*  And that would tank the company. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5653.92s)]
*  And that is worth way more than $800 million. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5656.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5659.28s)]
*  So they're like, fuck, they got us by the balls. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5660.48s)]
*  Okay, give them $800 million because we'll maintain Fox, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5662.72s)]
*  which is a billion dollar franchise. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5665.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5666.88s)]
*  But it's way cheaper to buy them off. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5669.04s)]
*  You're paying 100 grand a video and then they'll say whatever they're already saying. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5671.36s)]
*  Again, I don't think that... [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5674.96s)]
*  Tell me where I'm wrong in this. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5675.679999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5676.96s)]
*  Because they're saying what they're... [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5677.5199999999995s)]
*  They're all saying like we didn't know we're victims. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5678.4s)]
*  Tell me where I'm wrong. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5680.48s)]
*  Is it not worse that you're just saying what you believe [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5681.599999999999s)]
*  and Russia is using that to be like, oh, this is perfect propaganda for us? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5684.88s)]
*  Like if you're so American and what you're saying is something [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5689.44s)]
*  that Russians are looking at and being like, oh, this is great for us. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5692.32s)]
*  This is going to ruin America. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5694.8s)]
*  Is that not worse? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5696.88s)]
*  I would almost rather you be for saying that. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5698.08s)]
*  Here's the reason why I think it's worse is because [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5699.36s)]
*  that assumes everything America does is good. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5701.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5705.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5705.92s)]
*  And everything Russia does is bad. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5706.24s)]
*  And I don't exactly think that's the case when it comes to maybe the Ukraine-Russia war. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5708.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5713.679999999999s)]
*  People will be pointing out like, oh, we're giving $50 billion to Ukraine in weapons. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5714.08s)]
*  This is stupid. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5718.0s)]
*  We should be helping people here. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5718.8s)]
*  That obviously helps Russia, but that is just like a foreign policy dispute [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5720.08s)]
*  that can go either way depending on... [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5723.52s)]
*  So they're cherry picking the things that help them [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5725.04s)]
*  as opposed to like everything you say. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5727.28s)]
*  And they're also utilizing things that help them in ways that [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5728.56s)]
*  the person saying it might not think initially. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5730.88s)]
*  But I don't know if that's necessarily like... [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5733.28s)]
*  But also... [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5735.2s)]
*  And weren't they told... [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5735.76s)]
*  Weren't some of them told what to say? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5736.72s)]
*  Because I saw there was one video where a guy was like, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5738.96s)]
*  oh, Ukraine's our enemy or some shit like that. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5740.96s)]
*  Yeah, Tim Fool had said on an earlier stream, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5743.28s)]
*  I don't know the exact date, but something to the effect of like Ukraine. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5746.08s)]
*  Ukraine is the enemy of America. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5748.8s)]
*  Yeah, there is no proof as of now that he... [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5751.36s)]
*  The only two people I think that they know for sure that knew were Lauren Chen [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5753.84s)]
*  and then whoever the other founders had. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5757.6s)]
*  She started it. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5758.8s)]
*  Her and her husband started the Tenement Media Company. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5759.6s)]
*  Her husband. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5761.76s)]
*  Got it. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5762.16s)]
*  So yeah, they're definitely spies. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5762.48s)]
*  And they're also from Canada. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5763.92s)]
*  And that's another thing that's fucking annoying. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5765.04s)]
*  It's just like, yo, mind your business, yo. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5766.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5769.04s)]
*  If you're from Canada, don't start a fucking media company in America. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5769.36s)]
*  I'm all about like all of you mind your fucking business. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5772.4s)]
*  When it comes to our politics, mind your fucking business. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5775.52s)]
*  Don't start a media company here. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5777.6s)]
*  Don't do that shit. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5779.4400000000005s)]
*  All right, mind your business. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5780.24s)]
*  Go talk about your shit. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5781.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5782.8s)]
*  I mean that. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5783.2s)]
*  Jump over, go talk about your shit. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5783.68s)]
*  But they should not pop them. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5785.2s)]
*  Say again? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5786.64s)]
*  They should not pop them. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5787.04s)]
*  That's what annoys me. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5787.76s)]
*  I mean... [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5788.64s)]
*  It was kind of annoying when Trevor Noah would talk to Americans about racism. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5790.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like, buddy, couldn't you like not walk down the street with your fucking... [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5793.92s)]
*  Like, yeah, you guys don't know anything about the country. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5798.88s)]
*  You haven't lived in Alabama. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5800.88s)]
*  You haven't lived in Arkansas. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5802.16s)]
*  You're using these places as punchlines. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5803.2s)]
*  But you don't know anything about them. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5804.72s)]
*  Like, it's just not... [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5805.84s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5806.96s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5807.4400000000005s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5807.76s)]
*  All of you. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5808.16s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5808.88s)]
*  You're just here to be famous. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5809.2s)]
*  And this is your way to be famous. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5810.4800000000005s)]
*  Your way to make money. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5811.6s)]
*  But shut up. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5813.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5814.56s)]
*  Like, it is getting a little bit annoying. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5815.2s)]
*  It is. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5819.04s)]
*  This is your choice. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5819.52s)]
*  You came here for fame. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5820.320000000001s)]
*  And this is the avenue of fame. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5821.68s)]
*  I would feel uncomfortable going to a foreign country and then shitting on half of it. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5824.08s)]
*  Like as my job every week. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5829.360000000001s)]
*  I would feel uncomfortable. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5831.4400000000005s)]
*  I would feel... [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5833.04s)]
*  And also, Americans were so self-loathing that we allow it to happen, which is hysterical. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5833.6s)]
*  That's a product of privilege, being self-loathing. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5840.08s)]
*  Of course. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5842.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5842.4800000000005s)]
*  That was a great point. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5843.04s)]
*  But if we went to another country and did it, they would fucking berate us. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5844.320000000001s)]
*  Imagine an American goes to England, puts on a weekly talk show where he shits on half of England. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5848.4800000000005s)]
*  And look at these poor fucking, what do you call them, yokels? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5853.04s)]
*  And they dumb motherfuckers up in Yorkshire. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5855.200000000001s)]
*  And he's an idiot. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5857.280000000001s)]
*  They would be riding in the streets. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5858.0s)]
*  Let's go do a daily show in Iran. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5859.68s)]
*  Let's do a daily show in Iran. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5861.280000000001s)]
*  Great fucking idea. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5862.88s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5864.0s)]
*  It's almost like comedians going to other countries and shitting on them every time they get there. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5864.64s)]
*  Well, I would think that I do it in a way that acknowledges... [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5868.64s)]
*  I'm very deliberate about the way I do it. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5873.6s)]
*  It's like, hopefully when I leave, those people there go, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5876.08s)]
*  wow, he really took some time to understand the culture and really figure out what's going on here. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5879.04s)]
*  That's a peculiar thing. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5885.28s)]
*  It's also like, this is a stupid way of saying it. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5886.64s)]
*  It's like my way of saying thank you for coming out. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5889.6s)]
*  That's my way of going, hey, I'm not just going to make this only about me. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5893.2s)]
*  I want you to know that I appreciate you guys being here and I appreciate your country. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5896.32s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not politically driven. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5901.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's not shitting on the politicians or... [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5902.56s)]
*  I'm not trying to get you to vote red or blue based on... [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5905.36s)]
*  I know you're fucking around. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5908.0s)]
*  But it is a good thing to bring up because I think that could be a reaction. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5908.8s)]
*  But I think the distinct difference is I'm doing it out of love. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5912.88s)]
*  I'm like, hey, I appreciate you guys being here and I want to let you guys know, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5916.32s)]
*  here are some jokes about you guys too. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5920.08s)]
*  When they're doing it here, they're doing it for money and fame. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5922.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're interested in these topics for sure. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5924.64s)]
*  But I imagine if someone was like, hey, can you guys not do that show? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5927.04s)]
*  And instead, I just want to make you an action superhero. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5929.68s)]
*  I think they'd be like, okay. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5931.52s)]
*  That's why Jon Stewart is the go. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5937.68s)]
*  But I don't think there's many people that would say no to that. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5938.400000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5941.200000000001s)]
*  You're giving me a hundred thousand for a eight minute video. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5943.04s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5945.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like shit on Iron Man. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5946.56s)]
*  That's the reason why I don't criticize them because I don't think they knew. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5949.92s)]
*  No, I do criticize. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5954.32s)]
*  I don't think that they knew. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5955.2s)]
*  And you don't go asking where the money comes from. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5956.96s)]
*  You're talking about the Tenant Media guys right now, right? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5959.44s)]
*  Not John Oliver, Trevor Noah. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5961.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5962.4s)]
*  The Tenant Media guys, you don't go asking where the money comes from. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5963.36s)]
*  We don't ask where the fucking money comes from. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5967.52s)]
*  We're going to do a sponsorship on this podcast today. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5969.2s)]
*  I haven't vetted any of these companies. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5972.4800000000005s)]
*  Bluechew could be owned by fucking China for all I know. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5975.68s)]
*  And they're trying to get our dicks hard. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5978.16s)]
*  They're trying to get our dicks hard. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5979.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're doing a good job. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5981.44s)]
*  They are doing a good job. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5982.48s)]
*  So I do have some empathy for not the Lauren Chen one and her husband, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5987.28s)]
*  who are clearly a Russian. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5991.84s)]
*  But Tim Pool and all these other guys. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5992.96s)]
*  I do have some empathy. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5994.32s)]
*  And they apparently gave them a story. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5995.28s)]
*  They said that the funding came from a fictitious persona of a wealthy European sponsor, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=5997.12s)]
*  Edward Gregorian. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6003.44s)]
*  Gregorian, yeah. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6004.24s)]
*  I would take the money. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6005.12s)]
*  I'd be like, yeah, it's good enough for me. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6006.48s)]
*  This is a wealthy guy that wants content for his thing. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6008.96s)]
*  He wants Trump to win or whatever. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6011.04s)]
*  He's like a right wing dude and he's going to make money on it. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6013.04s)]
*  You can be like, all right, maybe. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6015.68s)]
*  The point that I think that we should be making here is that all of the independent journalists [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6018.0s)]
*  and independent media that has been shaming mainstream media for being biased, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6023.68s)]
*  for being bought by the corporations, I think it's very hard for them to continue doing that, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6029.76s)]
*  knowing that they don't spend that much time vetting the people sponsoring their videos. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6036.08s)]
*  Because if you really care about being unbiased, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6041.6s)]
*  even if you are in your videos, the fact that the people know that you've been bought by [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6047.76s)]
*  special interest groups, it can discredit what you're saying. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6052.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6056.72s)]
*  In the same way that we discredit CNN or Fox News for maybe not being as critical as they could be [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6057.12s)]
*  about the pharmaceutical industry is because they are responsible for 50% of their ads. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6064.48s)]
*  Now, CNN and Fox might be like, we do stories all the time about how fucked up the pharmaceutical [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6069.04s)]
*  industry and the Sackler family pushing fentanyl, whatever it is. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6073.599999999999s)]
*  But the perception is still, you're bought. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6077.759999999999s)]
*  It's also worth noting that the report basically says that they had influence on their content. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6080.639999999999s)]
*  It wasn't for some of them. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6088.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I heard. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6089.839999999999s)]
*  I read that the DOJ said that all of them outside of the Lauren Chen and her husband, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6091.04s)]
*  all the other creators are not being accused of [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6096.08s)]
*  ties or espionage or having their videos be manipulated. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6101.2s)]
*  That's what I read in the DOJ report. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6104.56s)]
*  This says the two defendants requested that tenant influencers produce content blaming [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6106.400000000001s)]
*  the Krakow City Hall attack on Ukraine and the US. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6110.64s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they were forced to make that content. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6115.84s)]
*  It just means that that content aligned with what they wanted. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6118.4s)]
*  I think they're saying they asked them to make it, but it doesn't say who. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6120.879999999999s)]
*  It could have been one person. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6124.0s)]
*  They asked them to make that content and the rest of them didn't know. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6126.799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't say which one and it always just says commentator one and two and just says [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6130.32s)]
*  their subscriber amount. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6133.679999999999s)]
*  So it doesn't actually say who did what. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6134.5599999999995s)]
*  According to this, it just says that the two defendants requested that tenant [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6137.92s)]
*  influencers produce content blaming this attack on Ukraine. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6142.48s)]
*  So if they're requesting it, again, I don't know if they agreed to it. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6145.28s)]
*  Maybe they said no. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6147.92s)]
*  They could have asked. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6148.72s)]
*  They could have just asked Lauren Chen and her husband and then they decided who they [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6149.28s)]
*  wanted to make that content. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6151.92s)]
*  They told those guys to make that content. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6153.04s)]
*  They made that content. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6154.64s)]
*  And maybe they said no. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6155.36s)]
*  They said, we don't want to. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6156.16s)]
*  I don't know necessarily, but if there is an outside influence and like foreign dollars [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6157.44s)]
*  changing the type of content that you make, to me, that is more egregious. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6162.32s)]
*  I think the important thing is we are all willing to sell out, myself included. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6166.72s)]
*  Russia, what's up? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6171.36s)]
*  Russia, what's up? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6172.4s)]
*  We need a big. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6175.36s)]
*  All this time I'm not getting a bag for saying I'm team China over here, man. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6175.92s)]
*  I'm missing out for years. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6179.12s)]
*  What you think about the Tucker interview with the Martyr Made guy? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6182.4s)]
*  I didn't watch the whole thing, but I saw the clips. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6188.96s)]
*  You guys didn't watch it? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6190.639999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6191.5199999999995s)]
*  I just saw some clips. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6191.68s)]
*  It's not even close to as bad if you watch the whole thing as the way it's being perceived on. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6192.88s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6197.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6197.84s)]
*  The way that I saw it on Twitter was this guy said the Holocaust wasn't that bad. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6198.16s)]
*  It was poor planning. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6202.48s)]
*  The concentration camps were poor planning. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6203.68s)]
*  I think it was actually the planning was really well done. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6205.76s)]
*  It was like a masterful planning. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6208.8s)]
*  And then Winston Churchill was a coward and like the true enemy of the war. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6210.64s)]
*  Those are like the sound bites that I heard and saw. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6213.76s)]
*  The true villain. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6216.08s)]
*  Okay, so here's what I'll say. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6217.2s)]
*  I listened to the whole thing. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6218.4s)]
*  A couple things going on here. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6221.76s)]
*  If you're a historian, you dedicate your life to... [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6225.92s)]
*  Okay, he says a couple things. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6229.6s)]
*  He says he likes creating content around cultural mythology. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6231.28s)]
*  And what happens is every culture has their mythology. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6239.28s)]
*  There's religious mythology, but there's also cultural mythology, meaning like, [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6242.4s)]
*  this is the course of history in America. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6246.32s)]
*  This is how we see it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6248.8s)]
*  And this is exactly what happened. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6250.88s)]
*  And we do not chip away at that. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6252.48s)]
*  We do not offer alternative takes. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6255.2s)]
*  This is just what we all accept happened. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6257.759999999999s)]
*  And the way he framed it is like, and oftentimes like, that isn't exactly what happened. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6260.96s)]
*  It is just the framework of what we want to believe happened. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6267.36s)]
*  And there is wiggle room for truth. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6270.72s)]
*  Now, the way that he describes the Jews, what happened in the Holocaust, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6273.6s)]
*  in this brief moment, and Churchill. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6279.52s)]
*  I'll start with the Churchill thing. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6282.24s)]
*  This is pretty interesting. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6283.28s)]
*  He goes, I once said to a friend, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6284.96s)]
*  and I may have been being hyperbolic and purposely antagonistic, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6287.92s)]
*  but I said to him, the real chief villain of World War II was Winston Churchill. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6293.28s)]
*  But he caveats it going, I'm trying to antagonize him. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6298.64s)]
*  And what he strikes me as is a guy who gets his intellectual rocks off [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6302.72s)]
*  by exposing things to people that they feel they truly understand. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6310.16s)]
*  And showing them that there is another take that they don't understand at all. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6317.84s)]
*  Now, the problem with this is, nobody does as much research as him, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6322.0s)]
*  except the other experts. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6326.64s)]
*  The rest of us don't. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6328.32s)]
*  We watch a few World War II movies. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6329.28s)]
*  We learned about it in school, and we're like, that's what happened. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6331.36s)]
*  And then he comes over and he goes, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6334.5599999999995s)]
*  the original idea of the Germans and Hitler was not to have, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6337.599999999999s)]
*  would not to just kill all the Jews, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6343.04s)]
*  that this was a, how do you phrase it? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6345.2s)]
*  They used specific language. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6348.8s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6350.4s)]
*  It was a planning error. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6351.84s)]
*  And basically what happened is, they had all these people, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6353.599999999999s)]
*  and they didn't have enough food to feed them. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6356.0s)]
*  And they said, there's even letters from the guards, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6357.5199999999995s)]
*  like would the humane thing to be to do is kill them, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6359.44s)]
*  instead of having them all starve slowly throughout the winter. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6362.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6366.96s)]
*  Now, here's the interesting thing about this, right? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6367.679999999999s)]
*  None of us have read anything about World War II. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6371.5199999999995s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6375.2s)]
*  None of us can refute that. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6377.2s)]
*  None of us have read the letter he's referencing. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6379.04s)]
*  None of us have read the books that he's referencing. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6381.76s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6384.96s)]
*  Do we want to read the books? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6386.8s)]
*  No. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6388.72s)]
*  Are we going to read the letter? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6389.2s)]
*  No. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6390.4s)]
*  You know what's way easier? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6390.72s)]
*  This guy's a fucking anti-Semite. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6392.32s)]
*  That motherfucker hates Jews because I don't want to read. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6393.84s)]
*  That is way easier. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6397.44s)]
*  And that's what we do with most things. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6398.48s)]
*  When we have to do a lot of intellectual heavy lifting, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6399.92s)]
*  we just go, I don't want to deal with this fucking shit. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6402.08s)]
*  We do it all the time with black people. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6404.48s)]
*  Somebody offers certain statistics about black crime and these things. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6406.16s)]
*  And then someone goes, shut up, you racist. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6409.839999999999s)]
*  And it's like, whoa. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6413.12s)]
*  I do think with what he's saying here, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6414.48s)]
*  there's just a couple questions that you would ask follow-ups. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6416.719999999999s)]
*  Like, why were they in the camps? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6418.879999999999s)]
*  You can't, why did they not get the, what's going on? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6421.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6423.12s)]
*  It's like even having this conversation, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6423.679999999999s)]
*  I think what we have to acknowledge here is [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6426.24s)]
*  that most historians that have reacted to this [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6428.48s)]
*  have said that he's incredibly wrong. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6430.879999999999s)]
*  That he is, in my estimation, he's just trying to have a hot take about history. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6432.64s)]
*  If you dedicate your life to history, you can't just write a new book [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6439.200000000001s)]
*  that's the same book that everybody's written. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6442.240000000001s)]
*  You're not going to sell any copies. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6444.4800000000005s)]
*  So he's trying to be like almost a comedian about it where it's like, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6446.08s)]
*  okay, here's another angle you didn't know about. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6448.96s)]
*  I think a lot of times historians do this when they want attention. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6451.52s)]
*  Here's the reality. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6454.88s)]
*  There is maybe some truths in this thing, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6455.76s)]
*  but it's not as sexy when there's just little bits of truth. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6459.4400000000005s)]
*  It's sexier and gets the entire internet talking [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6463.04s)]
*  when you come from a completely different angle. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6465.84s)]
*  So just to caveat that, you said something real quick. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6469.84s)]
*  And this wouldn't be easy to just ask follow-up questions [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6473.2s)]
*  like why were they in the camps in the first place? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6475.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6476.96s)]
*  His argument would be like, okay, what we're doing is [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6477.84s)]
*  we're purifying the German identity. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6480.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't consider Jews German. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6484.5599999999995s)]
*  We also don't consider the Catholics Germans [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6487.68s)]
*  or the Blacks Germans or the fucking gypsies or whatever. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6489.599999999999s)]
*  I think they were also in the camps as well. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6492.0s)]
*  So the Jews just happened to be the largest minority in Germany at the time. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6495.6s)]
*  It's not like there were tons of fucking Muslims and shit there. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6499.2s)]
*  Jews are large. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6502.24s)]
*  So they're the largest quantity of people that are in the camps. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6502.96s)]
*  There's also this idea that they've been being blamed. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6505.52s)]
*  And Kittler used this hatred of Jews and their control in the banks. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6508.4s)]
*  And they're the ones that are suffocating the German economy. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6512.0s)]
*  He uses fear-mongering to build this kind of support, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6514.56s)]
*  which he's not acknowledging close to enough in this argument. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6517.84s)]
*  He's not. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6521.6s)]
*  The Mein Kampf thing that you brought up last time. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6522.32s)]
*  It's like, isn't that the whole point of the book? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6524.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6525.76s)]
*  I haven't read Mein Kampf. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6526.32s)]
*  So I can't say whether he said, yo, we're going to gather them all up and kill them. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6527.12s)]
*  But even after Mein Kampf, as he's coming up in power, like Andrew's saying, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6530.0s)]
*  Jews are mentioned in every single topic. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6534.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6536.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6537.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6537.76s)]
*  So again, even this is so delicate to talk about [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6538.8s)]
*  because in my head as we're talking about this, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6541.6s)]
*  I'm like, oh, they're going to take some excerpt out and say, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6543.12s)]
*  oh, they're apologizing for the hog. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6545.36s)]
*  That's why these conversations are impossible. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6547.36s)]
*  Keep it while we do it. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6550.160000000001s)]
*  Again, this is the way to have a hot take on history. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6555.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6558.160000000001s)]
*  See it all the time. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6558.64s)]
*  I wonder if historians will also do this where in the conversation, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6559.52s)]
*  there is a basic assumption of facts that they don't always reiterate them. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6562.4800000000005s)]
*  Like when comics hang, the jokes will be dark and fucked up [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6566.080000000001s)]
*  because there is a basic assumption, yeah, we're comics. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6569.52s)]
*  I'm making fun of your dead dog because that's what we do. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6571.76s)]
*  And we're friends like that. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6575.84s)]
*  So I wonder if historians do that where they're like, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6577.4400000000005s)]
*  oh, well, did you know this about World War II? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6579.28s)]
*  And the assumption is like, yeah, Hitler is bad. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6581.12s)]
*  But they don't always reiterate it because they're sort of desensitized to the topic at hand. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6583.679999999999s)]
*  So I thought that. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6587.84s)]
*  And then he was on Twitter defending his position. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6589.679999999999s)]
*  I read this whole thread. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6592.639999999999s)]
*  It's basically the word he's apologizing for Hitler. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6596.639999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's apologizing. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6600.24s)]
*  He's like, this person is horrible. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6601.2s)]
*  What he did to humanity is disgusting. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6603.04s)]
*  He's awful. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6604.719999999999s)]
*  It's vile. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6605.28s)]
*  That's not what he's saying. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6606.32s)]
*  It's incredibly viable. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6607.84s)]
*  But what he's saying is that in his position, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6609.84s)]
*  he didn't think that Hitler wanted to extend the war [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6613.44s)]
*  and that it was actually Churchill. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6616.5599999999995s)]
*  And then there's like a veiled suggestion that Churchill had some debts that were paid off by, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6619.679999999999s)]
*  he doesn't say it, but the Jews. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6628.4s)]
*  And he's kind of in the pockets of the Zionists. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6631.76s)]
*  And they wanted this war expanded. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6635.28s)]
*  And that's why he continued the war when what he alleges is that Hitler was trying to sue for peace. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6638.0s)]
*  In other words, he was like, I don't want to go into Britain. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6644.16s)]
*  I got everything that we need. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6646.4s)]
*  We're good to go. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6647.68s)]
*  Does he substantiate this? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6648.64s)]
*  Or is this just like? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6649.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6650.56s)]
*  He's like, they dropped pamphlets and did all this other shit. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6650.8s)]
*  And he's saying like even what he was saying is like, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6653.84s)]
*  Churchill was just all they had, I guess, at the time were these fire bombs that you could drop. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6657.76s)]
*  And he was just fire bombing the Black Forest. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6663.52s)]
*  Anything to continue the conflict. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6665.52s)]
*  He wanted to continue the conflict. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6667.5199999999995s)]
*  This is. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6670.16s)]
*  Though he didn't read it. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6670.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6671.759999999999s)]
*  This is what he's saying. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6673.5199999999995s)]
*  This is what he's saying. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6674.5599999999995s)]
*  Now, of course, this is incredibly engaging because you're like, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6676.24s)]
*  well, I haven't heard this side of history at all. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6678.799999999999s)]
*  I just heard the side where Churchill is this like brilliant, powerful, brave leader [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6680.32s)]
*  that saved the world from speaking German. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6685.679999999999s)]
*  It also feels like it's politically and culturally convenient. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6688.32s)]
*  Well, I'm sure that's why Tucker's happened a lot. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6692.879999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6695.44s)]
*  But it is like there's like so much like anti-Israeli vitriol on Twitter. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6696.56s)]
*  And it's like also World War II, the Jews did it. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6700.56s)]
*  You're like, yeah. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6703.04s)]
*  Oh, what? [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6703.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6704.4800000000005s)]
*  Also, by the way, just a technical thing on the bombing runs. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6704.88s)]
*  This is proven. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6707.68s)]
*  The Brits would do the bombing runs at night because they were getting picked up out of [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6708.64s)]
*  the sky every two seconds. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6713.28s)]
*  The Americans who actually had some consideration were doing the bombing runs in the daytime. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6714.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm talking about the Black Forest drops. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6719.28s)]
*  We're talking about different times. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6720.64s)]
*  We're talking about before the Americans have even engaged in the war and before [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6721.52s)]
*  Britain is even officially at war with Germany. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6724.959999999999s)]
*  So like I think Germany invades Poland, then they take France. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6729.28s)]
*  And then apparently Hitler's gone, yeah, I don't have any intention to go into Great Britain. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6732.799999999999s)]
*  Like the real war is going to be East with called the Phony War, I believe. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6736.959999999999s)]
*  I don't know the term for it. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6740.48s)]
*  But yeah, again, so you're listening to this and you're like, wow, I haven't heard this [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6741.679999999999s)]
*  take on this historical event. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6746.4s)]
*  Even if you disagree, you're going to read the whole threat. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6747.919999999999s)]
*  You're going to go. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6749.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's fascinating. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6750.639999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not even saying this to pick on you. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6752.08s)]
*  Dove would read the whole threat because he'd be so riled up. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6753.6s)]
*  But I just I understand what he's. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6755.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's how we're paying attention. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6758.240000000001s)]
*  We're talking about right now. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6760.240000000001s)]
*  These historians, man, just stick to ancient civilizations and aliens with a cloud. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6761.92s)]
*  So you know, Jews actually started aliens. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6766.0s)]
*  You know that, right? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6768.64s)]
*  Really? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6769.6s)]
*  You didn't know about this? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6770.0s)]
*  You didn't know about that? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6770.8s)]
*  I believe this. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6771.52s)]
*  So what's actually interesting, like it's interesting you say that when there's enough time, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6772.08s)]
*  you can speak about the historical moment, right? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6779.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6784.88s)]
*  And nobody really cares. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6785.52s)]
*  Like if somebody's talking about like what, you know, Alexander the Great really did or [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6786.8s)]
*  what he really conquered and someone has an alternative take, it's not like the Macedonian [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6791.92s)]
*  community is coming out. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6798.08s)]
*  Well, actually, technically, his body didn't go to Egypt and it went over here and we have [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6799.12s)]
*  maybe a few people, but it's so distant. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6803.68s)]
*  It is funny. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6806.16s)]
*  Sometimes you will see people like that. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6806.96s)]
*  Sometimes you will see people doing this and you're like, what's going on? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6808.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6811.12s)]
*  I was talking about Mahenjo-daro. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6811.599999999999s)]
*  Mahenjo-daro, like this ancient civilization that got destroyed and there's bodies everywhere. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6813.919999999999s)]
*  But no, I brought it up and I was like, yeah, it's located in modern-day Pakistan. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6822.24s)]
*  And then there's all these comments of people being like, it wasn't Pakistan back then. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6825.759999999999s)]
*  That was India. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6829.28s)]
*  We built that. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6830.24s)]
*  And I'm like, come on. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6831.28s)]
*  So perfect example, it's like only a small faction of people are going to be like really [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6832.799999999999s)]
*  riled up about it. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6837.36s)]
*  And it also doesn't matter. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6838.24s)]
*  And it doesn't matter. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6839.2s)]
*  But this is so close. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6840.16s)]
*  And it is, like he said, part of our accepted mythology. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6842.08s)]
*  The Western mythology that is accepted is this. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6845.679999999999s)]
*  And when you chip away at that, there are going to be people that are incredibly angry. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6849.92s)]
*  One, because they're like, have I been lied to my whole life? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6853.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd rather not be lied to my whole life. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6855.84s)]
*  I'd rather this guy be a liar. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6857.599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6859.44s)]
*  Because I don't want to do all this research and learn all this different reality. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6859.76s)]
*  Like, of course not. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6863.04s)]
*  Rock the whole foundation. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6863.5199999999995s)]
*  But it seems disingenuous to take out specific soundbites to make him look terrible. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6864.4s)]
*  Now, he doubles down on other things that I think are very, would cause a lot of engagement, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6867.68s)]
*  but also might be seen as racist. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6874.320000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're racist per se, but it's this perception that like he has empathy for [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6880.400000000001s)]
*  like the white people in England that like died. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6887.280000000001s)]
*  Their ancestors died in World War II. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6891.76s)]
*  They fought this war to maintain the idea of what an English person is. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6893.6s)]
*  The whole argument is we can't let Germany take us over. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6897.5199999999995s)]
*  We'll lose our identity as England. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6900.24s)]
*  We should die and all these people should die so that our children can grow up with [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6902.639999999999s)]
*  an English identity, something that we've preserved for a thousand years. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6908.799999999999s)]
*  So they seem racist at all. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6912.96s)]
*  Now, he's like, now you have all these immigrants coming in and completely changing what it is [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6914.639999999999s)]
*  to be an English person and an English identity and what is England. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6919.12s)]
*  And then he's like, well, what the fuck did we do all that fighting for? [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6922.719999999999s)]
*  What was the purpose of that? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6925.44s)]
*  And he thinks that a country has the right. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6926.56s)]
*  His argument is that this is American influence over the West, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6930.96s)]
*  where Americans identity is built around accepting immigrants and give us your week, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6936.320000000001s)]
*  give us your hungry. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6941.200000000001s)]
*  And we've never had this moment where being an American is this one thing. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6942.0s)]
*  It's always been about accepting. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6945.4400000000005s)]
*  And we're kind of imposing that on these countries that have existed for thousands of years. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6950.080000000001s)]
*  And now people are eating dogs in fucking in palace. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6955.12s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6958.0s)]
*  They're coming over here. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6958.96s)]
*  So yeah, I remember with fish and chips. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6960.32s)]
*  Seeing that stuff and I was like, okay, this is what the guy's doing. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6963.44s)]
*  This is two guys. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6966.16s)]
*  He's catering to a fan base. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6967.12s)]
*  He's going to get his money. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6968.639999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, buddy. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6970.08s)]
*  And I don't. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6970.88s)]
*  But at the same time, like I don't know if that's like a horrible argument. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6971.599999999999s)]
*  I think you have to spend some time in Europe to understand it. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6974.88s)]
*  Because if you try to understand through an American lens, it makes no sense at all. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6977.44s)]
*  Like what makes New York amazing is the diversity. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6980.88s)]
*  What makes New York amazing are all these different cultures. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6983.36s)]
*  We're all living together. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6986.08s)]
*  We're sharing culture. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6987.599999999999s)]
*  And we've curated the most amazing city in the world. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6989.5199999999995s)]
*  It's truly amazing. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6991.5199999999995s)]
*  He's a comedian with some really interesting premises. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6992.48s)]
*  But you shouldn't take him seriously when you go home. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6995.2s)]
*  But I don't know if you believe that. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=6997.36s)]
*  Because if all of a sudden, again, white people started moving to India [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7001.759999999999s)]
*  and changing what Indian culture is. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7007.2s)]
*  Like you've already complained about Indian culture becoming too westernized. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7009.28s)]
*  And Japanese people started coming and then making it a little more Japanese. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7013.28s)]
*  Like I'm going to cut you off because India got imperialized, got conquered. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7016.719999999999s)]
*  India was supposed to have an entirely different trajectory. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7020.799999999999s)]
*  It got Rob Pillage rape fucked. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7023.599999999999s)]
*  Now I have a sensitivity to it. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7026.0s)]
*  England didn't get imperialized Rob Pillage rape fucked by any of these foreigners for sure coming in. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7027.839999999999s)]
*  No Indian country. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7033.28s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7034.5599999999995s)]
*  But you're bringing in Indians when you have the British Empire for sure. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7035.12s)]
*  But I mean, like, of course, the Roman Empire conquered them. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7038.32s)]
*  Yeah, not by, but not exactly, not by the people that you don't like. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7042.64s)]
*  He doesn't have a problem with Romans, Italians coming over. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7046.400000000001s)]
*  No, he does. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7049.2s)]
*  He's a problem with Italians. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7050.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7050.96s)]
*  So you think those guys that are rioting. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7051.360000000001s)]
*  He's saying each country, like if Italians came and made England Italian, he is an issue with it. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7053.4400000000005s)]
*  He doesn't like the no border policy. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7059.76s)]
*  He doesn't. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7062.72s)]
*  So he's like every country that fought for their identity should be able to uphold that identity. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7063.6s)]
*  The people he's defending, they don't have a problem with Italians. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7068.96s)]
*  The people he's saying, I understand where they're coming from and sympathizing with. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7072.08s)]
*  But I'm not going to argue on them. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7074.88s)]
*  But that's who he's supporting. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7077.36s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7078.8s)]
*  What I'm just saying, I hear what you're saying. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7079.76s)]
*  But his argument about a nation being able to fight for its identity, and if it doesn't, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7081.36s)]
*  by not accepting large amounts of immigrants, they are looked at as racist. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7088.16s)]
*  I don't know if they should be looked at as racist. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7093.6s)]
*  I think if the idea of fighting that war was to preserve the English identity [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7095.44s)]
*  and accepting large groups of people from other countries is naturally going to chip away at that [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7102.96s)]
*  singular identity. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7108.96s)]
*  I understand the logic behind it. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7111.12s)]
*  That could be one of the many emotions, but I do think there's some racism involved in the same [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7113.28s)]
*  way that like they're not going to be upset at the Italian restaurant opening up in their [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7117.36s)]
*  neighborhood. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7121.04s)]
*  You've made that argument. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7121.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7122.48s)]
*  I'm making it. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7124.0s)]
*  And this is just to what I'm saying earlier. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7125.2s)]
*  That's a great premise. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7126.56s)]
*  I can't find a ton of holes in it. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7127.68s)]
*  A comedian has a great premise. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7129.280000000001s)]
*  You can't just find the holes in it. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7130.56s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7131.92s)]
*  But we both know at the end of the day, this is not like a real thing this person believes, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7132.64s)]
*  or you should know. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7135.6s)]
*  See, I don't like getting into those arguments where it's like we're going to assume what they [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7136.320000000001s)]
*  really mean. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7141.280000000001s)]
*  Like I'm just trying to have the argument based on the words that are said, which is does [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7142.0s)]
*  a country like does Hawaii have the ability to maintain their Hawaiian culture? [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7147.04s)]
*  And when Western culture starts to come in, or even Japanese culture, where these other [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7153.12s)]
*  cultures start to chip away at the Hawaiian identity, do they have the right to be frustrated [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7158.5599999999995s)]
*  with that? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7162.48s)]
*  Or are they racist when they're frustrated? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7162.8s)]
*  But again, you're talking about a colonized place that was in like that's where the difference [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7165.76s)]
*  is. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7170.0s)]
*  Okay, remove colonization. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7170.48s)]
*  Like just do a thought experiment. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7172.0s)]
*  Just do a thought experiment. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7174.24s)]
*  Yeah, as a thought experiment, if they've never been colonized, don't worry about it. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7175.12s)]
*  Everybody's been colonized. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7178.16s)]
*  So that cancels out everybody. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7179.12s)]
*  I mean, they're still colonized. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7180.64s)]
*  Right now. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7182.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7185.52s)]
*  This is why these things are so difficult. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7188.08s)]
*  It's really hard to just even hypothetically discuss it. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7189.68s)]
*  Like if Mexico got mad at a bunch of Americans moving in, I would honestly be like, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7193.36s)]
*  this country changes. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7199.36s)]
*  Like Mexico has been its own country for a long time. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7200.88s)]
*  Country changes. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7204.72s)]
*  It's not Indians moving into England where it's like, well, we have to come here because [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7206.4s)]
*  you actively took all of our jewels. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7211.76s)]
*  They're still in your fucking palace. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7213.76s)]
*  So I have more opportunity here. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7215.6s)]
*  I'm coming. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7217.52s)]
*  You think those jewels are doing anything? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7217.84s)]
*  India was a wealthy. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7220.64s)]
*  Jewels are going to help two billion. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7221.4400000000005s)]
*  I hate this revisionist history where India was wealthy and now all of a sudden they're [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7222.72s)]
*  broke. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7227.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7228.24s)]
*  How is that now all of a sudden? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7229.280000000001s)]
*  Like what are you even talking about? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7230.64s)]
*  I mean, look at Africa. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7231.6s)]
*  Like they took all their resources and Africa's still a poor continent. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7233.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, like I just know that you don't have anything to substantiate that. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7237.68s)]
*  So it's like there's no way to... [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7244.32s)]
*  We're living in like a world where like there's no way to prove the trajectory would have [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7248.32s)]
*  gone completely positive. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7252.08s)]
*  There could have been in-fighting and war. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7253.36s)]
*  I don't think it would have been completely positive. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7255.36s)]
*  But it would have been, I said it was just completely different trajectory. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7256.5599999999995s)]
*  I didn't say it was worse. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7258.8s)]
*  Completely different trajectory that they did not have control of. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7260.48s)]
*  In that situation with Mexico, like I would totally understand if Mexico is like, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7263.28s)]
*  hey, I don't want you chipping away at our culture. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7268.4s)]
*  Like... [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7270.96s)]
*  I think that is happening a little bit. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7271.36s)]
*  I think some Mexicans are mad that like El Salvadorians like come up and like they take [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7272.4s)]
*  over like longclaves or something. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7276.16s)]
*  I was talking about Mexican bodies. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7277.76s)]
*  Like yeah, like there's like they have like immigrants that are moving through and they [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7278.88s)]
*  get annoyed by it. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7282.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's all of Mexico. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7283.04s)]
*  I doubt it. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7284.08s)]
*  And again, we're different in especially like New York because this is part of our identity. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7285.36s)]
*  We've had these different groups of people that we fully embrace coming in here and becoming [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7290.72s)]
*  part of the fabric of what it is to be an American from the beginning. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7294.56s)]
*  Even when we went west, there's Mexicans, there's Native Americans, there's always [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7298.16s)]
*  all these different people. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7302.0s)]
*  Even when we're uniting the country, we were colonies of different countries. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7303.52s)]
*  So there are different cultures for us to even handle. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7308.08s)]
*  You go down to New Orleans and there's like French speakers. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7310.56s)]
*  Like there's just all this different stuff that we've had to deal with. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7313.12s)]
*  So this is our idea of what a country is. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7316.16s)]
*  Some of these scoop the bagel ass people. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7318.72s)]
*  Like they... [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7320.5599999999995s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7320.96s)]
*  I'm a scoop the bagel. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7321.76s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7323.2s)]
*  That's racist. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7324.64s)]
*  Get those people out of there. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7326.72s)]
*  So I do think we're projecting our idea of like acceptance on other countries that are [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7328.5599999999995s)]
*  just like, hey, listen, we've worked thousands of years to curate this identity and we don't [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7333.36s)]
*  want to water that identity down. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7338.4s)]
*  And the people that do come in here and if they end up watering it down, it's not going [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7341.04s)]
*  to be something we like and don't call us racist for that. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7345.2s)]
*  I... [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7348.32s)]
*  You tell me if I'm wrong. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7349.6s)]
*  Let's say a bunch of Chinese people start to move into Italy and they start to like [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7353.84s)]
*  change what it is to be an Italian. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7358.24s)]
*  Are they raw? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7360.24s)]
*  Are they racist for that? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7360.8s)]
*  No, probably nationalist. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7363.76s)]
*  But is that wrong? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7365.68s)]
*  I mean, I guess it depends to what degree. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7368.0s)]
*  Oh, based on our perspective of a country, that's wrong. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7370.16s)]
*  But we also don't have thousands of years of history and like identity built into that. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7372.64s)]
*  Like, I would feel wrong. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7378.72s)]
*  I know India is a different example, but like I feel like let's say we white people, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7382.88s)]
*  just Europeans, start moving into China and slowly changing China and making China more white. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7388.48s)]
*  Like I would... [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7393.12s)]
*  And they were like, hey, we don't like how China is becoming so like westernized. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7393.76s)]
*  Like we're losing our cultural identity. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7396.8s)]
*  I wouldn't be like, you fucking racist. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7398.24s)]
*  How dare you? [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7400.4s)]
*  Like I'd be like, yeah, I get that. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7401.5199999999995s)]
*  Like we're coming to your shit and then making your shit ours. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7402.72s)]
*  It's... [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7405.44s)]
*  We talk about this with gentrification all the time. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7405.76s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking about. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7407.84s)]
*  Like when it comes to gentrification, we unanimously agree it's wrong. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7408.72s)]
*  And then when it comes to the gentrification of a country... [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7413.4400000000005s)]
*  We don't like it, but we don't stop it. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7417.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7419.84s)]
*  But it's oftentimes the people that they don't have the power to stop it. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7420.64s)]
*  And if they maybe did have the power, they would do something. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7425.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's like a power and affluence thing. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7430.08s)]
*  Like I think powerful countries that don't accept immigrants in large degrees [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7432.24s)]
*  are then seen as like xenophobic. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7435.280000000001s)]
*  Whereas poor countries that don't accept them are seen as protectionist. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7437.2s)]
*  They seem like they're conserving their resources and like not just letting anyone... [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7441.12s)]
*  And maybe that's why Italy wouldn't bother me as much. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7444.72s)]
*  Also, maybe just Italian culture is cooler to me or whatever. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7446.72s)]
*  So the Italy thing, I'm like, I get it more for Italy than England. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7449.44s)]
*  England, I... [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7452.96s)]
*  I also think if you are... [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7454.24s)]
*  If you have a problem with the people coming in, that's a little different than saying, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7455.599999999999s)]
*  hey, if you're going to come here, just assimilate. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7459.36s)]
*  If you're going to come here, do our shit. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7461.12s)]
*  I wouldn't love that, but I get it. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7462.5599999999995s)]
*  If you're going to move to my country, embrace our culture, this is what it is. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7464.5599999999995s)]
*  If they're telling the people, come here and embrace what it is to be English. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7468.0s)]
*  Muslims, stop doing that to women. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7471.28s)]
*  That's fine. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7475.36s)]
*  But when you have a problem with them coming in, it starts to feel different. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7475.919999999999s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7478.32s)]
*  You're damned if you do, damned if you don't. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7479.5199999999995s)]
*  If you say, hey, if you come here, you got to take on our traditions and customs. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7483.2s)]
*  France basically says, hey, you can't wear the hijab, you can't do that. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7488.24s)]
*  Then all of a sudden you're like, well, you're not really a free country. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7491.679999999999s)]
*  These people can't even live free. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7493.92s)]
*  They're criticized all the time for the lack of freedom that they're giving Muslim women. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7497.12s)]
*  I think they said they couldn't wear hijabs during the Olympics. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7501.12s)]
*  So they're restricting their freedom. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7504.24s)]
*  They're basically saying you're free to be French, but then don't be not French about it. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7505.4400000000005s)]
*  But then also they don't want to restrict their own citizens. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7510.64s)]
*  So if you're a citizen of France, you have the freedom to reject French shit, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7513.4400000000005s)]
*  but not if you're coming from the outside. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7518.0s)]
*  I think this notion of a free country is very American. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7521.52s)]
*  I don't know if that's a part of the cultural identity of Western Europe. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7525.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, that's fair. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7528.0s)]
*  That's fair. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7528.72s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is, well, maybe France, liberté, galité. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7529.280000000001s)]
*  Freedom is part of the... [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7533.200000000001s)]
*  Liberté, galité, what's the other term? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7535.4400000000005s)]
*  Fraternité. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7538.240000000001s)]
*  Freedom is in the slogan for the country. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7540.0s)]
*  I just don't know if it's built into the cultural ethos the way it is in America. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7544.080000000001s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7546.8s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is this is a very difficult conversation, not difficult maybe, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7547.6s)]
*  but prickly conversation, where every side has decent justification. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7555.360000000001s)]
*  And I think all too often, because we don't want to have a conversation, we're like, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7562.160000000001s)]
*  ah, you're a racist. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7566.72s)]
*  Shut up, you're a racist. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7568.64s)]
*  I don't know if that is. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7569.92s)]
*  And I don't think I would call a country racist if I was the one coming into their [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7571.200000000001s)]
*  country and trying to change it to make it easier for me. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7577.12s)]
*  And they were rejecting that. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7580.48s)]
*  I wouldn't call them racist. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7582.08s)]
*  I would be like, that's inconvenient to me because I want my shit. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7584.0s)]
*  But you're not racist for that. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7587.76s)]
*  I am coming to your country trying to change it to make it good for me. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7589.36s)]
*  I feel like that's a little much. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7595.28s)]
*  I'm going to your shit trying to make it more comfortable for me. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7598.72s)]
*  And when it's not, you're racist? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7602.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is a power thing, though. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7604.16s)]
*  If you're coming from America, it's like, oh, yeah, you're already coming from a superpower. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7605.68s)]
*  If you're coming from a much worse off country that's still developing, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7610.4800000000005s)]
*  then I think people would be like, oh, why can't you help the needy? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7614.64s)]
*  I think these concepts of like- [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7618.240000000001s)]
*  That's an American? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7619.92s)]
*  And that was the argument he was making. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7622.56s)]
*  This is an American identity that we are putting on European countries that have fought [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7623.84s)]
*  for thousands of years to not have. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7632.08s)]
*  There's a reason they got borders out there in Europe because millions of people have lost [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7636.24s)]
*  their lives over thousands of years to patch out those borders so they can keep their languages [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7640.96s)]
*  and their cultures. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7645.04s)]
*  They're like, I don't want to be French. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7646.4s)]
*  I'm from Switzerland, but we almost speak the same language. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7647.76s)]
*  I don't fuck with you. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7650.64s)]
*  It's definitely a new idea. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7652.5599999999995s)]
*  No question. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7654.08s)]
*  I think like a thousand years ago, if you lived in Rome, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7654.5599999999995s)]
*  two thousand years ago, if you lived in Rome, your ethnicity didn't really matter. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7657.92s)]
*  So long as you assimilated to being Roman. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7662.08s)]
*  I don't think they had the same even understanding of race and ethnicity in the way that we do now. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7665.04s)]
*  I don't think they saw people as like, oh, you are an African person or you are an Asian person. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7669.36s)]
*  I think they were like, you are Roman or not Roman. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7672.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, is that fair? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7675.12s)]
*  Unless you're Jewish and they put you in the ghetto. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7677.2s)]
*  Even back then? [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7679.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it was fine. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7681.04s)]
*  But I think these are like, I think it's not necessarily built on racialized lines [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7683.44s)]
*  as the way it is now. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7686.64s)]
*  I think the idea of ethnicity was different. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7687.84s)]
*  So I think that that is uniquely American, the idea of ethnicity because of the way [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7689.36s)]
*  America developed through colonization. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7694.799999999999s)]
*  The idea of race and blackness and whiteness kind of comes out of that, to my understanding. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7697.28s)]
*  And so now that race is sort of constructed, I think it has been exported to other countries [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7702.639999999999s)]
*  where it's like now they're grappling with this idea of racism without necessarily the [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7706.48s)]
*  historical heritage of racism as we've had in America. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7710.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7713.5199999999995s)]
*  Whether or not they should or shouldn't, I think is up for debate. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7715.28s)]
*  I don't know if it's necessarily settled. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7718.56s)]
*  But don't you think that part of the ethos of America would to accept you're hungry, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7720.320000000001s)]
*  you're weak? [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7723.84s)]
*  That wasn't part of the ethos of these other countries. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7725.52s)]
*  I think the only time they were accepting immigrants is when it was beneficial to them, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7728.0s)]
*  when they needed cheap labor. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7731.84s)]
*  And I will say, if a country like France needs cheap labor because their people won't work [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7734.160000000001s)]
*  and they ask these people from foreign countries to come in, [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7739.6s)]
*  that is a very different situation than if they're being benevolent and [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7743.6s)]
*  bring people in that need help. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7747.04s)]
*  If you're being benevolent, you're truly just helping people, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7749.92s)]
*  then you want to add the expectation of, hey, fall in line with what this country is, that's fair. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7754.08s)]
*  But if you're bringing them in so you could pay them on slave labor, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7760.72s)]
*  and then you're on top of that going, but also it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't have it [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7765.5199999999995s)]
*  both ways. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7770.24s)]
*  Again, it's just a fucking hard, it's a tricky one. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7772.72s)]
*  It's a tricky conversation that we immediately label people and make radioactive. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7775.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you really zoom out, it's not that immediately. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7780.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably more nuanced. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7786.96s)]
*  I also just know nothing about European immigration policy. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7787.839999999999s)]
*  And also I think the understanding of what is and isn't racist, I do think is culturally tethered. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7790.719999999999s)]
*  We don't necessarily have colorism in the same way as it exists in Brazil and parts of South America, [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7797.2s)]
*  but it's that exists there. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7801.04s)]
*  So what they would consider as racist is probably slightly different than what we would consider it [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7803.36s)]
*  as. And I think it is tied to the violence that your history has gone through. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7807.2s)]
*  And I would also say to Akash's point, it's like, if you have, like England, I have far less empathy [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7810.4s)]
*  for, and like France, I have far less empathy for us. Because if you have colonized these nations, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7816.639999999999s)]
*  and you have, I'm not saying they deserve to be there, but a lot of these, I think the communities [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7820.88s)]
*  of these countries that grew within England [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7830.4800000000005s)]
*  did it when these countries were still part of the empire. What is it called? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7834.8s)]
*  The British Empire? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7841.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's a name for it. I don't forget the name. But like Jamaica, for example, I think was [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7842.8s)]
*  part of the British Empire. Even Canada was still loosely- [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7849.84s)]
*  Commonwealth? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7854.56s)]
*  The Commonwealth, yeah. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7855.4400000000005s)]
*  Australia. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7857.04s)]
*  The Cayman Islands. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7857.68s)]
*  So like these people going back to the homeland, if you will, it's not their homeland, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7859.36s)]
*  but it's the homeland of the center of their government, the center of the decision making. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7864.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think that you can fault them in any way for that, especially when you've [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7869.2s)]
*  controlled those regions and you're extrapolating resources. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7873.52s)]
*  So I think that is- [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7876.56s)]
*  That's where I feel like it's a little bit different. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7877.36s)]
*  But if it's a country that you have no connection to at all- [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7879.6s)]
*  I get it more. Then I get where they're coming from more. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7882.72s)]
*  That was my point about India. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7886.16s)]
*  Sorry for being reductive about your point. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7887.68s)]
*  No, it's fine. But this strikes me every time I go to India. The infrastructure is [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7889.12s)]
*  fucked and all of that. But it was a country that once they got freedom, not only had everything [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7893.04s)]
*  been kind of plundered, they got 400 million people when they start the country. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7897.76s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7901.200000000001s)]
*  America starts with 13 colonies, I want a thousand people, and then it expands and it gets to build [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7901.76s)]
*  up everything as it expands. India starts with no money and 400 million people. They got more [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7906.96s)]
*  people then than we have in America now. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7911.280000000001s)]
*  It's incredibly different. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7913.12s)]
*  One sixth of the landmass. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7914.400000000001s)]
*  Every time that strikes me and it's like, yeah, if I got to go to England, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7916.4800000000005s)]
*  some of this is your fault. Maybe not all of it. Some of this is your fault. I'm bringing my shit [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7920.64s)]
*  over in the same way that you feel about the labor. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7924.400000000001s)]
*  I do think, yeah, I don't know. That's why it's almost like a shame. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7928.72s)]
*  It's not a shame. I like the fact that this information is available on a podcast for [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7936.4800000000005s)]
*  everybody to consume. Maybe the problem is like Tucker is so radioactive in the perception of [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7941.36s)]
*  him that even a conversation like this is going to be viewed through the lens of that radioactivity. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7948.08s)]
*  If this guy maybe, maybe is talking to some fucking NPR, PBS nerd or something like that. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7956.96s)]
*  John Stewart. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7968.0s)]
*  Here's an alternative take on this and I understand that this is going to be inflammatory, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7969.92s)]
*  but let's try to extrapolate this without name calling and give me pushback. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7974.48s)]
*  You need healthy pushback is what I was going to say. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7978.5599999999995s)]
*  Instead of Tucker going, yeah, where's the fucking Nuremberg trials for them? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7980.639999999999s)]
*  Then it starts to look a little bit weird. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7983.5199999999995s)]
*  He's excited about it. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7985.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you think he knew what he was doing in that point, the one that is going back to the killing [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7987.76s)]
*  of people during World War II? Did he specify Jews or civilians in POWs? Because I think what [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7992.5599999999995s)]
*  happens is groups that have been pushing, this is the history of the Holocaust, they're saying, [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=7998.88s)]
*  we have this proven. Then he's bringing up a point about some German officer who was talking [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8005.12s)]
*  maybe about some civilians and POWs in Russia and they didn't understand what to do with them. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8009.12s)]
*  That's the point he's making versus the Germans had a plan for many, many, many years to kill the [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8015.36s)]
*  Jews. That's just fucking proven and Tucker's not there to call him out on that point. Was he [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8020.56s)]
*  choosing to not specify because he knew this could get some action? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8025.76s)]
*  No, no. I think this is the reality. None of us had ever heard another take outside of [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8029.360000000001s)]
*  the Germans had a plan to kill all the Jews. None of us have ever heard it. Then he comes out and [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8036.96s)]
*  he's like, yeah, that wasn't their original plan. He goes, that wasn't their original plan. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8042.0s)]
*  And none of us can cite a book or a speech or anything where Hitler goes, yeah, that's my plan [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8049.599999999999s)]
*  to kill all the Jews. The way he was talking about it, he could have specified. Hold on, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8057.599999999999s)]
*  hold on. Here's the question and this will be the deciding factor. Can you cite a line where that [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8063.04s)]
*  was said? So the argument of what I read after that is that- The answer is no. No, he was quoting [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8068.48s)]
*  one German officer that said this and other people are like- [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8075.44s)]
*  Doug, Doug, you're saluting. That's not what I asked you. And this is why what these guys do [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8078.08s)]
*  is so effective is they can attack the accepted truths that none of us have even bothered to [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8084.719999999999s)]
*  research. Because we've accepted his truth. Because we've accepted his truth. None of us have even, [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8095.28s)]
*  no one even would go, let's see if Hitler actually said that. Well, like, of course he said, [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8100.639999999999s)]
*  he did it. He murdered six million fucking Jews. Like, I don't need proof of it. The proof is right [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8104.88s)]
*  there. My father went to all the concentration camps. He saw it. And so just to substantiate what [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8109.04s)]
*  he's saying, he's not saying this guy is right. He's just saying we can't prove him wrong because [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8113.84s)]
*  we've accepted it as right. So we don't do the research to refute that. We haven't done the [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8118.64s)]
*  research. Watch this. It's like this. If he came up to me, he's like, you know, you were really [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8123.36s)]
*  born September 23rd. I go, what? He goes, yeah, you were born, you know. I go, no, it was more [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8127.84s)]
*  October 30th. He's like, no. That's just what Japan has told you. Yeah, Japan has told you. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8133.6s)]
*  There's a report from the hospital at Mount Sinai that there was an Andrew Schultz born on the 23rd. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8139.04s)]
*  I don't have any information. But you have the birth certificate. What? You have the birth [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8145.280000000001s)]
*  certificate. But I don't have it on me. I'd have to call my mom. I'd have to find. So you see, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8149.120000000001s)]
*  you right now, all of us now have to go and look for when Hitler's like, we have to kill all of [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8154.08s)]
*  them. And this is the plan. And Gurbel's or whatever his name is, say, hey, this is our plan. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8159.120000000001s)]
*  Let's put them all that we have to go find that because it was just an accepted piece of knowledge [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8163.28s)]
*  that and I'm sure there's there's hundreds of times out there where they were like explicitly, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8168.0s)]
*  this is our goal that we're going to do. But because we don't know the page of fucking [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8172.96s)]
*  Mein Kampf or whatever propaganda journal they're putting out because we don't have it. We don't [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8177.92s)]
*  have to react to everything in real time. We don't have to react to every piece of information. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8183.12s)]
*  This is but that that thing has come out for weeks and none of us have gone done the research. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8187.12s)]
*  That's more what I'm trying to say. And I agree with you, we don't have to. But that's why it's [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8191.200000000001s)]
*  effective. Because one, there's a whole bunch of anti-Semites on the internet that would love for [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8194.720000000001s)]
*  his shit to be true. Yeah. Right. But two, because we just accepted this reality that he threw a [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8198.560000000001s)]
*  fucking nuclear bomb in the middle of, and then none of us could defend it in that moment. Yeah. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8206.32s)]
*  Every World War Two historian is trying to debate the guy, which to me shows that he's [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8211.92s)]
*  a little bit of a fugazi. But that's what I was saying. He chose the language in that moment to [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8219.28s)]
*  not specify Jews so that they could say, wait, I was talking about people. Yes, I'm sure he would [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8223.52s)]
*  get bodied by a World War Two journalist, 100%. But what he is exposing, which I think is interesting, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8228.24s)]
*  is that accepted cultural mythology is something most of us cannot defend because it is so... [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8235.04s)]
*  It's accepted. It's so accepted. And it's so ubiquitous that you would never even get push [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8243.68s)]
*  back from a person like in our life. Yeah, we never think to... This is what we all are taught, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8248.8s)]
*  this is what we all agree on. We've all agreed upon this as a society. Who needs to find any evidence [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8253.279999999999s)]
*  to support something we've all agreed on as a society? If everybody in the world is religious, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8257.679999999998s)]
*  I don't got to prove God exists. There's no atheist. Great, exactly. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8262.08s)]
*  And then if one guy is like, God doesn't really... You know what? Well, especially when the start of [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8266.56s)]
*  the episode is like this guy Tucker is putting on a platform, this is the voice, the greatest [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8270.88s)]
*  historian, you're like, damn, I already did all the work when I was a kid and watching the movies, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8275.92s)]
*  and now all of a sudden one podcast and it's all fucking out the window. And to Andrew's point, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8280.48s)]
*  this might have been a cool, interesting discussion if you had someone who was willing [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8283.6s)]
*  to give him pushback and have a healthy discourse. Hey, let's do this on friendly terms, you're [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8286.8s)]
*  providing an alternate point of view. I obviously don't agree with it. Let's talk this out. Because [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8290.72s)]
*  if somebody was well-versed enough to be like, okay, I know what you're referencing with that [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8294.64s)]
*  message, but here's a clear letter from Hitler to Goebbels where he says, the only path forward is [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8300.24s)]
*  to eradicate the Jewish people. What do you say to that? And then he goes, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8307.92s)]
*  And for all those listening at home, that's what happened. The Wannsee Conference, Final Solution, [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8314.4s)]
*  all that stuff's real. But that's great that you can reference it, but let's find that, [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8318.16s)]
*  find the line. And that completely discredits what this guy says. You also don't need to know [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8323.44s)]
*  everything, though. If someone brings up a counterpoint, I think one thing is you could [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8327.52s)]
*  just be like, oh, I've never looked into this. I don't know the information offhand. I need to [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8332.0s)]
*  think about it. I think not knowing is also fine. And then also not needing to know. Being like, [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8335.84s)]
*  this doesn't really affect me. It's not above my line of personal intrigue. It doesn't really [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8340.48s)]
*  matter at the current impasse, so I'm not going to look at it. I think that that's a great point [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8346.08s)]
*  just for life in general. I think with this specific thing that there is so much cultural [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8349.84s)]
*  mythology built in specifically for Jews, to hear this alternative version of something that [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8355.2s)]
*  is so near and dear to their identity, their parents' identity, to hear this other take [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8364.0s)]
*  where it's kind of flippantly thrown out, that they weren't really targeted, they were just part [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8370.880000000001s)]
*  of the prisoner's war. I think that's triggering. And I think when deconstructing cultural [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8375.52s)]
*  mythology, I think you should take care to try to couch it in what your intention is. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8381.12s)]
*  So like, okay, here's the thing that's going to go against what you think. This is not trying to [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8386.080000000002s)]
*  justify the flagrant antisemitism that's been happening in pervasive and culture lately. This [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8390.160000000002s)]
*  is not trying to say that the Jews did World War II. This is just to bring up a more nuanced [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8394.880000000001s)]
*  counterpoint to this one specific thing. And you can use that to frame your belief unless you are [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8399.2s)]
*  trying to cause that point. But like he said, and I thought that this was the most telling part of [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8404.0s)]
*  the whole interview, and this is the lens I looked through it. Like he said to his friends, [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8411.04s)]
*  I wanted to antagonize him. I wanted to speak hyperbolically. And I think that is what he [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8417.2s)]
*  gets off on. I think this guy loves the fact that the internet is going crazy because that's why he [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8424.72s)]
*  looks at that's why he defended Jim Jones and that whole thing. That was completely [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8430.88s)]
*  misrepresented. He's actually a civil rights hero. Like this is what he does. Like we're saying, [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8435.519999999999s)]
*  it's a comedian taking a contrary take. Which I think an intelligence officer. What was [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8440.08s)]
*  I think he was something. But I think that's contrary to what the goal of a historian should [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8444.56s)]
*  be. I think it should be ideally trying to look at truth and examine it and not to antagonize. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8448.48s)]
*  He's doing it for him. Yeah, his goal is to make money. I don't know why he's doing it. But if that [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8452.56s)]
*  is the case, to antagonize instead of truth, I think it's I think we can safely extrapolate [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8456.08s)]
*  he's in it to make money as opposed to be a historian. I don't know. I don't even know [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8460.32s)]
*  if it's money Akash. I literally think it might be like. He's in it for him. You said it better. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8464.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's an ego thing there. Whereas if you're a true historian, ideally it has nothing to do [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8467.68s)]
*  with you. Yeah. You understand how small you are. Yeah. Like you're honoring the events. Yeah. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8473.36s)]
*  Okay. Guys, listen, that's been another episode of Flakrant. Thank you guys so much for tuning in. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVMvPDNJsQ&t=8479.52s)]
