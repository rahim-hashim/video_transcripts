# Why Trump is Covering for Epstein & How Diddy Got Off
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to Flagrant Free Jizz Lane. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=0.0s)]
*  She has been wrongly imprisoned. She was convicted guilty of something that clearly never happened. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3.0s)]
*  Never happened? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=8.0s)]
*  After the FBI's incredible research, shout out to cockeyed Cash Patel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=8.5s)]
*  That mother-fucker was looking at the documents double time and he was 100% certain that there was no Rico Charger. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=13.5s)]
*  No foul play. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=21.0s)]
*  No, no, he's a pedophile. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=21.5s)]
*  But just him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=22.5s)]
*  But only him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=23.5s)]
*  Thousands of girls, just him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the guy was busy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=25.5s)]
*  And that list that they said that they had was a list of one name. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=26.5s)]
*  Guys, what the hell is going on? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=29.0s)]
*  We owe a lot of people an apology. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=31.0s)]
*  This poor big-titted whore wrangler. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=33.0s)]
*  Let's get a picture. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=37.0s)]
*  She's not even a whore. Child wrangler. Excuse me, child wrangler. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=38.0s)]
*  Jizz Lane Massimo has been locked up in Maine or Vermont or whatever cush prison she's in for no fucking reason. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=41.0s)]
*  Does nobody feel bad about this unbelievable injustice that she's experiencing? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah, the real victim of this whole thing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=50.0s)]
*  Is Jizz Lane. And this guy who killed himself for nothing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=52.0s)]
*  Forgetting massages from underage girls. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=55.0s)]
*  Like Alex doesn't do that in Chinatown after W2F recordings every single week. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=57.0s)]
*  You never asked. You never asked how old they are in Chinatown just because. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't really tell. It could be 13 or 13. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=64.0s)]
*  I'm not judging that man when you've been down there in Chinatown not asking. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=66.0s)]
*  It's not 80, but they look 60. I think I'm safe. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, if they always look 20 years younger. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=71.0s)]
*  They always look a little bit younger. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm safe. I'm safe. I'm safe. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=76.0s)]
*  All right, we believe you're safe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=78.0s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah, Alex asked for the old ones. He wants the new ones. Give me the oldest one you got. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=80.0s)]
*  Speaking of Alex... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=83.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=85.0s)]
*  No, I'm just gonna say that this is an abortion of justice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=86.0s)]
*  This is an abortion of justice. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=92.0s)]
*  Get her in the bathing suit so we can apologize. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have to look at Jizz Lane in the bathing suit where she looks far more innocent. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=100.0s)]
*  I'll be honest, when I saw her in that bathing suit, I always thought she was innocent. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=103.0s)]
*  That's when you realized. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=107.0s)]
*  No, fuck. Oh. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=108.0s)]
*  Look at that bikini. How you... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=109.0s)]
*  It's just an American flag bikini. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=110.0s)]
*  She's a patriot and we got her locked up for no reason. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=112.0s)]
*  She's still a child ranger, Gus. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=114.0s)]
*  No, she's a wrangler. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=116.0s)]
*  She's a child wrangler and then the child ranger is Jeffrey Epstein alone. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=117.0s)]
*  Nobody else. I mean, there's nobody else had anything to do with it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=122.0s)]
*  Yes, one of the richest men in America, Les Wexner, gave him full power of attorney over his estate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=126.0s)]
*  Gave him quite possibly the most expensive apartment in the world. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=132.0s)]
*  The most expensive apartment in New York City. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=137.0s)]
*  I think it was like a whole brownstone at one point in time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=140.0s)]
*  Just handed over to him and indeed gave him the power attorney to his billions of dollars. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=142.0s)]
*  Yes, that happened when he has no actual skill set whatsoever. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=146.0s)]
*  Can you give us an apartment? Like, what's up? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=150.0s)]
*  I thought that was friendship. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=152.0s)]
*  I thought that was friendship. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=154.0s)]
*  Les is a real woman. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=156.0s)]
*  Mark won't even let Miles stay at his house for two nights. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=157.0s)]
*  Can we talk about this? Can we really talk about that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=159.0s)]
*  We thought that we're friends, right? All of us here over a decade of friendship. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=162.0s)]
*  I mean, combined. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=166.0s)]
*  Can I get a couch in the hand? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=168.0s)]
*  Combined? That's some Epstein math right there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=170.0s)]
*  No, I'm still 30 years old. Combined. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=172.0s)]
*  No, it's like, I've been friends with Akash for 10 years and I'm not friends with you guys. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=174.0s)]
*  So, at least a decade of friendship. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=180.0s)]
*  There's a decade of friendship. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=184.0s)]
*  Until you get an apartment, I don't believe it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=186.0s)]
*  You're the same as us. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=188.0s)]
*  But I don't think that we've been treating each other as real friends. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=189.0s)]
*  We've had loyalty and support and kindness and love, but there's no point in time where I just gave you power of attorney over my finances. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=192.0s)]
*  I never gave you a building. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=200.0s)]
*  We could look into this. We could start today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=201.0s)]
*  Considering everything we've done for you, I gave you a Dom Perignon bottle. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=203.0s)]
*  You gave me the Lenny Kravitz Dom Perignon bottle. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=207.0s)]
*  That's fine. That's a collect design. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=209.0s)]
*  And now the value of that has gone up so much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=211.0s)]
*  By the way, Akash gave you Solana, which is zero, and that Dom Pee... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=213.0s)]
*  I wish I gave you Solana. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=217.0s)]
*  It's actually a better gift. Let the record show. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=220.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. You know what? I should take that back. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=222.0s)]
*  And I appreciate that. You getting me the Lenny Kravitz Dom Perignon is one of the greatest. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=225.0s)]
*  I think that was a gift for my marriage. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=231.0s)]
*  I believe I got married and you decided to get me a Lenny Kravitz bottle of Dom Perignon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=233.0s)]
*  It's the only one they had. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was the only one they had. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=239.0s)]
*  So you got me the one nobody wanted. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=242.0s)]
*  That was your thoughtful gift? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=244.0s)]
*  It glows in the dark. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=246.0s)]
*  Imagine one night he's opening it up and now his wife sees a hotter guy there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=248.0s)]
*  He's not on the bottle. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=253.0s)]
*  You think there's a picture of Lenny Kravitz in it? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=257.0s)]
*  I did it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=259.0s)]
*  It might as well. What is it going for now, bro? It's easily 250 bucks now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=261.0s)]
*  Oh! It's gone up a lot, okay? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=267.0s)]
*  That's a thousand dollar bottle of champagne? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=270.0s)]
*  I thought it was like a 30 dollar bottle of champagne. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=273.0s)]
*  No! Dom Perignon is expensive. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=275.0s)]
*  I don't look up the prices of gifts. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=277.0s)]
*  Lenny Kravitz edition, dude. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=280.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=282.0s)]
*  That's a thousand dollar bottle of champagne. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=283.0s)]
*  That's definitely worth more than mine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=285.0s)]
*  I should have told you to sell it that day. It was 7,500. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=290.0s)]
*  Then the next day it went down to like 3,000. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=292.0s)]
*  You're going to sell it that day. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=295.0s)]
*  God, listen. Free just laying down. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=297.0s)]
*  Give him a gift. Sell it immediately. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=299.0s)]
*  $75, $8K right there. Bang! [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=301.0s)]
*  Free the lame, bro. I wish it well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=304.0s)]
*  Listen, and here's the reality. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=306.0s)]
*  I don't wish it well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=308.0s)]
*  Can we just address something? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=309.0s)]
*  People make mistakes when they speak a lot, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=311.0s)]
*  Like when Pam Bondi was like, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=313.0s)]
*  the videos are so vile of all the sex porn, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=315.0s)]
*  Like the district attorney, is that what her... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=319.0s)]
*  What does she do? What is her position? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=321.0s)]
*  What is her... Do we know? I don't know. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=323.0s)]
*  The official one? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=325.0s)]
*  There's no facts. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=326.0s)]
*  Pam Bondi. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=327.0s)]
*  She works for Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=328.0s)]
*  That's all we need to know. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=329.0s)]
*  Just Trump's bitch. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=330.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=331.0s)]
*  Attorney general, not just the... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=332.0s)]
*  That's her official title. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=333.0s)]
*  Attorney general. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=334.0s)]
*  Is the attorney general just the district attorney for the country? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=335.0s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=337.0s)]
*  Yeah, the district is the country attorney. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=338.0s)]
*  The country attorney. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=339.0s)]
*  Got it. Okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=340.0s)]
*  So yeah, when she came out and said that the list was there, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=341.0s)]
*  the client list was there, the files were there, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=343.0s)]
*  that the videos, the tons of the videos were there, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=346.0s)]
*  she now is saying she misspoke. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=349.0s)]
*  She just said that the thing was on her desk. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=351.0s)]
*  The files, the case files. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah, that happens. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=356.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=357.0s)]
*  Don't you misspeak about like thousands of hours of footage [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=358.0s)]
*  of adults having sex with children? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=361.0s)]
*  Isn't that something you would misspeak about? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=363.0s)]
*  You would be a little flippant in the way that you described that, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=365.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=367.0s)]
*  You would oopsie-daisy that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=368.0s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=369.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=370.0s)]
*  I go to your wedding, you go, where's my gift? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=371.0s)]
*  I say, it's on my desk right now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=372.0s)]
*  I promise it's not sitting on a liquor store alone, okay? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=374.0s)]
*  It is on my desk today. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=377.0s)]
*  What do you think the guy said when you walked out of the liquor store? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=379.0s)]
*  You think he was like, man, I didn't think that there was people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=383.0s)]
*  that fucking retarded that would buy a Lenny Kravitz edition. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=385.0s)]
*  You know, it doesn't even say Lenny Kravitz on the bottle. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=389.0s)]
*  How did you know it was Lenny Kravitz edition? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=391.0s)]
*  He just told him that in the liquor store. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=393.0s)]
*  And he believed it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=395.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=396.0s)]
*  That's not true, bro. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=397.0s)]
*  He definitely thought it would be a girl buying that bottle. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=399.0s)]
*  He's like, who's this? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=401.0s)]
*  This bitch. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=403.0s)]
*  Al, did you just misspeak? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=405.0s)]
*  Oh, I misspoke. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=407.0s)]
*  I think you misspoke. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=408.0s)]
*  I misspoke. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=409.0s)]
*  My bad, my bad. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=410.0s)]
*  I think you misspoke. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=411.0s)]
*  It had to be the only bottle left because why? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=412.0s)]
*  I've never heard Schultz utter the term Lenny or Kravitz in my life. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=413.0s)]
*  I don't even know why I heard him talk about Zoe Kravitz. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=418.0s)]
*  Proud, proud, proud graduate of PS6. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=420.0s)]
*  Oh, y'all both went to the same elementary school? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=423.0s)]
*  Went to the same elementary school. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=425.0s)]
*  It goes so deep. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=426.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=427.0s)]
*  Like that's what kind of a first. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=428.0s)]
*  Speaking of Epstein. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=429.0s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=430.0s)]
*  Proud graduate of PS6. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=431.0s)]
*  You went for 25 years, actually. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=434.0s)]
*  So, speaking of Epstein, you know, for the 100 year, for the centennial, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=436.0s)]
*  they dug open this, you know, the thing that you put underground. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=440.0s)]
*  Time capsule. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=444.0s)]
*  Time capsule, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=445.0s)]
*  So they dug open a time capsule and I was at the school during that time. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=446.0s)]
*  My dad even went to PS6 and the centennial was on a Friday or something like that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=449.0s)]
*  On a Thursday, this black dude with dreads and his shirt unbuttoned was just walking [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=454.0s)]
*  the perimeter of the yard, just kind of looking in and seeing what's going on. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=459.0s)]
*  And all the kids were like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=463.0s)]
*  This is kind of peculiar. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=466.0s)]
*  The teachers were asking around. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=467.0s)]
*  Apparently he mixed up the days of the centennial. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=469.0s)]
*  Like he wanted to come on the Friday, but thought it was a Thursday. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=471.0s)]
*  So he's just stalking the gates, bearing the children with an unbuttoned shirt on the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=475.0s)]
*  upper east side and didn't get arrested. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=480.0s)]
*  That's what America used to be before Mamdani came in. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah, in Giuliani's America, black guys could walk around freely. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=487.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=490.0s)]
*  So he was on the subway in Brooklyn. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=491.0s)]
*  Now Mamdani's out here kicking the Jews out. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=493.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=496.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=497.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=498.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=499.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=503.0s)]
*  So can we just kind of understand what's going on? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=504.0s)]
*  Can we understand what's going on here? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=506.0s)]
*  Because obviously this whole blackmail ring that has tied in American presidents, Israeli [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=508.0s)]
*  prime ministers, the royal family, this is all allegedly, obviously. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=516.0s)]
*  Now that we know that that is completely false and all these people were just good friends. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=520.0s)]
*  They were just like hanging out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=525.0s)]
*  Like Bill Gates going to like someone who has already been convicted of pedophilia, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=526.0s)]
*  just go in his house to talk business is like a normal thing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=531.0s)]
*  There's no way that this is like some entrenched blackmail scheme, intelligence scheme. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=534.0s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=539.0s)]
*  That would be impossible, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=540.0s)]
*  Because yeah, if you're Bill Gates, like you would have so much to lose going to a pedophile's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=542.0s)]
*  house. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=547.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=548.0s)]
*  Why would you do business with that guy? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=549.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=550.0s)]
*  So he must be a big misunderstanding. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=551.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=552.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=553.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=554.0s)]
*  Why would you go to Prince Andrew? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=555.0s)]
*  Because isn't he already besmirched? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=556.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=557.0s)]
*  But now I think we got to forgive him. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=558.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=560.0s)]
*  We got to forgive him. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=561.0s)]
*  Yeah, we just took a picture. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=562.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=563.0s)]
*  We just took a picture of the girl who accused him of being a pedophile. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=564.0s)]
*  And then like, I mean, why don't we just ask that girl one more time? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=567.0s)]
*  If that girl, if. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=571.0s)]
*  RIP. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=572.0s)]
*  Oh, oh, she's dead. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=574.0s)]
*  She took her own life. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=575.0s)]
*  Probably from lying. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=576.0s)]
*  That was the guilt of lying about it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=577.0s)]
*  That's what got her. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=579.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=581.0s)]
*  She was obviously. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=582.0s)]
*  Hey, we got to believe. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=583.0s)]
*  We gotta believe these guys. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=584.0s)]
*  So this woman's a liar, all these women are liars. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=585.04s)]
*  Listen. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=587.64s)]
*  And, oh, what are you gonna do? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=588.48s)]
*  Akash, as Kakad Kash said, he said, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=589.8s)]
*  we cannot re-victimize these girls. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=592.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=594.04s)]
*  Right, because that's what these girls want the most. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=594.86s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=596.64s)]
*  They don't want justice that they've been clamoring for [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=597.48s)]
*  for the last few decades. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=599.78s)]
*  They don't wanna be re-victimized. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=601.28s)]
*  So every time they say, hey, please, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=603.68s)]
*  can you just get those bad guys who fucked us up a lot? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=605.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=608.12s)]
*  What do you think they mean when they say that? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=608.94s)]
*  Don't victimize me. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=610.88s)]
*  Don't victimize me. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=611.72s)]
*  Do it, but don't do it through re-victimization. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  I've already been through being a victim once. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  This is worst victimhood, is justice. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=617.04s)]
*  So you're talking about there's a thousand girls [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=619.3599999999999s)]
*  that have been raped by Epstein and none of his cohorts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=624.7199999999999s)]
*  None of his cohorts. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=625.56s)]
*  So they should be celebrating. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=626.38s)]
*  None of them wanna be? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  The only guy. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=628.56s)]
*  Say it again. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=629.4s)]
*  They should be celebrating [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=630.2399999999999s)]
*  because they got the only guy. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=632.5999999999999s)]
*  Finally, justice is served. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  Justice. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=634.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=635.3599999999999s)]
*  And they released the footage from the cell [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=636.18s)]
*  the two floors down from them. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=638.4s)]
*  It wasn't even his cell? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=641.0s)]
*  It's like around the corner. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=643.52s)]
*  Coffeezilla the legend was on the case immediately. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=644.36s)]
*  Shout out to Suspenders. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=646.4s)]
*  God, I love this guy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=647.24s)]
*  Love you, dog. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  He did like a whole sort of like 10 minute video [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=649.04s)]
*  on the video, on the 10 hours that was released [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  from the jail. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  And? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=654.92s)]
*  Which originally they said there was like no video tape [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=655.76s)]
*  of his cell, so they released footage nearby [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=656.84s)]
*  that his cell is actually like around the corner, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=659.0s)]
*  like up the stairs or some shit. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=661.12s)]
*  Oh, what a, you know. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=661.96s)]
*  And so they show the video with a minute missing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=663.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=665.72s)]
*  That minute, according to Pan Bondi, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=666.6s)]
*  is from when the cameras like reset. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=668.52s)]
*  So you know, like you got the footage [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=671.24s)]
*  and then it resets. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=673.36s)]
*  So like basically the camera goes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=674.7600000000001s)]
*  That's a good recording device, Mark. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=676.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=678.24s)]
*  Like if you wanted a recording device [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=679.08s)]
*  to record every second of a day [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=680.08s)]
*  just in case something happened. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=682.36s)]
*  In a very high security prison. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  It would probably be the highest security jail [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=687.6s)]
*  It would probably be pretty smart [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=688.44s)]
*  for there to just be a minute long gap. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=691.6400000000001s)]
*  Like periodically, like over and over. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=692.48s)]
*  By the way. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=693.8800000000001s)]
*  In the suicide watch section of all sessions. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=694.72s)]
*  In the suicide watch section. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=695.96s)]
*  And by the way, there was no video. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=697.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=699.44s)]
*  The other cameras. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=700.5200000000001s)]
*  It was gonna function 10 days before. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=701.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=702.84s)]
*  Stopped recording 10 days before. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  But you know what that is, you film your stand up shows. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=705.52s)]
*  All the time. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=707.32s)]
*  And then you'll film and then one minute [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=708.16s)]
*  in the middle of your hour. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=710.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=710.84s)]
*  It'll reset. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=712.52s)]
*  And then whenever it resets, that's a minute. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=713.36s)]
*  There is an opportunity for a camera company to. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=715.6s)]
*  I had a guy commit suicide at my show. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=717.36s)]
*  It was during the minute that the camera was resetting. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=718.96s)]
*  Don't you hate that? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=720.48s)]
*  It could have been a clip. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=721.32s)]
*  It could have been a clip, dude. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=722.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=723.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=723.84s)]
*  And so they said you killed on stage. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  But technically he didn't kill. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=726.24s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=728.72s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=730.4s)]
*  I look at a show. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=732.12s)]
*  Like, wow, these members are killing themselves. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=732.96s)]
*  But they said that they're gonna release footage [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=735.44s)]
*  from the day before and the day after [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=737.24s)]
*  to prove. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=738.8s)]
*  That the minute's missing. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=739.88s)]
*  That the minute misses every single day at the same time [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=740.84s)]
*  because every day records. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=743.72s)]
*  Oh, that's, you can't doctor that in every set. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=745.8s)]
*  Now question. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  They got some slow ass editors, man. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=749.4s)]
*  Is there any way. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=750.24s)]
*  Is there any way. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=751.08s)]
*  Is there any way that they can get us the footage [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=752.32s)]
*  of the cell or of a cell close to his? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=755.6s)]
*  Can we see the people moving around? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=759.24s)]
*  I don't think prisons have surveillance like that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=760.08s)]
*  I think they just film in the corners. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=763.88s)]
*  Only corners. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=764.72s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, in the most technologically advanced country [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  in the history of the world, it makes sense. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=769.44s)]
*  This is from years ago, bro. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=771.12s)]
*  This is from 2019. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=771.96s)]
*  Full of criminals. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=772.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, 2019. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=773.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  Did we even have cameras back then? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=775.64s)]
*  I don't even think so. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=776.48s)]
*  This is filmed on a fucking beeper, bro. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=777.32s)]
*  They don't have any of that shit. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=779.5200000000001s)]
*  This is years ago. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=780.36s)]
*  Yeah, why did we fall for this? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=781.1800000000001s)]
*  Why do we fall for it every time? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=784.44s)]
*  Why are we so gullible? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=786.2s)]
*  We're the idiots, honestly. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=787.24s)]
*  We really are. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=788.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=789.1600000000001s)]
*  It's really on us. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=790.92s)]
*  Why do we, we're such crazy conspiracy theorists. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=792.16s)]
*  Why do we wanna believe that there's a blackmail ring [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=794.76s)]
*  where they're honeypotting with underage girls? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=797.88s)]
*  Why do we want that? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=799.56s)]
*  What's wrong with us? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=800.44s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=801.6s)]
*  There's no smoke here at all. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=802.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=803.56s)]
*  It's just us, just running wild with our imaginations. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=804.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=806.4s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=807.24s)]
*  Why is Trump dog not running for it? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=808.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=810.52s)]

*  Oh, this is so funny, by the way, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=815.56s)]
*  in the full context of understanding what's going on. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=816.92s)]
*  Because he's doing a press, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=819.88s)]
*  like basically a press conference [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  regarding these horrific floods that happened in Texas [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=823.36s)]
*  where many children got swept away. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=826.6s)]

*  He's talking about children's lives. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=830.64s)]
*  Then they bring up Epstein and he's like, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=833.24s)]
*  what are you bringing up Epstein for? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  We're talking about kids that are missing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=836.24s)]

*  What are you, why are you keep talking about it? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=840.8s)]
*  And I'm disappointed in Trump, man. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=842.1999999999999s)]
*  He didn't go to Texas and Steph Curry [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=843.64s)]
*  some paper towel roll and shit like that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=845.36s)]
*  Like, come on, bro. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=848.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=849.64s)]
*  Used to stand for something. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=850.8s)]
*  It would have been so funny. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=852.76s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=855.0s)]

*  I don't like answering. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=874.64s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe you're asking a question [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  at Epstein at a time like this [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=878.0s)]
*  where we're having some of the greatest success [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=879.52s)]
*  and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=882.48s)]
*  It just seems like a desecration, but you go ahead. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=886.28s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=890.72s)]
*  First to back up on that in February. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=891.56s)]
*  So we're stupid. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=893.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=895.16s)]
*  We're the fucking idiots, guys. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=896.24s)]
*  Just to let you know, we're wasting time. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=898.04s)]
*  And look at us. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=898.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=899.72s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=901.56s)]
*  That is, like in all seriousness, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=902.48s)]
*  that is, I think what is enraging people right now [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=904.0s)]
*  is it's insulting our intelligence. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=908.32s)]
*  Like obviously the intelligence community [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=910.36s)]
*  is trying to cover it up. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  Obviously the Trump administration is trying to cover up. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=913.1600000000001s)]
*  Something changed because they ran on this idea [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=915.64s)]
*  of exposing it all. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=918.36s)]
*  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=919.2s)]
*  All these guys had great ideas, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=920.0400000000001s)]
*  Cackeye Cash, Dan Bongino. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=921.36s)]
*  He had clips, dog, he had bars. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=922.72s)]
*  He was ready to tear it all down. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=924.84s)]
*  He was ready to tear down the entire FBI office. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=926.48s)]
*  Shut down the Hoover building day one. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=928.48s)]
*  Day one. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=930.32s)]
*  Then, bitch, still standing. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=931.1600000000001s)]
*  Then he goes on Joe Rogan and he's like, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=932.16s)]
*  listen, do you think if I had it, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=934.44s)]
*  I wouldn't share it with you? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=936.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=937.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=938.12s)]
*  I do. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=938.96s)]
*  I do believe that 100%. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=939.8s)]
*  Especially when you're staring at me like this, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=941.16s)]
*  telling me that. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=942.8s)]
*  How cockeyed is he? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=943.64s)]
*  Can we get a photo of him really quick? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=945.36s)]
*  Once you protect pedophiles, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=947.04s)]
*  you are the most cockeyed person in the entire world. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=948.68s)]
*  I never called him cockeyed Cash before this. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=950.92s)]
*  He couldn't see all the other people raping the children. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=952.76s)]
*  He could only see him. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=954.68s)]
*  He's just staring at the bridge of his nose. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=955.52s)]
*  I don't see anything over here. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=957.4s)]
*  I watched all 3,000 hours of footage. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=958.96s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong on this, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=961.6s)]
*  but okay, you keep talking about this Epstein, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=963.96s)]
*  they keep talking about this Epstein list. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=965.56s)]
*  I got the list on my desk. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=967.16s)]
*  Now they're saying nothing happened. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=968.92s)]
*  So one of two things in my mind is impossible. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=970.04s)]
*  One, you're covering it up. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=972.16s)]
*  Or two, nothing really happened [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=973.8s)]
*  and you exploited the rape of thousands of children [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=975.48s)]
*  to get your man elected. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=978.32s)]
*  So which one do you want here? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=979.92s)]
*  Because that one to me sounds just as bad if not worse. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=982.0s)]
*  Also guys, show dates. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=985.4s)]

*  That no more, no less. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1048.68s)]
*  One perfect hour. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1049.88s)]
*  Or 50 minutes in a blow job. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1050.96s)]
*  See you guys at the shows. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1052.68s)]
*  And if you want to see Mark in New York City, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1053.88s)]
*  go to Cancel Comedy X on IG. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1056.2s)]
*  Tickets in the bio. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1058.8s)]
*  Let's go through both scenarios. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1060.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1061.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1062.56s)]
*  Let's go for the first one of covering it up. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1063.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1064.84s)]
*  So what does covering it up mean? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1065.68s)]
*  Either there's an intelligence operation that's happening [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1067.52s)]
*  within the United States that is aiding [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1071.32s)]
*  and abetting the exploitation of children. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1073.76s)]
*  It's not great. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1076.4s)]
*  Our taxpayer dollars go to this [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1077.24s)]
*  and some type of CIA black budget. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  So we're now complicit in this thing, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1080.48s)]
*  but it's for the greater good of America. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1082.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1084.52s)]
*  So we kind of are like, I don't know, I'm fine. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  Or Trump is implicated in some direct way [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1086.44s)]
*  because obviously he knew Jeffrey Epstein [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1088.64s)]
*  from back in the day. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1090.2s)]
*  Or both of those things. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1091.44s)]
*  So let's talk about these two scenarios. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1092.72s)]
*  So if this is an intelligence operation, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1094.92s)]
*  like I remember when people were blaming it on Israel, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  it would be better if it was another country. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  Like wouldn't you rather your own country [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1105.4s)]
*  did not be the one that was plotting, planning [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1108.16s)]
*  and exploiting these little girls like this. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1110.72s)]
*  You would hope it was another country. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1112.52s)]
*  But let's say, for example, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1114.24s)]
*  it is an American intelligence. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's America and Israel. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  That's kind of what it feels like. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1119.44s)]
*  I mean, there's like an insane amount of ties to Israel [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1120.48s)]
*  in this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1123.4s)]
*  But let's say it is an intelligence operation [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1124.96s)]
*  like you just said, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1126.6000000000001s)]

*  Do you wanna tell the entire country [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1142.58s)]

*  I'm just asking you guys. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1167.1799999999998s)]
*  I just wanna explore that one for a second. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1168.02s)]
*  I mean, if you'd imagine that in order to keep [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1170.26s)]
*  the files from coming out, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1172.6s)]
*  it's gotta go all the way to the top is my assumption. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1173.5s)]
*  Unless there's some type of like hidden degree [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1175.82s)]
*  where it's like, hey, we're gonna protect him [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1177.7399999999998s)]
*  from information so that he doesn't sound crazy [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1179.1s)]
*  and he can just kind of run with [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1181.4599999999998s)]
*  whatever the mainstream narrative is. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1183.1s)]
*  But the fact that his tune has even switched up [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1184.4599999999998s)]
*  leads me to believe that he has an info. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1186.3799999999999s)]
*  He knows something. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1187.54s)]
*  So the reason he knows it, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1189.7399999999998s)]
*  because he's like, we're gonna showcase, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1191.34s)]
*  we're gonna talk about this guy. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1193.86s)]
*  They ran on it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1195.1799999999998s)]
*  They ran on cleaning out the swamp. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1196.02s)]
*  They ran on all these. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1197.74s)]
*  They brought all the influencers, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1198.58s)]
*  gave them all binders with all the shit [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1199.4599999999998s)]
*  that was all redacted. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1200.8999999999999s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1202.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1203.4599999999998s)]
*  They tried to promote this. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1204.3s)]
*  They were building this excitement up [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1205.74s)]
*  for us to just get, I don't know, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1207.8999999999999s)]
*  what is the term, like the wind taken out of our sails? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1210.5s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1213.06s)]
*  So the fact that his tune has changed to, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1214.86s)]
*  from hey, let's have a social media moment [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1217.26s)]
*  with the binders to, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1219.5s)]
*  you guys are still talking about this guy? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1220.7s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about it because of you. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1222.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1223.46s)]
*  You're the one that keeps the conversation going [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1224.3000000000002s)]
*  when you hand out the binders [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1225.98s)]
*  to the social media influencers. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1226.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1228.1000000000001s)]
*  You're the one that keeps the conversation going [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1228.94s)]
*  when your FBI director goes on podcasts [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1229.8600000000001s)]
*  and says nothing happened, he killed himself. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1232.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1234.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1235.8200000000002s)]
*  So it has to go to him. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1236.66s)]
*  Especially for him to go, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
*  why are you guys still talking about this? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1240.94s)]
*  Because you wanted us to talk about it. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1242.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1243.8600000000001s)]
*  You promoted it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1244.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1245.5400000000002s)]
*  There is a possibility that it's not directly CIA or FBI. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1246.38s)]
*  Sometimes this happens with like military ops [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1248.5800000000002s)]
*  or like former agency guys will go off [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1251.02s)]
*  and create a shell company [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1252.82s)]
*  that kind of operates in like the gray area of the law. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1253.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1257.02s)]
*  And they'll do operations [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1257.86s)]
*  and typically it's like surveillance and shit like that. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1259.06s)]
*  And the CIA will contract them. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1261.3s)]
*  And so they operate kind of as a private company [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1263.62s)]
*  that can't be FOIAed, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1265.9399999999998s)]
*  they can't have all their files taken out. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1266.98s)]
*  And the CIA still gets all the information. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1269.1s)]
*  But either way, it's still CIA. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1271.1s)]
*  Yeah. Sure. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1272.4199999999998s)]
*  But it just gives a separation for them. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1273.3s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1276.1399999999999s)]
*  But- [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1277.1s)]
*  Epstein was doing this for over 25 years. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1277.9399999999998s)]
*  They know. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1280.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1281.78s)]
*  Listen, he's given sweetheart deals. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1282.6200000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1283.74s)]
*  Alex Acosta said on record, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1284.5800000000002s)]
*  we have this on record. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1287.0600000000002s)]
*  Alex Acosta was I think at the time [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1288.18s)]
*  the district attorney in Palm Beach. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1290.38s)]
*  Yeah, Miami Palm Beach. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1292.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1293.7s)]
*  And then later was about to be- [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1294.54s)]
*  Secretary of Labor? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1297.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1299.0600000000002s)]
*  And then had to step down because of the connections. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1299.9s)]
*  I think he was, he was Secretary of Labor [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1302.0600000000002s)]
*  and then had to step down. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1303.5s)]
*  But he said, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1304.5800000000002s)]
*  he was the guy who gave the sweetheart deal to Epstein. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1305.46s)]
*  He said, I did it because I was told he was intelligence. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1307.78s)]
*  I was told to back off. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1313.42s)]
*  Because he was intelligence. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1314.66s)]
*  That is said, that is, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1316.1s)]
*  you cannot wipe that clean from the record. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1318.1s)]
*  That has been said by a, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1320.46s)]
*  I don't wanna say trusted source, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1323.3s)]
*  but a source that is reliable [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1325.06s)]
*  and knows the weight of their words. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1326.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1328.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1329.02s)]
*  And I think that was in the hearings [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1329.86s)]
*  to become Trump's Labor Secretary. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1330.58s)]
*  Oh, I thought that that was, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1333.02s)]
*  okay, but go on. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1334.74s)]
*  I think while they're interviewing him, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1335.58s)]
*  they're like, by the way, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1336.54s)]
*  what was up with the sweetheart deal, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1337.9s)]
*  da-da-da-da, what was up with the Epstein thing? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1338.74s)]
*  Because they're looking at his whole career. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1339.8200000000002s)]
*  And a kid, I think you look at- [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1341.5800000000002s)]
*  Can you check that joke? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1342.9s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna double check that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1343.74s)]
*  I think he also said that- [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1344.5800000000002s)]
*  At the time. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1345.42s)]
*  Yeah, at the time when he gave him the sweetheart deal. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1346.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1347.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1348.2600000000002s)]
*  Because people were upset about that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1349.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1349.94s)]
*  And so, yeah, from my understanding, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1350.7800000000002s)]
*  while he's in the briefing with the Trump cabinet team, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1351.6200000000001s)]
*  he basically was like, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1354.14s)]
*  yeah, I was told to stand down. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1355.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1356.46s)]
*  From someone above me. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1357.66s)]
*  I think it was like the exact quote. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1358.5s)]
*  So to me, I think that's where we can at least, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1359.74s)]
*  we can have some confidence [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1362.7s)]
*  that he does have connections to the intelligence community. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1363.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1366.3s)]
*  So bare minimum, there's connections. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1367.14s)]
*  Maximum, this is this massive black male ring. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1369.14s)]
*  It's not only black male. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1372.62s)]
*  They've inserted themselves in governments. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1375.1s)]
*  They've served as a royal family. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1377.22s)]
*  They've served themselves in American intelligentsia. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1378.26s)]
*  The highest levels of our universities. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1380.86s)]
*  This is everywhere. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1383.18s)]
*  It's not just as much as you're a president, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1384.3s)]
*  let me go fuck you. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1386.42s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1387.26s)]
*  Let me get you to fuck a girl. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1388.1s)]
*  It's everybody. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1389.22s)]
*  It's inserting yourself in every piece of influence [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1390.22s)]
*  in American culture. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1395.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1396.82s)]
*  And the world around. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1397.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1398.5s)]
*  Okay, so Trump either is told [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1401.6200000000001s)]
*  that if we release the details on this, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1407.14s)]
*  it will destroy confidence in America at home and abroad. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1411.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1416.3s)]
*  Because what country runs a child fucking black male ring [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1417.14s)]
*  on its own people? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1421.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1423.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's a tough look. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1424.18s)]
*  And that says a lot, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1425.86s)]
*  because most military budgets go towards pretty awful things. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1426.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1429.1399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1429.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1430.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1431.66s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we're cool killing kids over there. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1432.5s)]
*  Fucking them here. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1433.34s)]
*  Yeah, dude, just do the Iraqis. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1434.54s)]
*  Don't do us. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1435.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1436.78s)]
*  Yeah, like what would the collateral damage of that be? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1437.98s)]
*  How would we react to that? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1439.9s)]
*  What if we found out our alphabet agencies were doing that? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1441.02s)]
*  Like, it wouldn't be ideal. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1443.3s)]
*  The thing I don't get is that [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1444.62s)]
*  what new information happened, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1447.3799999999999s)]
*  because Trump's first four years, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1449.18s)]
*  this is when he got locked up. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1451.7s)]
*  This is when he would have been told already. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1453.34s)]
*  That's also true, yeah. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1455.54s)]
*  That, hey, this is, he's intelligence, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1456.5s)]
*  this can compromise us, don't release it. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1459.34s)]
*  So then why would you- And then he continues to run on it. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1460.98s)]
*  That's true. Then why run on this? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1462.3s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1463.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1464.46s)]
*  I think that, okay, so let's go through that, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1465.3s)]
*  difference here. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1470.5s)]
*  There's a version where it's like, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1473.1399999999999s)]
*  because I've said this even before the pod, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1474.94s)]
*  where it's the Democrats from the Biden administration [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  had access to this, right? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1478.46s)]
*  And if Trump was in it, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1480.22s)]
*  this is like a piece of logic. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1482.06s)]
*  If Trump was in it or connected, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1483.54s)]
*  they would have used it against him. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1485.94s)]
*  Like they used everything against him. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1488.54s)]
*  They went after him for money, they went after him for, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1489.86s)]
*  I mean, like the complete power of the justice system [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1492.62s)]
*  and any other system they had at their disposal, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1495.6599999999999s)]
*  they used against Trump. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1497.62s)]
*  Unless your guys are also implicated. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1498.7s)]
*  I didn't consider that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1500.8999999999999s)]
*  I thought that Trump was clean from it [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1503.4199999999998s)]
*  because he had rallied against it so hard, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1505.3s)]
*  he'd ran on it. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1507.46s)]
*  All the people that he's hiring [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1508.6599999999999s)]
*  are people that are going after it [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1510.34s)]
*  and essentially promoting themselves on it, right? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1512.26s)]
*  But there is a version where it's like, what is it? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1516.54s)]
*  It's like a mutual short destruction. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1520.94s)]
*  So it is nukes on everybody. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1523.4199999999998s)]
*  So therefore they're like, we could go after Trump with this, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1526.78s)]
*  but by exposing Trump as part of this thing, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1530.1399999999999s)]
*  it might expose all the other people [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1533.26s)]
*  or confirm that it is an actual blackmail ring. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1535.94s)]
*  And once it's confirmed that it is an actual blackmail ring, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1538.98s)]
*  we got to see how far this goes. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1541.8999999999999s)]
*  And it might not even implicate like Democrat politicians. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1543.74s)]
*  Like it likely does, but it doesn't necessarily need to [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1546.5s)]
*  because by our guys, you could just mean the US government. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1548.86s)]
*  Yes, the intelligence community is involved in it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1551.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1554.1799999999998s)]
*  I think it's either US government or rich donors. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1555.02s)]
*  So there's a version of this where he is involved, right? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1558.02s)]
*  That's not completely clean just yet. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1562.8999999999999s)]
*  He is involved. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1564.9399999999998s)]
*  To what extent? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1565.86s)]
*  We do not know. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1566.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not like the most absurd thing, right? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1567.52s)]
*  Like the guy was partying with Epstein. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1569.8799999999999s)]
*  I think, yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1572.8799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1574.2s)]
*  His name was in the black book. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1575.04s)]
*  I think Trump's fucked a hooker or two in his life. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1576.44s)]
*  That wouldn't be like the most shocking thing to ever hear. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1578.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1581.92s)]
*  Now is he asking for ID every single time? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1582.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1586.04s)]
*  And that's probably the name of the game, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1586.86s)]
*  It's like you get the girls that are 16 or whatever to go [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1588.8s)]
*  and then the guys aren't asking questions and fuck them [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1591.16s)]
*  and now you got it all on video. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1592.96s)]
*  Also just one note on the Acasa thing. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1594.52s)]
*  So it says, when questions resurfaced in 2019 [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1596.44s)]
*  about why Epstein received such a light sentence, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  Acasa allegedly told Trump's transition team the following. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1601.72s)]
*  I was told Epstein belonged to intelligence [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  and to leave it alone. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1607.48s)]
*  So that was the exact quote. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1608.96s)]
*  So it was never like in some type of, you know, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1609.96s)]
*  like court of law where he can't purge himself. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1613.0s)]
*  Who told you that? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1615.24s)]
*  Chad G.B.T. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1616.3200000000002s)]
*  No, that's what I wanna know. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1617.16s)]
*  Alex Acasa goes, I was told that he's intelligent. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1619.0s)]
*  Who? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1621.64s)]
*  No, he's never confirmed this or denied it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1622.72s)]
*  That's alleged. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1625.28s)]
*  In a public state. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1626.6799999999998s)]
*  Do we know who said he said that? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1627.52s)]
*  Or did Trump's team say that? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1628.6799999999998s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1630.4799999999998s)]
*  I mean, again, this was in 2008 that this happened. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1631.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1633.04s)]
*  Okay, so then let's go through the other scenarios. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1634.32s)]
*  So- [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1636.52s)]
*  Trump is compromised. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1637.36s)]
*  So Trump's compromised. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1638.1999999999998s)]
*  Let's go through, there's another scenario. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1639.56s)]
*  Let's assume Trump isn't compromised. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1641.2399999999998s)]
*  But the intelligence communities come to him [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1644.1999999999998s)]
*  and they basically say, this is us, this is what we do. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1646.52s)]
*  There are a lot of people here that are gonna go down. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1650.8s)]
*  If you out this and the reality is [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1655.24s)]
*  you're not gonna out this. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1657.64s)]
*  And I would like to take this a little further. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1659.24s)]
*  There's a version where the intelligence community comes [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1661.72s)]
*  in, they go, you don't really run the country. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1663.68s)]
*  You get to make a lot of decisions and that's fine. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1666.52s)]
*  But you look the other way at the things we do. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1669.08s)]
*  And we look the other way at the things you do. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1671.04s)]
*  And then once the things you do cross paths [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1672.92s)]
*  with things that we do, we remind you [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1675.08s)]
*  that you don't really run the country. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1677.6s)]
*  And maybe that's what, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1679.28s)]
*  and I'm not trying to give Putin credit here, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1680.68s)]
*  but remember when Putin said that thing about like, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  every American president, what is it? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1684.76s)]
*  Every American president has these great ideas. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1688.32s)]
*  And then once he gets elected, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1690.16s)]
*  the real men that run the country, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1692.08s)]
*  the men in suits walk in and tell him what the deal is. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1693.64s)]
*  Oh, I was not even thinking about that. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1695.8s)]
*  I was thinking about how Putin kind of told the oligarchs [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  whenever he took over, like this is my shit. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1699.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1701.08s)]
*  And I was thinking Trump could have done that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1701.92s)]
*  So, and that wouldn't be that shocking to me [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  because the idea that like we have a new person [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1705.04s)]
*  running the country every four years or eight years [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1708.16s)]
*  and they plot the course of America for the next 300, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1710.84s)]
*  it's kind of absurd, right? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1713.4s)]
*  Like there has to be some version of permanent government. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1714.8400000000001s)]
*  Obviously it's not established [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1718.16s)]
*  and they're not like speaking about, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1720.44s)]
*  they're not shining a light on it. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1722.1200000000001s)]
*  But like there must be some version [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1723.48s)]
*  of this permanent government that like maintains the course [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1725.2800000000002s)]
*  and does fucked up shit to maintain the course, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1728.72s)]
*  just like every other country that's run as a dictatorship [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1731.92s)]
*  does fucked up shit to maintain the course. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1734.48s)]
*  So it wouldn't be shocking to me that that happened. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1736.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe he's involved, maybe he's not involved, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1738.72s)]
*  but he could have had a conversation. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1740.44s)]
*  They could have come up to him and be like, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1742.52s)]
*  you know we missed on purpose, right? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1743.76s)]
*  Like they could have sat him down in a room [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1746.6399999999999s)]
*  and be like, you know we missed on purpose, right? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1747.96s)]
*  He goes, what? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1749.28s)]
*  He goes, the guy who had the perfect shot on you [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1750.12s)]
*  from a hundred meters away or whatever, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  like we missed on purpose. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1754.48s)]
*  You didn't look at a fucking sign. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1755.84s)]
*  Looking at the sign got you closer. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  But we missed on purpose. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1760.0s)]
*  And we won't the next time unless you tell people [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1761.32s)]
*  to look the other way about this absolutely shit. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1764.24s)]
*  To me, I would not be surprised at all [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1766.72s)]
*  if the CIA and the FBI actually are running the country. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1769.48s)]
*  And we get to bicker about little shit. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1773.3600000000001s)]
*  They go, oh let them fight about abortion. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1774.72s)]
*  Let them fight about hate speech. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1777.16s)]
*  Let them fight about this. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1778.6000000000001s)]
*  But the real decisions, like if we're gonna send [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1780.44s)]
*  more fucking aid to Ukraine, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1782.28s)]
*  if we're gonna send more aid to Israel, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1783.96s)]
*  those decisions are already made [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1785.8400000000001s)]
*  because we continue to make them. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1787.1200000000001s)]
*  Despite Americans not wanting them, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1789.2s)]
*  this same fucking decision gets made, right? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1791.0s)]
*  Over and over again. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1793.8s)]
*  And this is my theory with like, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  are politicians individually corrupt? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1796.8s)]
*  Like perhaps, but I wonder if just the throne is, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1798.92s)]
*  the institution, the systems in place [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  are just inherently kind of corrupt. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1804.0400000000002s)]
*  And so you can have people like Cash, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1806.2s)]
*  who's probably working in good faith [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1807.72s)]
*  while he's campaigning and on the buildup [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1809.6000000000001s)]
*  and all of his time as a prosecutor for the state. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1811.5600000000002s)]
*  He's doing good work and then gets into role, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1815.24s)]
*  gets read in on a brief and goes, all right, nevermind. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1817.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1821.5200000000002s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1822.3600000000001s)]
*  To me, that seems like the most logical thing. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1823.4s)]
*  I believe that about Trump. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1825.96s)]
*  I believe when Trump, everything he campaigned on, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1827.0800000000002s)]
*  I believe he wanted to do. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1830.0s)]
*  And now he's doing the exact opposite thing [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1832.16s)]
*  of every single fucking thing. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1833.68s)]
*  I don't know what he's done. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1835.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly to your point. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1836.2s)]
*  If you tell me, it's easier for me to believe [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1837.44s)]
*  you wanted to do all these things [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1841.0s)]
*  if any of them were happening in the way that you said they were. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1842.8799999999999s)]
*  To that point, there'll be people that'll DM me, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1845.4s)]
*  like, you see what your boy's doing? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1847.6399999999999s)]
*  You voted for this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1849.44s)]
*  I'm like, I voted for none of this. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1850.28s)]
*  He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1853.08s)]
*  I want him to stop the wars. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1856.28s)]
*  He's funding them. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1857.48s)]
*  I want him to shrink spending, reduce the budget. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1858.36s)]
*  He's increasing it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1861.2s)]
*  It's like everything that he said he's going to do, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1862.2s)]
*  except sending immigrants back. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1865.24s)]
*  And now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1867.96s)]
*  But he's like, oh, well, we kind of need the people working [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1870.6000000000001s)]
*  in restaurants, and we need our farmers. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1872.44s)]
*  It's like everything that he said that he was going to do [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1874.4s)]
*  that he campaigned really hard on. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1876.52s)]
*  Well, he said to us, which was important, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1877.4s)]
*  and I thought it was good, he pressed him on it, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1879.28s)]
*  you've got to start with the criminals in terms of deporting. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1880.92s)]
*  I don't even know if the criminals are getting sent back. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1884.1200000000001s)]
*  I know there's a lot of people with green cards [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1887.16s)]
*  getting sent back. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1889.72s)]
*  There's people who aren't criminals getting sent back. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1890.96s)]
*  I don't know if you're sending back the criminals first. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1893.52s)]
*  You definitely don't know if they're first. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1895.4s)]
*  I don't know if you're sending them back at all. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1896.44s)]
*  So nothing has happened. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1897.92s)]
*  And you were more optimistic than I was, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1899.64s)]
*  because I judge him by his first four, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1902.2s)]
*  and it was Mr. Dream the Shwamp, Mr. Build the Wall, Mr. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1904.16s)]
*  Like, he didn't do a lot of the stuff [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1907.76s)]
*  he promised in the first four, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1909.32s)]
*  so why would anything ever get done? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1910.48s)]
*  I already expect politicians [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1912.4s)]
*  to not do most of the shit they say. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1914.3600000000001s)]
*  And now, and I don't want to be like too cynical, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1917.44s)]
*  but now I'm getting to the point where it's like, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1919.72s)]
*  can they do anything? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1923.64s)]
*  I think the reason why, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  and I don't know if this is necessarily intelligent, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1926.92s)]
*  but I think the reason why Mamdani is exciting to people [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1929.16s)]
*  is the same reason why Trump was exciting to people. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1932.28s)]
*  When you are so fed up with the status quo, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1934.96s)]
*  when you feel like the status quo will do nothing [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1937.8s)]
*  and change nothing, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1939.92s)]
*  you have way more of a longer leash [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1942.0s)]
*  for the outsider's ideas [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1946.72s)]
*  than you do the status quo's ideas. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1948.72s)]
*  Whatever Cuomo says, I don't even know if I believe it, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1950.32s)]
*  because he's status quo. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1952.92s)]
*  So I'm like, it's just gonna be the same old [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1954.32s)]
*  fucking bullshit. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1955.72s)]
*  Mamdani comes in with these wild ideas that he cannot do, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1956.64s)]
*  like most of them, he literally just physically [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1959.48s)]
*  cannot do them, but people are so, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1961.44s)]
*  and I'm putting this under quotes, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1964.28s)]
*  desperate for something else. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1965.28s)]
*  They're like, maybe he'll pull it off. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1967.16s)]
*  And I think that was the idea with Trump, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  it was like, maybe he will stop these wars, no. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1970.52s)]
*  Maybe we will see what's up with his apps and shit, no. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1973.4s)]
*  And I'll take this a step further with what we talked about. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1975.68s)]
*  We talked about on Patreon, with Mamdani, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1977.8s)]
*  I like that he might even endeavor to do these things. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1979.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1982.72s)]
*  I don't, that was the term we kept using. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1983.56s)]
*  I don't even see Trump endeavoring to do any of the things [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1985.1599999999999s)]
*  that he said he was gonna do. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1988.12s)]
*  Seems like he's just as much the big problem with Kamala. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1989.32s)]
*  I didn't vote for Trump, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1992.9199999999998s)]
*  but I didn't look at Kamala like she was exciting, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1994.08s)]
*  because it was the same exact thing. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1995.68s)]
*  Trump is Kamala. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1996.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if this country is any different, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1997.84s)]
*  depending on who gets elected. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=1999.76s)]
*  I think that he did try. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2000.68s)]
*  That is, and again, I look at this through like, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2003.52s)]
*  was it rose colored glasses? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2006.04s)]
*  But like, I think he did try. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2008.2s)]
*  Like I think with the wars, he literally did try. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2009.04s)]
*  I think earnestly, he's talking to Putin [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2011.16s)]
*  thinking he can make it happen. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2012.84s)]
*  But I also think his hubris got the best of him. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2014.24s)]
*  Like I think he's going, yeah, I'm just gonna go over there [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2016.48s)]
*  and tell him that we're gonna do no more wars. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2018.6399999999999s)]
*  And then he realized, oh shit, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2021.56s)]
*  Putin really wants to reunite the Soviet Union. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2024.04s)]
*  That's the thing, like Trump is a business person, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2027.48s)]
*  like a business negotiator. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2029.36s)]
*  And I don't know if he anticipated the ideologues. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2030.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2033.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2034.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think Trump is like a pure ideologue. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2035.48s)]
*  Like I don't think he's like, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2036.36s)]
*  we need to make a Christian nation [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2037.28s)]
*  because that is what matters. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2038.56s)]
*  I think he's just like a business guy. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2039.56s)]
*  And then he's dealing with someone like Putin [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2040.84s)]
*  that is ostensibly a pure ideologue, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2042.08s)]
*  or like the Ayatollah that is ideological [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2044.28s)]
*  in all of their politics. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2046.28s)]
*  And then when he gets into that position, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2047.72s)]
*  he's like, well, what leverage do I have? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2049.04s)]
*  These people are willing to die for their country. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2050.2799999999997s)]
*  They're willing to like, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2051.7599999999998s)]
*  they're willing to do anything to further their agenda. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2052.6s)]
*  Like there's no reason that can be had [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2055.84s)]
*  because it's purely ideological and not fiscal. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2058.12s)]
*  He can't meet them at an economic breaking point. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2060.2s)]
*  When you're a businessman, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  you can find something the other team wants, right? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2065.28s)]
*  He can with Bibi. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2067.96s)]
*  Say again? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2069.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2069.92s)]
*  He can, he can absolutely do that with Bibi. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2070.76s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2072.0800000000004s)]
*  Because again, if he's sort of in the right wing [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2073.0400000000004s)]
*  of the Israeli government that's purely ideological, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2076.84s)]
*  it's like we want to create a greater Judea. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2079.44s)]
*  You have to look into the Likud party [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2081.36s)]
*  and see what they want. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2082.92s)]
*  And then you'll understand what Mark is saying [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2083.76s)]
*  because what they want is purely ideological. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2085.7200000000003s)]
*  And the only thing that will satisfy them [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2088.48s)]
*  is executing that ideology. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2090.52s)]
*  And when you're locked to that ideology, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2093.0s)]
*  there's really no swaying. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2095.96s)]
*  Like when you bring divine intervention into things, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2096.7999999999997s)]
*  there's no negotiating with God. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2100.3599999999997s)]
*  We need Al Oxley. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2101.92s)]
*  I understand maybe not convincing Bibi [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2102.7599999999998s)]
*  to change his course, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2106.52s)]
*  but if you rely on us for defense, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2107.6s)]
*  we can stop our support. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2110.08s)]
*  We rely on bombs, rely on us for resources. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2111.3599999999997s)]
*  We can stop our support easy and be like, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2113.8399999999997s)]
*  yo, you guys better make a deal [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2116.12s)]
*  or I'm cutting off the dollars. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2117.92s)]
*  So here's the question. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2119.64s)]
*  Here's the question. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  If you really wanted to. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2122.12s)]
*  Here's the question. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2122.94s)]
*  That's what we all believed, right? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2124.0s)]
*  All of us believe that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2127.24s)]
*  We're like, why America does not support this shit [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2128.12s)]
*  that's going on here. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2130.32s)]
*  None of us do. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2131.16s)]
*  We're seeing the death and we're seeing the destruction. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2131.98s)]
*  We're like, what the fuck has happened? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2133.48s)]
*  Why do we keep supporting this? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2134.96s)]
*  Like what is going on? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2136.2s)]
*  It seems to feel at least at this point [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2137.8s)]
*  that through AIPAC or maybe through other means, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2140.68s)]
*  there's incredible influence on our politicians. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2145.88s)]
*  I mean, Ted Cruz is just tap dancing for Israel, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2148.12s)]
*  left and right. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2150.48s)]
*  I think on July 4th, he had some tweet [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2151.32s)]
*  about the Tabi mission where they got like the. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2152.6s)]
*  It was the biggest clock in the history of America. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2156.48s)]
*  Yeah, y'all voted for him. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2158.4s)]
*  I hate her. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2159.64s)]
*  Only in Texas could he be a politician. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2160.48s)]
*  Only in Texas could some Canadian guy [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2163.16s)]
*  end up being one of your senators. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2166.44s)]
*  I hate him. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2168.12s)]
*  Take that shit on the chin. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2168.96s)]
*  Talk to your people. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2169.7799999999997s)]
*  I tried, dog. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2170.62s)]
*  You're some burglar bitch running your fucking state. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2171.46s)]
*  I tried. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2173.2s)]
*  I hate this motherfucker. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2174.04s)]
*  Electricity shuts off every fucking place. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2174.88s)]
*  I'm with you, dog. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2175.72s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2176.56s)]
*  In New York, we voted for, what was the guy? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2177.38s)]
*  Santos or whatever the fucking. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2178.48s)]
*  George Santos? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2179.92s)]
*  Yeah, the biggest liar. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2180.7599999999998s)]
*  Still not. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2181.6s)]
*  That's not New York City. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2182.44s)]
*  That's still not. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2183.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2184.72s)]
*  But at least he lied, you know what I mean? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2185.56s)]
*  At least Santos was like, yo, I'm in the military. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2186.4s)]
*  What the fuck did he say? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2188.44s)]
*  Yeah, he told you all the good shit. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  Texas gotta eat Ted Cruz. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2190.52s)]
*  Y'all keep voting for this motherfucker. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2192.04s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  Ted Cruz told the truth and still got elected. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2194.12s)]
*  Embarrassing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2194.96s)]
*  It's, I mean. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2195.7999999999997s)]
*  Seeing him wear cowboy boots like it's a fucking costume. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2197.0s)]
*  Like get the fuck out of here. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2199.4s)]
*  You're like some comic who just moved to Austin [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2200.48s)]
*  and throws on cowboy boots. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2202.0s)]
*  Go fuck yourself. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2202.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Santos would never. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2203.68s)]
*  Yeah, next thing he'll be is have aluminum foil [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2204.5s)]
*  on his hat. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2206.36s)]
*  No, but like it seems like there is this. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2207.2s)]
*  And yo, they should be doing that shit. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2210.08s)]
*  Every country should be trying to. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2211.7999999999997s)]
*  Every country should find a way to make America [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2213.04s)]
*  do the shit that they want. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  Like that should be the objective of Great Britain. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2217.3199999999997s)]
*  It should be objective of all these countries. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2219.36s)]
*  But once the American people become aware of it, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2221.2s)]
*  you can't just say it's antisemitism for pointing it out. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2224.98s)]
*  There needs to be a discussion, right? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  I think we had this conversation. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2229.84s)]
*  I don't know if it was on the last pod [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2230.92s)]
*  or maybe it was on Patreon, but like [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2232.16s)]
*  if you call everything antisemitism, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2234.2799999999997s)]
*  people get quiet because they don't wanna be called [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2237.7s)]
*  antisemite, they have tons of friends that are probably [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2239.52s)]
*  Jewish, they're like I don't want them to think that. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2241.28s)]
*  They might want entertainment. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2242.6800000000003s)]
*  They might want a career. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2244.2000000000003s)]
*  Right, so they get silence. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2245.32s)]
*  And then the only people having the conversation [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2247.6s)]
*  are the lunatics on the extremes [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2249.44s)]
*  who are actual antisemites, right? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2251.02s)]
*  And they control the discourse. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2253.4s)]
*  And now Nick Fuentes is controlling the discourse, right? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2255.0s)]
*  And it's like maybe if we had this discussion right here [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2257.98s)]
*  about like the influence on American politics [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2260.1200000000003s)]
*  from a foreign nation, if we had it just with normal people [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2262.9s)]
*  that don't have any hate in their system, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2266.6200000000003s)]
*  they want something different for America, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2268.48s)]
*  maybe if we had that conversation without the fear [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2270.84s)]
*  of being called an antisemite, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2272.84s)]
*  we wouldn't be in a much less hateful place right now. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2274.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and this is not the best comparison, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2277.0800000000004s)]
*  but I think the early days of MAGA, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2279.2000000000003s)]
*  like anybody who was MAGA or voting for Trump, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2280.6400000000003s)]
*  if they spoke out that they were for Trump, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2283.94s)]
*  you recall a racist. You're a big head. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2286.84s)]
*  So they were all quiet and the only people we heard from [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2287.6800000000003s)]
*  were the extreme MAGA ones and now to everyone else, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2290.2000000000003s)]
*  it's like oh shit, they are fucking racist and extreme. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2293.28s)]
*  Exactly. And the ones in the middle, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2295.6400000000003s)]
*  it's like boom. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2296.6000000000004s)]
*  You have to let the normal people have the, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2298.76s)]
*  like when a normal parent goes, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2301.36s)]
*  why did my eight year old come back from school today [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2303.64s)]
*  and say that they're queer? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2306.0s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2307.5s)]
*  What are you teaching my six year old in school? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2308.92s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2311.16s)]
*  And then they go and ask the school [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2312.08s)]
*  and then they get called a bigot. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2313.48s)]
*  You freak out and you stop saying anything [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2315.76s)]
*  and then the only people who are having the conversation [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2318.8s)]
*  about what's happening at school are these lunatics going, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2321.08s)]
*  they want to chop off all our kids' dicks in school. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2323.12s)]
*  You have to let people ask questions. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2325.64s)]
*  That's this younger generation. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2328.04s)]
*  You got David kissing Miles for no reason. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2329.12s)]
*  He's confused, man. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2331.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2332.24s)]
*  Let people ask questions. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2333.08s)]
*  Let's bring this back to Trump. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2333.92s)]
*  APEC, let's say, okay, he finds out APEC [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2336.7999999999997s)]
*  is kind of running things with all of these politicians. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2338.96s)]
*  How are they running things? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2341.68s)]
*  Ostensibly giving them money. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2342.72s)]
*  You're Trump, you don't need their money. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2344.2799999999997s)]
*  Your whole platform for eight years has drained the swamp. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2346.44s)]
*  So you can't go against BB? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2350.24s)]
*  Like I just don't let him off the hook for this. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2351.8799999999997s)]
*  So what do they got on Trump? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2353.72s)]
*  That's a question. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2355.04s)]
*  Or- [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2356.72s)]
*  Do they have the Epstein files? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2357.56s)]
*  Or has he, or maybe even more reasonably, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2358.4s)]
*  he's just kind of run selfishly this whole time [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2361.76s)]
*  and he never really cared about our wellbeing. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2363.96s)]
*  I don't know that he did [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2365.64s)]
*  because none of the actions have shown me differently. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2367.24s)]
*  His words did. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2370.52s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2371.76s)]
*  Listen, if you're a renter, you need to know about built. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2373.04s)]
*  Okay, most of us rack up points on groceries, travel, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2376.04s)]
*  nearly everything else. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2378.84s)]
*  So why not earn on the biggest monthly expense [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2380.32s)]
*  that you likely have? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2384.32s)]
*  And that is your rent. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2386.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm about to tell you the best hack that you can [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2387.56s)]
*  in taking advantage of that. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2390.92s)]
*  Paying rent with built unlocks flexible points [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2392.92s)]
*  that can be redeemed towards hundreds of hotels, airlines, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2396.32s)]
*  a future rent payment, your next Lyft ride, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2399.0800000000004s)]
*  student loan balances, and more. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2401.88s)]
*  But here's where it gets even better. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2403.6800000000003s)]
*  Built isn't just about points. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  They're actually helping you build credit [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2407.04s)]
*  by reporting your rent payments to credit bureaus for free. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2408.48s)]
*  Think about that, that's huge. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2411.2000000000003s)]
*  If you're trying to buy a house someday [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2412.84s)]
*  or just improve your credit score, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2414.7200000000003s)]
*  having these consistent payments count towards that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2416.52s)]
*  is massive. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2419.2000000000003s)]
*  You get a foot in the game, you get a head start. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  When you're ready to buy a home, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2422.6000000000004s)]
*  you can also redeem the bill points you've been racking up [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2424.0s)]
*  toward a down payment on the home. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2426.4s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2427.8s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2428.6400000000003s)]
*  These are things you're already buying. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2429.46s)]
*  You're already gonna be paying rent. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2430.76s)]
*  Why not get points on it? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2432.1200000000003s)]
*  I mentioned that bill points can be converted [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2433.44s)]
*  to your favorite airline miles, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2434.8s)]
*  hotel points around the world. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2436.08s)]
*  And I really mean some of the biggest players in the industry, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2438.0s)]
*  United, Southwest, Hyatt, Marriott, and more. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2440.1200000000003s)]
*  Your rent can literally help you pay for your next vacation. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2442.6s)]
*  Pay your rent, you get a vacation. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2445.3199999999997s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2520.44s)]
*  I believed a lot of what he said. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2521.56s)]
*  I was excited about his appointment, RFK. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2522.8s)]
*  I was like, yo, they can fix the food. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2524.88s)]
*  He was saying this and that. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2526.48s)]
*  I was like, hey man, I think this could work out. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2527.48s)]
*  None of it has happened. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2530.56s)]
*  None of it has happened. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2532.12s)]
*  So I just don't, I don't let him off the hook [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2534.92s)]
*  for any of this. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2537.04s)]
*  I don't even want to believe like- [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2537.88s)]
*  I don't know if I agree with none of it has happened. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2539.28s)]
*  I think that like- [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2540.72s)]
*  Fair, maybe I'm being too extreme, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2542.04s)]
*  but most of it has not. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2544.04s)]
*  I think that like there are certain things [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2545.68s)]
*  that he said he wants to do and it seems like happened. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2547.84s)]
*  Like immigration, illegal immigration [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2550.04s)]
*  has pretty much stopped. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2551.96s)]
*  Like illegal border crossing has pretty much stopped. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2553.08s)]
*  And that is a massive thing that he ran on. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2554.88s)]
*  My fear of saying none of it happens. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2556.6s)]
*  No, that's fair. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2558.12s)]
*  It basically stops anybody from listening [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2558.96s)]
*  to the other very good points that you have. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2562.36s)]
*  And I think you have like really good nuance points [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2564.3199999999997s)]
*  about this that we should be holding him to the fire. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2566.24s)]
*  No, that's fair. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2568.68s)]
*  Thank you for giving me grace. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2569.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2570.8399999999997s)]
*  So what does Christians do? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2571.68s)]
*  You fucking bigot? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2573.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2574.44s)]
*  But no, it's like, you know, the immigration, absolutely. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2576.44s)]
*  He said he wants to do the tariffs. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2579.64s)]
*  Who knows what happens with the tariffs, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2580.92s)]
*  but like these are the things that he said he's doing [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2582.44s)]
*  in negotiating these different deals in the other country. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2584.44s)]
*  There are clearly things he's trying to do, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2587.52s)]
*  but I think that there are other things [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2589.36s)]
*  that like are above his level of power. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2591.0s)]
*  It feels at least right now, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2593.36s)]
*  and I could be completely wrong, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2594.7999999999997s)]
*  he just doesn't have the power to do certain things. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2595.92s)]
*  He doesn't have the power to tell Israel [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2599.16s)]
*  what the fuck that they can do in Gaza. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2600.96s)]
*  He just doesn't have the power to do it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2603.7999999999997s)]
*  It seems like they just don't have it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2605.4s)]
*  It seems like a lot of these politicians [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2606.92s)]
*  just don't have the power. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2608.0s)]
*  You're supposed to be in a position of power, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2609.04s)]
*  but your balls are tied. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2610.72s)]
*  And the way he goes about stuff, it's like fast and loose. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2612.32s)]
*  He's a great businessman, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2615.76s)]
*  so of course he knows what he's doing, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2616.96s)]
*  but sometimes he's just like, he talks. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2618.56s)]
*  He talks a good game, and then he's like, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2620.76s)]
*  I'll figure it out after. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2622.12s)]
*  And I think with the Epstein stuff, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2623.16s)]
*  he's like, yo, we're gonna give him stuff, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2624.52s)]
*  like we'll redact a bunch of shit, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2626.72s)]
*  like don't worry about it. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2628.76s)]
*  And then when they did that, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2630.12s)]
*  they ended up giving them redacted files [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2631.0s)]
*  of less information than what we already had. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2633.28s)]
*  There was more information out, they redacted it. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2635.28s)]
*  There was more public information available. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2637.68s)]
*  They redacted pieces of the publicly available information [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2639.68s)]
*  and then handed it out. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2643.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like missteps, just like with this video. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2644.08s)]
*  He thought like, oh shit, let's give him something. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2645.72s)]
*  It's like, yo, by giving us this, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2647.7999999999997s)]
*  you're making it seem even worse. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2650.08s)]
*  And you're installing our intelligence. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2652.44s)]
*  There's a great, there's a, what's it called? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2654.36s)]
*  It's like once you lie, you have to tell more lies [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2658.7599999999998s)]
*  to protect the lie, and every lie erodes the trust [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2662.24s)]
*  that we have in you. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2665.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's what it feels like is happening. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2667.12s)]
*  There is one lie, which is Epstein did not have [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2669.36s)]
*  this global blackmail ring of the elites, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2674.08s)]
*  of the intelligentsia, of the royal family, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2676.64s)]
*  who are the big businessmen. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2681.16s)]
*  He just had a blackmail ring [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2683.36s)]
*  on all these very influential people. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2685.36s)]
*  And by saying that that didn't happen, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2687.24s)]
*  you have to tell a lot of other little lies [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2688.7599999999998s)]
*  to make that lie make sense. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  And every one of them just pulls a little piece of thread [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2693.2799999999997s)]
*  away from the fabric. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2696.36s)]
*  And we're starting to see right through right now, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2697.3199999999997s)]
*  and it's just embarrassing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2698.7999999999997s)]
*  But this is good. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2701.4s)]
*  We should know how our country operates. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2703.2s)]
*  We should know. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2706.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you think you do them, do you really want to? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2707.24s)]
*  No, no, we don't want to. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2710.3999999999996s)]
*  But if we are invested in making [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2711.64s)]
*  some sort of positive change. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2714.0s)]
*  Yeah, progress. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2715.56s)]
*  We want some sort of progress. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2716.56s)]
*  I'll be honest with you, I think one of the things [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2718.7999999999997s)]
*  that was really refreshing about Mamdani [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  is him in that press conference saying, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2722.56s)]
*  I'm not going to Israel, I'm gonna stay here, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2725.0s)]
*  and I'm gonna do what is best [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2726.4799999999996s)]
*  for the people in New York City. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2728.12s)]
*  I think that was an important message. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2729.92s)]
*  People keep on calling him anti-Semitic, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2732.44s)]
*  whatever like that. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2734.16s)]
*  And I don't know what his feeling on Jews is, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2735.0s)]
*  but right now where it feels like [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2736.6s)]
*  so many politicians are bought, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2739.28s)]
*  him putting a massive spotlight on the fact that he's not [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2741.84s)]
*  and he wants you to know that, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2746.84s)]
*  I think that that was very refreshing for a lot of people. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2748.48s)]
*  It's kind of Trump-esque. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2750.8s)]
*  I mean, this was a weird comparison, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2751.64s)]
*  but it just shows that he's a doctor. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2752.76s)]
*  No, you ready? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2753.6s)]
*  You said earlier. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2754.44s)]
*  You ready? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2755.28s)]
*  It's America first. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2756.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2757.96s)]
*  Mm. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2758.7999999999997s)]
*  The only party right now that to me seems America first [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2759.64s)]
*  is the Democrat Socialist Party. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2765.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2767.2799999999997s)]
*  Bernie is America first. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2768.12s)]
*  Mamdani and all his ideas that he will not be able [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2770.92s)]
*  to execute, and I frankly think many of them [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2773.4s)]

*  and there will be government run and that won't work [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=2917.4s)]

*  because there was that feeling of like, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3053.04s)]
*  oh yeah, you go to college [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3054.84s)]
*  and it don't really get you much. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3055.88s)]
*  Like aside from just making genius music, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3058.12s)]
*  that was a thing, we were looking at that message like, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3060.08s)]
*  oh yeah, that guy's right. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3062.2s)]
*  I remember being in college being like, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3064.2s)]
*  yeah, I don't know if I don't become a doctor, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3065.84s)]
*  what am I gonna do with this? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3067.92s)]
*  Imagine you went to college, you were working at Trader Joe's. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3068.7599999999998s)]
*  Imagine you got $200,000 worth of debt, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3071.68s)]
*  you were working at Trader Joe's [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3073.56s)]
*  with a dude who graduated from high school. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3074.4s)]
*  That dude who graduated from high school [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3076.8399999999997s)]
*  has way more upper mobility than you. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3078.0s)]
*  The homeless guy asking you for money has less debt. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3079.7599999999998s)]
*  No, he doesn't. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3082.08s)]
*  He has. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3082.9199999999996s)]
*  No, you are more broke than the dudes on the street. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3083.7599999999998s)]
*  You're negative. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3087.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3088.48s)]
*  And that starts to weigh on people. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3089.3199999999997s)]
*  And then when you hear Mom Donnie talk [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3090.8599999999997s)]
*  and when you hear Bernie talk [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3092.46s)]
*  and I'm sure when you hear AOC talk, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3093.6s)]
*  it really resonates with you. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3094.96s)]
*  And college debt forgiveness seems like, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3096.04s)]
*  yo, you should forgive because you lied to me [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3097.6s)]
*  about what this degree would mean. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3099.6s)]
*  I also think we gotta hold the universities [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3100.96s)]
*  a little bit accountable. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3102.6s)]
*  I think the government actually did something good [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3103.9199999999996s)]
*  and benevolent. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3107.04s)]
*  I think they said, we want our populace to be educated [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3107.88s)]
*  and we're gonna back these loans no matter what. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3109.92s)]
*  They didn't put a limit. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3111.84s)]
*  And then these fucking grimy colleges were like, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3113.0s)]
*  oh, they're gonna back it no matter what? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3115.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3116.52s)]
*  That tuition's going up. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3117.36s)]
*  Running it up. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3118.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3119.04s)]
*  That's some sinister shit. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3119.88s)]
*  We should see who is in control [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3120.96s)]
*  of these educational institutions [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3122.8s)]
*  and who made the decision to ramp up those fucking prices [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3124.4s)]
*  because they knew that there was an endless bank account [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3127.6400000000003s)]
*  that was gonna pay for it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3129.52s)]
*  And saddled these kids with debt. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3130.8s)]
*  Now, ultimately, we're responsible for taking on that debt. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3132.1800000000003s)]
*  We have agency, but there are some people [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3134.8s)]
*  that are pretty nefarious at these institutions. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3137.6800000000003s)]
*  Just people, just every institution. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3140.0400000000004s)]
*  Once that becomes the norm. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3141.8s)]
*  It's like a systemic issue, right? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3143.8s)]
*  It's just like we exist in a consumer culture. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3145.4s)]
*  Yeah, the rate of inflation, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3147.5200000000004s)]
*  I remember, I think my college was expensive [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3148.5200000000004s)]
*  when I graduated. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3150.5200000000004s)]
*  It was 25K a year, expensive. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3151.36s)]
*  And then I went back four or five years later, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3152.84s)]
*  it was 45K a year. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3154.76s)]
*  That rate of inflation is crazy. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3156.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3158.44s)]
*  What were you saying, systemic issue, though? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3159.28s)]
*  It's just like, this is American society at large [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3160.84s)]
*  since the 80s. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3163.28s)]
*  We just consume. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3164.12s)]
*  That is just the nature of life. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3165.44s)]
*  We are consumption machines, we wanna buy things, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3167.56s)]
*  we're designed to buy things. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3169.72s)]
*  We're prompted with things that are more distilled, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3171.16s)]
*  more tasty, more appetizing [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3174.3599999999997s)]
*  that just drive us to buy more and more and more consistently. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3176.6s)]
*  Our phones break, we buy more. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3179.8399999999997s)]
*  It's just built that way. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3181.3199999999997s)]
*  And then we don't really produce as much. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3182.4s)]
*  Post-World War II, it's like, we're making shit, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3184.52s)]
*  you have jobs, da-da-da. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3186.3199999999997s)]
*  But now it's like, okay, low prices. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3187.44s)]
*  Just cater to the consumer. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3188.7999999999997s)]
*  And it just ripples through everything, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3190.16s)]
*  whether it's healthcare, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3191.68s)]
*  where prices go crazy and then insurance backs it, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3192.88s)]
*  whether it's college loans, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3195.96s)]
*  whether it's the housing crisis. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3197.52s)]
*  It's just all like, yeah, just continue to consume [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3198.84s)]
*  because that is ultimately what grows our GDP the most. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3201.08s)]
*  It grows our GDP, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3203.28s)]
*  but it doesn't allow that upward mobility that we want. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3204.36s)]
*  And what it does is really extend this age of adolescence. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3206.8s)]
*  The 40-year-old in New York, as I sit here with pants [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3210.4s)]
*  that barely come below my knees, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3213.32s)]
*  I've been fortunate enough to make some money [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3214.92s)]
*  and get married and start a family. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3216.48s)]
*  But the 40-year-old in New York has the flat screen, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3218.08s)]
*  has the nice phone, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3220.44s)]
*  has the cool accoutrements in their apartment, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3221.84s)]
*  but still rents his apartment. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3225.08s)]
*  It might not be married, doesn't have a family. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3226.44s)]
*  And I think that that's where things start to weigh on them. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3229.12s)]
*  They go, when will I have a family? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3232.16s)]
*  When will I make enough? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3234.08s)]
*  If I'm kinda living paycheck to paycheck, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3235.16s)]
*  I get to take a little vacation. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3237.08s)]
*  I get to go to Montauk with my friends for a week [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3238.96s)]
*  and it's fun, but I don't really have a plan for a future. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3242.12s)]
*  I don't really have a plan for adulthood. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3246.36s)]
*  I forget which economist said this. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3248.8s)]
*  This is someone from back in college. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3250.6400000000003s)]
*  But he basically said, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3251.88s)]
*  consumerist culture is the perfect form of slavery. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3252.8s)]
*  Because it's slavery with no rebellion. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3257.1600000000003s)]
*  Because you have all your shit, you know what I mean? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3259.2000000000003s)]
*  Prices are low. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3260.92s)]
*  I can't be a press mark. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3261.76s)]
*  I got a Nintendo Switch too. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  Exactly, and life is good and our standard of living [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3263.8s)]
*  is so much higher than the rest of the world, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3266.04s)]
*  but you can't actually own anything [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3267.2400000000002s)]
*  and then the wealth gap increases. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3269.44s)]
*  And so it's like, yeah, I have no reason to rebel, right? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3271.84s)]
*  We have all the shit we need. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3274.44s)]
*  We have food, dah, dah, dah, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3275.36s)]
*  even though it's kinda bad for you. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3276.2400000000002s)]
*  And we have healthcare, even though it's expensive. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3277.2400000000002s)]
*  And we have education, even though you can't afford it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3278.56s)]
*  The consumerist thing feels dirtier [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3279.72s)]
*  when it's healthcare or education. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  Or like, you convincing me I need an iPhone, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3282.92s)]
*  I buy an iPhone, that's on me. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3285.68s)]
*  You convincing me my life will be better. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3286.92s)]
*  Education feels like you convinced me I cannot have a life. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3288.56s)]
*  Which I guess is all marketing, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3292.4s)]
*  but it feels grimier with education and healthcare. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3294.08s)]
*  Like education is a fundamental need for me [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3296.0s)]
*  as a human being. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3298.6s)]
*  Yeah, for democracy to exist. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3299.42s)]
*  And healthcare is inherently inelastic. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3300.44s)]
*  You need that. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3302.16s)]
*  And the rate of inflation being what it is, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3303.16s)]
*  it feels dirtier than iPhone prices. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3305.12s)]
*  You know what we should have done with education, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3308.64s)]
*  and maybe we should just do it right now? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3310.3199999999997s)]
*  Charge different amounts for different degrees. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3312.04s)]
*  If you're getting a poetry degree, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3315.16s)]
*  the cost of the education for a poetry major [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3317.24s)]
*  is far less than the education for a bio major. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3320.36s)]
*  They should give you money. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3323.64s)]
*  You should be paid to be able to. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3324.72s)]
*  You go for the poetry degree, they're like, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3325.56s)]
*  here's 10 grand. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3327.2s)]
*  Yeah, like you should just have a cheaper way [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3328.04s)]
*  to get that education. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3330.0s)]
*  Because one, then you're not gonna be saddled with debt. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3330.88s)]
*  If you wanna study poetry and then go be a poet, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3332.68s)]
*  at least you don't have $200,000 worth of debt. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3335.44s)]
*  Maybe you got 40 grand worth of debt at the end, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3336.6800000000003s)]
*  and you could sustain that while you work in a cafe, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3338.76s)]
*  you're a barista, and you're working on your art, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3341.0800000000004s)]
*  and hopefully you make that into something. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3343.4s)]
*  But if you spend $200,000 on an engineering education, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3345.38s)]
*  you probably will get a job that will allow you [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3350.2000000000003s)]
*  to one day pay that off. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3352.2000000000003s)]
*  You will not get that as a poetry major. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3353.96s)]
*  Of course, but again, that is just like inherently [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3355.6400000000003s)]
*  antithetical to the system. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3358.0800000000004s)]
*  Here's the other, so just like make more money. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3359.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3361.32s)]
*  Like if we have 100 kids that are all willing [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3362.1600000000003s)]
*  to spend 50K a year, like why would we reduce half of them? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3363.64s)]
*  I looked into this a little bit. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3368.72s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3370.48s)]
*  But apparently, all these liberal arts degrees [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3371.7599999999998s)]
*  are subsidizing the science degrees. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3375.72s)]
*  So in other words, it costs far more to educate, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3378.4s)]
*  like you did bio in school. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3381.12s)]
*  Like it costs far more to educate you [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3382.4s)]
*  than somebody who's a history major. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3384.16s)]
*  So those history majors are essentially paying [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3386.04s)]
*  to keep your level of education down. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3388.68s)]
*  Which I guess is beneficial to those science majors. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3391.54s)]
*  And maybe if it was too expensive for science majors, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3396.1s)]
*  maybe a lot of them wouldn't do it. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3398.56s)]
*  And we do want more science and engineering majors. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3399.66s)]
*  But at the same time, don't make these people [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3402.38s)]
*  that don't have interest in that be saddled with this debt [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3405.7s)]
*  that will be so crippling that they'll just be like, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3407.7799999999997s)]
*  of course. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3409.7s)]
*  Here's where AI is changing everything. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3410.54s)]
*  And we had an awesome conversation with Fareed [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3411.7799999999997s)]
*  just to tease a little bit, but he brought this up. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3413.94s)]
*  Computer science majors, Fareed Zakaria from CNN, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3415.74s)]
*  computer science majors out of college [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3418.2599999999998s)]
*  have a higher unemployment rate [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3420.24s)]
*  than art history majors right now. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3421.3199999999997s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3422.64s)]
*  Obviously, advancement of technology will change these things. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3423.4799999999996s)]
*  But if you went back like 10 years or something like that, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3425.2799999999997s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3427.7599999999998s)]
*  You'd see this. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3428.6s)]
*  If we can do this 20, 30 years ago, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3429.4399999999996s)]
*  yes, that's what it should be. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3430.8799999999997s)]
*  Like you had a pathway, like if you wanted, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3431.9599999999996s)]
*  you're a smart guy, you had a pathway [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3434.4399999999996s)]
*  to becoming a doctor if you wanted. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3436.3199999999997s)]
*  And you chose not to do that, that's your choice. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3438.3199999999997s)]
*  But there was a pathway for you. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3440.68s)]
*  And- [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3442.3599999999997s)]
*  There's a pathway to being rich. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3443.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3444.68s)]
*  And if you're a poetry major, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3445.5s)]
*  not really a pathway to being rich. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3446.4399999999996s)]
*  And that's okay, you should be allowed to study that. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3447.92s)]
*  Do what you love. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3450.7200000000003s)]
*  And do what you love, but- [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3451.56s)]
*  You shouldn't be saddled with the same debt [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3452.92s)]
*  as someone who goes on to be a doctor. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3454.2000000000003s)]
*  You shouldn't have to pay for someone's education [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3455.7200000000003s)]
*  because you don't wanna be a scientist. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3458.96s)]
*  No, that's valid, it's very valid. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3461.76s)]
*  I don't know, I think that we have to completely look [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3463.38s)]
*  at the college education system differently. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3465.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe not advanced education, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3468.32s)]
*  maybe when you're getting like a business degree, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3469.88s)]
*  which is like kind of bullshit if you ask me. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3472.16s)]
*  Like my wife got her MBA, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3474.4s)]
*  I think a lot of it was- [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3476.2s)]
*  Networking. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3478.16s)]
*  Networking. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3479.82s)]
*  It's not even like things that she was, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3480.66s)]
*  I don't wanna say she didn't learn anything there. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3483.28s)]
*  Of course she like learned things, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  but like the most valuable things was rubbing shoulders [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3485.8s)]
*  with these kids who were like a senator's kid [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3488.36s)]
*  or a hedge fund manager's kid, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3490.88s)]
*  like building up your Rolodex. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3492.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3494.36s)]
*  So yeah, I think we gotta change the way [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3495.2s)]
*  that at least Americans look at advanced education. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3498.28s)]
*  I think one potential fix could be the same way we do [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3501.44s)]
*  all education before college, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3506.8s)]
*  is just have public and private. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3508.32s)]
*  So all public universities should just be free. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3510.36s)]
*  So everyone has access to college [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3513.36s)]
*  and doesn't have to come out with gripling debt. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3515.44s)]
*  And then, hey, if you wanna go to one of the better schools, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3517.7200000000003s)]
*  you gotta pay for it. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3520.0s)]
*  And so that way it's like, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3521.4s)]
*  everyone has the opportunity to be educated, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3522.7200000000003s)]
*  to get the degree, to get in the workforce. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3524.9s)]
*  But you know, some people with more means [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3527.36s)]
*  are able to go to different schools. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3529.28s)]
*  And I think they should do the same thing with healthcare. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3530.98s)]
*  All healthcare should be free. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3535.0s)]
*  But hey, you have the free doctors. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3536.46s)]
*  This is what keeps you alive. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3539.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3541.28s)]
*  The bare minimum to keep you alive is- [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3542.12s)]
*  And if you wanna pay for private insurance [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3543.84s)]
*  just so you can see some of the better doctors, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3546.0s)]
*  hey, if you have the means to do it, you should do it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3547.56s)]
*  Like that should be across the board. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  Here's my question, how do you pay, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3551.36s)]
*  because it's more expensive to have a college than- [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3553.12s)]
*  Stop fighting wars for everybody. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3555.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3556.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3557.6s)]
*  It's like- [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3558.44s)]
*  How do you do it right now with elementary school, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3559.28s)]
*  with high school, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3560.8s)]
*  like your tax dollars can do it? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3561.64s)]
*  Can you not blame Americans for being frustrated [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3562.8s)]
*  when America is spending billions of dollars [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3566.48s)]
*  to fight wars for other countries [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3569.84s)]
*  that have free healthcare and free college? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3572.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3575.1600000000003s)]
*  Like it seems to me that those countries, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3576.0s)]
*  that they do care about their sovereignty [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3579.8s)]
*  more than anything in the world, as they should, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3582.0s)]
*  that they should first be sacrificing those programs [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3584.32s)]
*  to pay for their sovereignty- [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3588.5600000000004s)]
*  As the opposite. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3590.2000000000003s)]
*  Americans are, yeah. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3591.08s)]
*  Am I crazy to say that? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3593.2s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3594.52s)]
*  No, again, it's like just the idea, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3595.36s)]
*  like do you want to sort of come off [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3596.84s)]
*  of the geopolitical positions? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3599.36s)]
*  Which again, I'm not like a forever wars guy. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3600.8s)]
*  I don't think we should be like supporting [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3602.7599999999998s)]
*  all these conflicts. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3603.8s)]
*  I don't wanna come off of per se, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3604.64s)]
*  but I want a conversation which is like, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3606.92s)]
*  hey, you are fighting for your survival. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3608.52s)]
*  How much does that survival matter to you? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3611.8s)]
*  Yeah, the most. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3613.68s)]
*  It matters the most? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3614.52s)]
*  Well, then you're gonna have to take your free healthcare [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3615.36s)]
*  and your college education budget [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3618.92s)]
*  that you've allocated for your people, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3621.16s)]
*  and you're gonna have to put that [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3623.6s)]
*  into your safety and security. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3624.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that that is a crazy thing [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3626.44s)]
*  to ask other countries if we're gonna send them [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3628.2000000000003s)]
*  billions of dollars worth of bombs. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3630.6800000000003s)]
*  Even if it chips away one billion, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3632.52s)]
*  it's a statement that our support is appreciated [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3635.04s)]
*  and not entitled. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3639.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3641.04s)]
*  I wanna have great relationships with other countries, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3641.88s)]
*  but I don't want it to have it at the sacrifice [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3644.0s)]
*  of our citizens. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3646.36s)]
*  Our citizens should be taken care of first, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3647.88s)]
*  and then if there is spillover after that, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3649.88s)]
*  we should exert that power. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3652.08s)]
*  But if you're telling, not you're telling me, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3653.4s)]
*  but if somebody's telling me like, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3655.28s)]
*  we need to have this influence in the world, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3656.7200000000003s)]
*  maybe we can't afford it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3659.2000000000003s)]
*  I would love us to have this influence in the world, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3661.0s)]
*  not at the sacrifice of our citizens. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3663.08s)]
*  And not that I agree with either war, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3666.44s)]
*  I'm against all war, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3668.28s)]
*  but I feel like in the early stages of Ukraine, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3669.2000000000003s)]
*  when they raised the age limit for their citizens to fight, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3672.84s)]
*  and I was like, all right, you know what, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3677.36s)]
*  you're sacrificing, I feel a little bit somewhat okay. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3678.7200000000003s)]
*  Raise the age or lower the age? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3683.1600000000003s)]
*  They raised the age for people to fight. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3684.76s)]
*  On the top end, you can feed, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3686.6800000000003s)]
*  whereas 40 you're out of war. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3688.44s)]
*  I thought you meant like, instead of 18, 21. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3689.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3691.4s)]
*  You mean like 50. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3692.2400000000002s)]
*  The top, yeah. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3693.06s)]
*  There should be no age. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3693.9s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3694.96s)]
*  Do you wanna survive as a country or not? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3695.8s)]
*  Everybody gotta fight. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3698.44s)]
*  Drive your rascal right over there. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3699.8s)]
*  We were playing baseball in America. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3701.0800000000004s)]
*  We did everything we could to keep this country afloat. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3703.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, fuckin' Rosie O'Donnell. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3708.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3709.6400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I was like, all right, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3710.7200000000003s)]
*  you're at least doing everything you possibly could, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3712.36s)]
*  and now we're offering some monetary. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3715.2400000000002s)]
*  We made women get jobs. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3717.76s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3719.0800000000004s)]
*  Factories. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3719.92s)]
*  I know, still paying for it. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3720.7400000000002s)]
*  I honestly. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3721.7200000000003s)]
*  But I don't think that that's like. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3723.28s)]
*  To death that never ends. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3724.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that's an unfair statement, right? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3725.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, how important is your survival? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3727.2400000000002s)]
*  How important is your sovereignty? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3728.96s)]
*  How important is it to you? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3730.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, it is the utmost importance? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3732.2400000000002s)]
*  Nothing is more important than that? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3735.88s)]
*  Okay, well you're gonna have to sacrifice [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3737.62s)]
*  a little bit at home for that. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3738.54s)]
*  Just like we had to. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3739.9s)]
*  We turned our entire country [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3740.82s)]
*  into a military industrial complex during World War II. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3742.42s)]
*  Ford stopped making Fords, and they started making tanks. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3745.94s)]
*  That's what we do when it's time to bang. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3750.18s)]
*  We changed time. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3751.9s)]
*  That's where daylight savings came from. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3752.7400000000002s)]
*  We pushed the clocks forward an hour, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3753.56s)]
*  so there's an extra hour of sunlight, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3754.82s)]
*  so you didn't lose electricity. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3756.38s)]
*  I think they kept it going for other reasons. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3757.7s)]
*  But that's how it started. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3759.26s)]
*  Just everybody, hey, time is different now. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3760.38s)]
*  That's it. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3763.18s)]
*  You're all an hour ahead. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3764.0s)]
*  We need more electricity or save money. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3765.54s)]
*  That's a commitment to sovereignty. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3767.66s)]
*  While I do wanna help our allies, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3769.38s)]
*  and I do think it is important [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3771.62s)]
*  to have good relationships with our allies. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3773.02s)]
*  I do think that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3774.84s)]
*  We need to also understand that they value our support, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3776.18s)]
*  and it's not something that they just feel [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3779.82s)]
*  like they can call and ask for at any point in time [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3781.26s)]
*  while not sacrificing anything at home. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3782.94s)]
*  You gotta pay for some shit, yo. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3784.7s)]
*  Yep. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3787.06s)]
*  1000%. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3788.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3789.22s)]
*  I guess I'd be curious to know the internal negotiation [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3790.14s)]
*  where it's like, yo, we're gonna help you out [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3791.98s)]
*  with this thing, we're gonna buy your weapons, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3793.26s)]
*  and a billion dollars to you is not that much. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3795.1000000000004s)]
*  That's like a quarter of our GDP. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3797.42s)]
*  I hear that about Ukraine. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3798.5s)]
*  You, I think, said that where it's like, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3799.6600000000003s)]
*  a lot of that money ends up coming back to America. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3801.1000000000004s)]
*  90% of it is going to the military industrial complex here. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3802.94s)]
*  So they're like, why would we sacrifice our citizens' life [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3804.6200000000003s)]
*  that's already being crushed by a foreign government [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3806.84s)]
*  or by a foreign military when we're pumping all this money [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3809.6200000000003s)]
*  back into your economy and making you people rich? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3812.34s)]
*  We're just asking for favorable deals on weapons, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3813.82s)]
*  da da da da. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3816.82s)]
*  Yeah, somebody gotta make the weapons. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3817.6600000000003s)]
*  Weapons are free. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3818.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3819.42s)]
*  So it's not like, are we charging them triple [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3820.26s)]
*  for the weapons? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3824.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3825.06s)]
*  We're probably charging you the going rate for weapons. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3825.8799999999997s)]
*  We're not charging you a VIG on it. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3827.74s)]
*  We're not charging you this crazy tariff. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3829.3799999999997s)]
*  We're not doing like a rock where we like blow something up [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3831.02s)]
*  and build it up for 20 times the price. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3833.2599999999998s)]

*  That's what we're doing. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3837.3399999999997s)]
*  We can look into it and see, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3838.18s)]
*  but I doubt that that's what we're doing. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3839.2599999999998s)]
*  That would be pretty egregious. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3840.8199999999997s)]

*  They've maintained power for a reason [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3886.66s)]
*  and they wanna maintain that power. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3888.54s)]
*  And Trump needs to know that going into these things. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3890.22s)]
*  Like he could be played at every point [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3892.54s)]

*  he should get some kind of honor [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3946.98s)]

*  I couldn't believe what a terrible person she is. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3962.62s)]
*  Every time we try to believe women, it backfires. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3964.7s)]
*  I know, I know, we should've learned better. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3966.98s)]
*  Did he get charged for that abuse? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3970.9s)]

*  Was that drunk? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3974.34s)]
*  No, because he didn't do anything wrong. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3975.16s)]
*  That's right. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3976.18s)]

*  Put up on those charges. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3980.34s)]
*  So they paid off the guy at the hotel or whatever [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3981.62s)]
*  to get the video and then somehow [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3984.18s)]
*  the video gets leaked later on. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3986.2999999999997s)]

*  What a scumbag at that hotel. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3989.18s)]
*  In LA, I think you only have a year [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3990.02s)]
*  to file for domestic violence. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3992.74s)]

*  That's crazy. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3995.82s)]
*  Can I just tell you? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3996.66s)]
*  LA is. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3997.5s)]
*  I'm not saying there shouldn't be statute of limitations [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=3998.5s)]
*  but a year is wild. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4000.54s)]
*  What's up? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4001.38s)]

*  or California has the strictest divorce laws in the country. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4005.58s)]

*  If you guys just live together for 10 years, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4011.46s)]
*  there's like a common law arrangement [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4013.78s)]
*  where they're entitled to half. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4015.58s)]
*  Yikes. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4017.06s)]
*  Yeah, you could beat her [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4017.9s)]
*  and as long as she's unconscious for a year, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4018.98s)]
*  she can't do anything about it. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4020.82s)]
*  You shit. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4023.14s)]
*  If you beat a woman until she's in a coma [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4024.3399999999997s)]

*  Yeah, that kind of makes a bad sense [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4055.56s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4077.2s)]

*  Not like illegal young, but like 19, 18. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4087.0s)]
*  Like you get somebody over there, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4089.16s)]
*  you can hostage him up and pretty much believe in anything [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4090.92s)]

*  Oh yeah, you idiot. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4106.66s)]
*  Of course. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4107.5s)]
*  Why else do you think he's paying your rent? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4108.64s)]
*  Have you guys watched a movie together? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4110.8s)]

*  Like that's your job. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4116.240000000001s)]
*  Your job is to get jerked off on and then you get a house. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4117.4400000000005s)]

*  oh, we're gonna be together [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4127.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4133.120000000001s)]
*  Like we gotta call that something else. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4133.9400000000005s)]

*  We have to stop talking about [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4144.84s)]
*  the geopolitical controversies in the world [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4148.0s)]
*  for just one moment because obviously Wimbledon [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4149.9800000000005s)]
*  is happening, obviously people are engaged, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4152.72s)]
*  obviously people are excited. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4155.240000000001s)]
*  You right here, you think Novak Djokovic is gonna win it. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4157.160000000001s)]
*  I think this is his last shot to win it. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4161.72s)]
*  It's not his last. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4163.4800000000005s)]
*  He's gonna grand slam. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4164.320000000001s)]
*  I think this is his last best shot. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4165.160000000001s)]
*  I think that guy Janek Sinner, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4166.68s)]
*  the number one player in the world is hurt. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4168.360000000001s)]
*  The number three player was out, Sasha Zverev. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4169.96s)]
*  And I think Alcaraes is really good, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4173.88s)]
*  but this is Novak's best surface. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4176.200000000001s)]
*  And this is his last. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4177.88s)]
*  He's getting older. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4178.84s)]
*  These young guys are so good. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4179.660000000001s)]
*  I just think they're better than. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4181.08s)]
*  Alcaraes won this the last two years in a row. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4182.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4185.160000000001s)]
*  This is his last shot. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4186.4400000000005s)]
*  After this, I don't think it happens for Novak. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4187.660000000001s)]
*  I think Sinner is out. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4190.08s)]
*  I think that hurt a lot. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4191.06s)]
*  Zverev losing hurts a lot. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4192.12s)]
*  All the guys that can outgun him for sure [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4193.46s)]
*  are out except Alcaraes. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4195.88s)]
*  And Alcaraes still could well be. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4196.96s)]
*  So you're putting your money on Joe Kovacs? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4198.36s)]
*  Eh, I don't know if I put my money on Alcaraes. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4200.36s)]
*  I might still put my money on Alcaraes, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4203.88s)]
*  but this is the last. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4205.52s)]
*  This is his best shot to win before he retires, I think. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4206.96s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4209.4800000000005s)]
*  One more. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4210.32s)]
*  Alex Media, where would you put your money on? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4211.16s)]
*  Alcaraes. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4214.0s)]
*  100% Alcaraes. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4214.92s)]
*  Okay, so Alcaraes is gonna take it. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4216.28s)]
*  Stake is where you're gonna go put your money down. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4217.8s)]

*  Maybe we're wildin' right now, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4227.8s)]

*  I just want the name to change, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4231.24s)]

*  Don't call it a good thing. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4236.08s)]
*  Love is good. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4237.32s)]
*  Bomb is bad. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4238.16s)]
*  No, bomb is bad, but it's not, what's that? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4239.32s)]
*  Sometimes it's good. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4242.04s)]
*  Sometimes it's good, yeah. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4242.88s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4247.639999999999s)]
*  You grow from bombing. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4248.48s)]
*  No, but it's not love. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4250.5599999999995s)]
*  The reason it's manipulative is because it's not actual love. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4254.28s)]
*  These aren't real feelings you have for somebody. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4258.5599999999995s)]
*  You're lying to them. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4260.4s)]
*  Lie bombing, call it lie bombing, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4261.92s)]

*  Yeah, love bombing does sound nice. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4274.48s)]

*  And then you find out it's bad. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4286.08s)]
*  Poetry education, bro. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4287.6s)]

*  and you're like, that sounds pretty good. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4293.84s)]
*  And then you find out it's actually terrible. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4294.84s)]
*  You're like, oh fuck, gaslighting sounds bad. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4296.0s)]
*  Gaslighting sounds bad. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4297.92s)]
*  If you called it what it is, which is just lying, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4299.12s)]

*  ooh, that's a really good phrase. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4305.2s)]
*  But I think girls call love bombing this thing [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4307.0s)]
*  and it's just like, hold on, being nice to you, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4310.16s)]
*  the communication's off, being nice to you is wrong. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4313.4800000000005s)]

*  What about the trips and stuff? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4317.96s)]
*  That's not lying, you're actually doing those things. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4319.88s)]

*  Yes. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4445.120000000001s)]
*  Has love bombing ever worked on a dude? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4445.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4448.400000000001s)]

*  and you got some dick out of me. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4453.4400000000005s)]
*  Every colt does this. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4454.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4456.04s)]
*  You got some dude, he's like, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4456.88s)]
*  doesn't have a ton of friends, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4457.88s)]
*  we're your best friends, we love you. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4459.64s)]
*  No, no, we're talking sexually here. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4460.76s)]
*  I don't want you, don't take it to fucking platonic places. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4462.320000000001s)]
*  But the love bombing is rarely sexually. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4464.280000000001s)]
*  But let's talk about, you know what? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4465.6s)]
*  Let's talk about. No, sexual relationships. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4466.92s)]
*  Let's talk about the colt [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4468.08s)]
*  because I think what you're not putting enough weight on [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4469.04s)]
*  is the state that that human being is in. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4472.56s)]
*  Is he susceptible to this love bomb [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4477.6s)]
*  or is she susceptible to this love bomb? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4479.4800000000005s)]
*  I would say this is the same case with a relationship. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4481.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they would say they're preying on these people. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4482.8s)]
*  So that person is prey. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4484.84s)]
*  That person is going through something horrible [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4486.6s)]
*  in their life where they're susceptible. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4488.32s)]
*  It's like a hypnotism. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4489.639999999999s)]
*  Not everybody can be hypnotized. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4490.88s)]
*  Right, they had a trauma in their past. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4492.44s)]
*  They had an abusive parent. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4494.24s)]
*  Now they seek that kind of same familiar love [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4495.48s)]
*  in their romantic relationship. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4497.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so that's about what they went through in their life. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4498.92s)]
*  It's not about the actions of kindness and love. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4500.679999999999s)]
*  You should be kind and loving to somebody. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4502.719999999999s)]
*  That is a great thing that we should do. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4504.5199999999995s)]
*  What does Christianity preach? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4505.92s)]
*  Exactly, but what if you say, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4507.16s)]
*  hey, let's go on a trip, let's go on my boat. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4508.599999999999s)]
*  And so- Yo, should Christianity stop loving? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4510.12s)]
*  No, because they don't do the bad part. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4513.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4514.84s)]
*  What do you mean they don't do the bad part? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4515.679999999999s)]
*  Why are you not connecting this? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4516.5199999999995s)]
*  Because they're not like, oh, if you leave the church, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4519.16s)]
*  like we're gonna cut you off from your family. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4521.36s)]
*  Wait, come on. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4523.639999999999s)]
*  Keep going on that. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4524.48s)]
*  What, that's true. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4525.719999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, hold on, keep going on that. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4526.5599999999995s)]
*  If you leave the Catholic church, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4528.0s)]
*  you're allowed to leave freely. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4529.08s)]
*  If you leave like a Presbyterian church, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4530.719999999999s)]
*  you can leave freely. Yeah, you just go to hell [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4531.92s)]
*  for the rest of your life. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4532.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's free. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4534.16s)]
*  That seems pretty free. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4535.0s)]
*  Because you can keep your relationship with Jesus. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4535.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4537.44s)]
*  And then even then, you have purgatory, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4538.48s)]
*  you then can get into heaven after. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4539.8s)]
*  I think that what we would also, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4540.639999999999s)]
*  this is not an indictment crusading, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4541.84s)]
*  but I think that there are definitely situations [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4543.12s)]
*  where leaving the church means leaving your community. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4545.04s)]
*  People characterize as cults. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4548.24s)]
*  As cults. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4549.5199999999995s)]
*  So you're saying that Christianity [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4550.36s)]
*  is not living up to its ideals in that circumstance. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4551.719999999999s)]
*  Right, yeah, I would consider that cultish. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4554.48s)]
*  That's fair, that's fair. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4556.44s)]
*  I mean, if you're part of like a hyper-religious sect [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4557.28s)]
*  and you leave and they're like knocking on your door, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4558.84s)]
*  like come back or we're gonna fucking keep your kids, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4560.28s)]
*  you can't talk to them. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4562.08s)]
*  Then it's like a cult. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4562.92s)]
*  Yeah, okay, that's fair, that's fair. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4563.76s)]
*  And so like with these girls, like hypothetically, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4564.96s)]
*  I don't know, a guy says, hey, let's go on a trip, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4566.88s)]
*  let's go on my boat. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4568.8s)]
*  And she's like, yeah, that sounds great, awesome. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4569.639999999999s)]
*  And then he starts being a piece of shit to her. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4570.92s)]
*  Like you can't leave, you can't talk to him, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4572.44s)]
*  give him your phone, let me see your phone. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4573.879999999999s)]
*  That's the bad part. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4575.28s)]
*  But, and then she says no, he goes fine, the trip's off, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4576.4s)]
*  we're not going anywhere. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4579.44s)]
*  That's the bad part. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4580.719999999999s)]
*  And then she says fine, you can take it, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4581.839999999999s)]
*  and he goes, okay, check. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4582.879999999999s)]
*  Why are we vilifying the first part? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4583.719999999999s)]
*  It's conditional. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4585.5599999999995s)]
*  But it doesn't add a condition built in. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4586.839999999999s)]
*  Why don't you like to add a condition? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4588.5599999999995s)]
*  Life is conditions. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4590.5199999999995s)]
*  Our wives love us, we start fucking every bitch [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4592.799999999999s)]
*  on the street, that love goes away. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4594.759999999999s)]
*  Isn't it conditional to love? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4596.04s)]
*  Exactly, you're right. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4597.5599999999995s)]
*  All love is conditional except for your parents [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4598.719999999999s)]
*  if they're good parents. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4600.839999999999s)]
*  But we agree that some- [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4601.72s)]
*  I can't be critical of anything my wife does ever. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4602.56s)]
*  I just gotta tell her how it makes me feel. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4604.76s)]
*  That seems conditional. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4606.8s)]
*  That seems very conditional. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4609.360000000001s)]
*  Why are we acting like there's not conditions [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4610.400000000001s)]
*  for human relationships? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4611.92s)]
*  No, there are conditions. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4612.88s)]
*  There are conditions, but we agree as a society [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4613.92s)]
*  that some conditions might broach too far. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4615.56s)]
*  How about this, this is in the Constitution. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4617.72s)]
*  You go on a guy's boat, he's gonna use your throat. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4619.56s)]
*  Just know that. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4624.12s)]
*  I have a daughter, I will be telling my daughter that. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4625.08s)]

*  You go on a guy's boat, he's gonna use your throat. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4629.28s)]
*  And if he doesn't get to use your throat, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4632.5199999999995s)]
*  you're not going on the boat again. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4634.0s)]
*  Those are the rules for boats. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4635.44s)]
*  That is poetry. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4636.84s)]

*  We gotta stop- [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4642.76s)]
*  I pledge allegiance to this boat. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4643.599999999999s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4650.599999999999s)]

*  ladies, you have to be aware of what a guy wants. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4657.32s)]

*  It happens far less often than- [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4685.24s)]
*  It's also the same- [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4687.599999999999s)]
*  A broke guy love bombing is texting all the time, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4688.44s)]

*  of it to pussy smell. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4707.04s)]

*  It could be a lack of sexual chemistry, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4731.68s)]
*  which is very important. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4734.96s)]

*  Listen, obviously I'm taking like a wild approach to this [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4787.88s)]
*  on the other side. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4791.16s)]
*  We don't. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4792.16s)]
*  But like, I do be getting confused [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4793.0s)]
*  when people talk about love bombing. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4793.84s)]
*  No, can we talk about it? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4795.28s)]
*  When people talk about love bombing, I get confused. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4796.12s)]
*  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but I get confused. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4798.12s)]
*  I just don't exactly understand. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4800.68s)]
*  Ed Cruz is love bombing Israel every single day. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4802.0s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4804.52s)]
*  Every day he is love bombing. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4805.36s)]
*  I think it'd be the opposite, actually. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4807.28s)]
*  And Israel is hate bombing Palestine. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4808.36s)]
*  Well. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4810.76s)]
*  For no fucking reason. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4811.6s)]
*  Well, they got a reason. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4817.08s)]
*  I think they had a reason. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4818.4s)]
*  The question is, how much longer is this gonna go on? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4821.16s)]
*  Yeah, okay, fair enough. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4824.84s)]
*  I just think it's easier to feel like [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4825.88s)]
*  you got tricked out of something. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4827.52s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4830.08s)]
*  Like, I don't think any girl wants to go, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4830.92s)]
*  I don't think any girl wants to go, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4833.8s)]
*  man, I gave that guy some pussy [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4835.88s)]
*  because he took me on a boat. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4837.2s)]
*  Like, I don't think at the end of the day [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4839.24s)]
*  they want to feel like it's that transactional. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4840.48s)]
*  So I think with a lot of girls, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4842.4s)]
*  I think they'd rather go, he was so nice to me, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4843.96s)]
*  he loved me, he was saying all these nice things, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4845.96s)]
*  he texted and whatever, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4847.48s)]
*  and then he just stopped doing that once we have sex. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4848.4s)]
*  It's just like, I mean, if the first thing a guy does [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4850.5199999999995s)]
*  with you is takes you on a fucking boat [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4854.44s)]
*  or something like that, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4856.48s)]
*  you should be very aware of his intentions with you. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4857.599999999999s)]
*  Very aware. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4860.679999999999s)]
*  Like, I would tell that to women right now. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4861.5199999999995s)]
*  If the first thing a guy offers to do with you [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4863.2s)]
*  is to take you to the nicest restaurant out there, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4865.84s)]
*  the nicest fucking boat or vacation or whatever, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4868.48s)]
*  there's one thing he wants. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4871.5599999999995s)]
*  There is one thing that he wants. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4873.48s)]
*  I don't know, Shelty. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4875.44s)]
*  He is trying to put in a massive amount of guilt on you [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4876.639999999999s)]
*  for him to have sex with you. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4881.2s)]
*  Because of the implication. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4882.84s)]
*  Because the implication is. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4884.04s)]
*  Have you seen that always on the episode? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4884.88s)]
*  No, tell me. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4886.24s)]
*  You go on a boat, the implication. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4887.92s)]
*  There's an implication. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4889.5199999999995s)]
*  There's an implication. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4890.36s)]
*  We already know what the boat is about. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4891.2s)]
*  We already know what the boat is about. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4892.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't even have to repeat it. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4894.12s)]
*  And you already know it's emblazoned [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4895.12s)]
*  in your mind right now. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4896.44s)]
*  We can agree to disagree on this. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4898.28s)]
*  I just, I think that a lot of the times it may be that, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4899.96s)]
*  but I also feel like, say, hey, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4903.5199999999995s)]
*  if you have a lot of money and you own a boat. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4905.24s)]
*  I'm not listening to this. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4906.88s)]
*  That's the cheapest date you can do. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4907.72s)]
*  Boat is tricky, boat is tricky. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4909.4s)]
*  You own a boat already, then it's like, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4910.84s)]
*  hey, I don't need to spend no money [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4912.76s)]
*  to bring it to a restaurant. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4914.76s)]
*  I could just, on my docked boat. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4915.76s)]
*  You're expensive. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4917.92s)]
*  You're taking a girl on a docked boat, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4918.76s)]
*  you're definitely trying to get ahead. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4919.84s)]
*  That's where you're definitely. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4921.240000000001s)]
*  That's the equivalent to a rich guy, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4922.400000000001s)]
*  hey, let's go for a walking date. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4925.0s)]
*  Who is a walking date? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4927.64s)]
*  Broke niggas. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4929.04s)]
*  What's it doing? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4929.88s)]
*  You wanna come in my Uber pool? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4934.88s)]
*  We're gonna go pick some people up. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4936.200000000001s)]
*  But that date doesn't come, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4938.52s)]
*  a walking date doesn't come [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4939.68s)]
*  with the expectation that we're fucking. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4940.88s)]
*  You don't think they're trying to fuck? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4942.76s)]
*  No, not trying to. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4944.96s)]
*  But not the expectation. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4945.92s)]
*  Expectation, I'm gonna try. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4946.76s)]
*  Now, if you got the hardest reservation in the city [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4949.360000000001s)]
*  to get back in your single days many years ago, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4952.200000000001s)]
*  hardest reservation in the city [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4954.64s)]
*  and you take a girl there, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4956.16s)]
*  the expectation that you're getting sex [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4957.76s)]
*  is exponentially higher than walking date expectations. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4960.320000000001s)]
*  You don't even know this girl yet. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4964.76s)]
*  But what if you. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4965.88s)]
*  All you know about her is you're attracted to her. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4966.72s)]
*  Of course the only thing you wanna do is fuck. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4968.6s)]
*  Yeah, but don't you also wanna make a great impression [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4970.52s)]
*  the first time you take her on a date? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4973.240000000001s)]
*  The hardest reservation in the city, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4974.28s)]
*  you get one of these in your fucking life. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4975.88s)]
*  For the three girls listening right now. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4978.24s)]
*  The shittier place a guy takes you on the first date, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4981.04s)]
*  the more he actually likes you. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4984.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4987.28s)]
*  That's proportional, that's proportional. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4988.12s)]
*  I took my wife to a diner on our first date. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4989.36s)]
*  We are married, we have a child. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4991.96s)]
*  Which diner though, this is important. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4994.12s)]
*  The Soca. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4995.48s)]
*  See, that's different, that's sentimental. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4996.32s)]
*  That's sentimental, but at the same time, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=4998.2s)]
*  it's like I'm not trying to woo you [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5000.0s)]
*  and push all this guilt on you. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5002.32s)]
*  Look at this amazing night I gave you. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5004.84s)]
*  And then if you could talk to girls. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5005.68s)]
*  There are girls who are like, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5007.04s)]
*  begrudgingly will do sexual acts with a dude [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5008.68s)]
*  because they feel bad that the guy [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5011.32s)]
*  has given them so much for that night. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5012.92s)]
*  And that's exactly what that guy's trying to do. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5014.4s)]
*  He's trying to put you in a position [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5016.56s)]
*  where you feel bad enough to make him orgasm. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5018.72s)]
*  It's a thousand percent true. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5021.64s)]
*  I'm not gonna act like 10 years ago, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5022.4800000000005s)]
*  that was his virgin of a high end date. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5023.64s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5025.6s)]
*  Those froggies are gone expensive. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5029.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5030.64s)]
*  We not going cap right now, bro. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5032.32s)]
*  It's an iconic spot. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5034.24s)]
*  He's like, yo, this place means so much to me. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5035.08s)]
*  Like, you was trying. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5037.599999999999s)]
*  Nah, I didn't take it to Chipotle, bro. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5039.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5041.12s)]
*  That's what he has. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5041.959999999999s)]
*  So not the cheaper, but that's like a mid tier, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5042.799999999999s)]
*  sentimental, not super nice, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5045.2s)]
*  but this place means something. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5047.44s)]
*  That's a sweet first date. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5048.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm taking you to, I don't know what's, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5050.0s)]
*  Terese is the hardest place to get into or whatever. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5052.2s)]

*  Y'all ain't anybody in there. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5065.4s)]
*  I walk into Terese and Miles is sitting next to me [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5067.639999999999s)]

*  Hey, don't you forget it. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5081.0s)]
*  There's an expectation that comes with that, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5085.84s)]
*  and acting like that isn't a reality is crazy [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5087.84s)]
*  because women feel the pressure too. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5090.4400000000005s)]
*  They feel the expectation. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5091.72s)]

*  Can I just say one thing? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5109.96s)]
*  Can't it be on both of them? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5110.92s)]
*  Because shouldn't the guy be in front. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5111.76s)]
*  No. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5112.96s)]

*  We just try them. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5116.92s)]
*  Can I just say one thing? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5118.04s)]
*  The responsibility for defense is on the team [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5119.4800000000005s)]
*  that has the goal. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5123.08s)]
*  Woo! [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5124.72s)]

*  This is against the board. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5129.76s)]
*  This guy's on fire! [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5130.6s)]
*  Is it a good metaphor? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5131.4400000000005s)]
*  Let him cook. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5132.36s)]
*  Let him cook. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5133.2s)]
*  They're bitches. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5134.04s)]
*  No, you lost it. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5135.2s)]
*  You lost it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5138.4s)]
*  You're cooking it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5139.24s)]
*  You gotta be even harder. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5140.08s)]
*  The responsibility for defense is on the team [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5141.88s)]
*  that has the goal. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5144.08s)]
*  Women have a goal. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5144.92s)]
*  We can't get inside without their permission. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5146.24s)]
*  We cannot. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5148.4s)]
*  That is illegal. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5149.24s)]
*  You go to jail. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5150.08s)]
*  Or at least it's completely covered up by the government. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5150.92s)]
*  Yeah, and it never happens. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5153.0s)]
*  And that never happened at all, right? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5154.48s)]
*  But, so the responsibility for defense [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5155.92s)]
*  is on the team with the goal. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5157.92s)]
*  They have the goal. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5158.76s)]
*  They have to know the defense. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5159.599999999999s)]
*  They have to know the different tricks of the game [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5161.12s)]
*  that guys are gonna try to do to get in there. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5163.2s)]
*  Because guys are not gonna change about that. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5164.679999999999s)]
*  But they can be defensive. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5166.36s)]
*  And we know they can be defensive [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5167.84s)]
*  because they post videos of them walking down the street [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5169.24s)]
*  ignoring all the guys. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5171.599999999999s)]
*  Being a girl in New York, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5172.84s)]
*  walking down the street one day, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5173.84s)]
*  and all the guys saying hi, hello, whatever. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5174.96s)]
*  They're used to playing defense. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5176.68s)]
*  They play defense all day. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5177.72s)]
*  Their existence around men is 99% defense. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5178.96s)]
*  So let's not act like they don't play. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5183.88s)]
*  What if the guy lies to them? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5184.72s)]
*  What if the guy lies and says, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5185.88s)]
*  hey, I love you, I wanna be with you? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5187.16s)]
*  Then they're crazy. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5188.8s)]
*  They said that one day in, they're crazy. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5190.72s)]
*  That's a crazy person. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5192.76s)]
*  Every, if you believe that, you're arrogant. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5193.92s)]
*  They read fucking smut novels [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5197.96s)]
*  where they fall in love on the first day. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5199.88s)]
*  What do you think they are? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5201.76s)]
*  So your argument is that they're stupid? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5202.6s)]
*  I read smut novels too. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5205.16s)]
*  See? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5206.719999999999s)]
*  So you're both stupid, okay? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5207.5599999999995s)]
*  No, yeah, I think that we gotta stop infantilizing women. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5211.08s)]
*  We gotta prepare them for the real world. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5214.16s)]
*  Like if a guy's throwing crazy shit at you, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5215.799999999999s)]
*  just know the expectation. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5218.08s)]
*  If a guy's treating you like he treats the bottle girls, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5219.16s)]
*  you're a bottle girl. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5223.839999999999s)]
*  Like think about that. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5226.16s)]
*  If a guy is treating you the same way he treats [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5227.48s)]
*  the livestock, the cattle that gets moved [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5230.799999999999s)]
*  from table to table at the club, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5233.12s)]
*  or gets ordered to go on a boat, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5234.88s)]
*  or gets flown to the different countries for the parties, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5237.0s)]
*  there are women that are livestock. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5239.08s)]
*  That's their job. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5240.32s)]
*  And livestock is good. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5241.16s)]
*  Livestock is good. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5242.0s)]
*  We respect the livestock. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5242.84s)]
*  But that is their job, right? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5244.0s)]
*  Like if he treats you in the same way, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5245.32s)]
*  he's asking you to do the same things [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5247.04s)]
*  that he does the livestock, you're also livestock. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5248.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5251.12s)]
*  To him. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5251.96s)]
*  That's not who you are as a person, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5252.8s)]
*  but to him you're livestock, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5253.62s)]
*  so you have to act accordingly. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5254.68s)]
*  It can't be all on the women though. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5255.88s)]
*  The guy should be honest. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5258.24s)]
*  Like we can't just be like, oh, the guy's off the hook, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5260.5599999999995s)]
*  you should have known. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5262.68s)]
*  Like nah, come on, a little bit is on the guy. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5263.6s)]
*  We should be allowed to lie. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5265.52s)]
*  I think we should be allowed to lie, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5268.56s)]
*  because they lie. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5269.68s)]
*  They lie. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5272.360000000001s)]
*  You're not that tall, your eyelashes aren't that long. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5273.280000000001s)]
*  Your nails aren't that big. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5276.400000000001s)]
*  Alan ain't that tall either. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5277.240000000001s)]
*  His nails don't look like this. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5279.08s)]
*  We should be allowed to lie. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5280.8s)]
*  We should be allowed to lie. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5282.08s)]

*  you can ask them for a discount. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5860.08s)]
*  And they just give you a discount. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5861.96s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5863.04s)]
*  The Jews, bro. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5864.36s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5865.32s)]
*  This is why anti-Semitism in New York City, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5866.36s)]
*  like keep it away from B&H. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5868.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5870.799999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5872.84s)]
*  It's very suspicious. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5875.44s)]
*  Dude, that's just somewhere else, all right? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5878.28s)]
*  We cannot risk losing B&H. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5879.719999999999s)]
*  No, yeah. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5881.44s)]
*  The Antifada has to stay away. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5882.28s)]
*  Yeah, we cannot globalize the Antifada [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5883.639999999999s)]
*  because we need B&H, we need Adorama. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5885.28s)]
*  That's why Zoran can't win, dude. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5887.48s)]
*  If Zoran wins and shuts down B&H. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5889.679999999999s)]
*  And there's a government funded camera store. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5891.92s)]
*  That's what he's gonna do. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5893.719999999999s)]
*  And then it reverses. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5894.6s)]
*  I can't fucking have that. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5897.280000000001s)]
*  You see what it does. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5898.72s)]
*  Nah, if he shuts down B&H, we ride it. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5900.200000000001s)]
*  Fuck it up. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5902.360000000001s)]
*  100%. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5903.200000000001s)]
*  No, I'll ride for B&H. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5904.04s)]
*  You know the guy who owns that shit? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5905.92s)]
*  Apparently takes a salary of $100,000 a year [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5907.8s)]
*  and just donates the rest of the charity. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5909.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5911.4800000000005s)]

*  the best camera equipment? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5949.84s)]
*  It's no longer in Epstein's basement. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5951.32s)]
*  Just baby hole at the checkout. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5952.92s)]
*  Clear and seal. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5955.6s)]

*  Is it... [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5959.56s)]
*  Is it a... [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5960.400000000001s)]
*  The disappointing day, dude. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5961.24s)]
*  It is disappointing. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5962.76s)]
*  Do we ever find out? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5963.8s)]
*  Is there ever any closure on this? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5965.08s)]
*  Is there ever? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5966.68s)]
*  No. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5967.52s)]
*  It's close. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5968.360000000001s)]
*  So that's it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5969.2s)]
*  It's Kennedy. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5970.04s)]
*  Another JFK. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5970.88s)]
*  This is JFK. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5971.72s)]
*  And then I was watching a Saugers conversation on Tucker. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5972.56s)]
*  I have a great conversation about this. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5977.76s)]
*  Saugers is like really locked in on this. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5978.88s)]
*  I didn't realize that how much he knew about [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5980.8s)]
*  like the whole Epstein saga. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5982.280000000001s)]
*  Like he was amazingly informed. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5984.400000000001s)]
*  But he said something and I just wasn't alive. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5985.92s)]
*  So I wasn't aware of it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5988.84s)]
*  But like the JFK assassination and all like the bullshit [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5989.68s)]
*  around it and the coverups, et cetera. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5993.0s)]
*  He said really like broke the American people's trust [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5995.280000000001s)]
*  in their government. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5997.72s)]
*  And I think that that was coincided with Vietnam [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=5998.56s)]
*  and like these other wars that just were not entirely [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6000.88s)]
*  popular and... [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6002.96s)]
*  MLK. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6005.52s)]
*  And obviously MLK and then JFK. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6007.32s)]
*  And then RFK. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6009.16s)]
*  Well, obviously JFK but RFK. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6010.0s)]
*  And then, but we're already at an all time low [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6012.08s)]
*  in our generation trust in the institutions. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6015.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6019.32s)]
*  This like, does it shatter it more than it's already shatter? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6020.16s)]
*  Like where do we go from here? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6023.36s)]
*  Like how do we trust Trump? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6024.759999999999s)]
*  How do we trust any politician? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6026.44s)]
*  We tried trusting the anti-government guy [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6027.839999999999s)]
*  and he ended up being the government. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6030.12s)]
*  So yeah, like who do you trust now? [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6032.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6034.16s)]
*  For real. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6035.0s)]
*  What would have happened if Trump like just was like, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6036.360000000001s)]
*  this is everything that's going on [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6038.16s)]
*  and just exposed everything. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6039.76s)]
*  Like part of me is trying to like game theory [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6040.96s)]
*  where I'm like, wouldn't that benefit him? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6043.04s)]
*  I think end game. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6044.12s)]
*  Follow this through. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6044.96s)]
*  Like if he comes out and he's like, yo, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6045.8s)]
*  this is how like the wars are working. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6047.28s)]
*  Here's how the foreign influence works. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6049.08s)]
*  Here's how the blackmail thing, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6050.8s)]
*  assuming all of that is true. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6051.92s)]
*  And he just exposes everything. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6053.24s)]
*  It causes a civil war. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6054.88s)]
*  You know, like he puts his life on the line [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6056.360000000001s)]
*  and then he gets a third term, right? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6059.28s)]
*  Like it's possible that like these things could happen. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6062.04s)]
*  I'm like, if he wanted power, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6063.92s)]
*  is it possible that he could just like [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6065.2s)]
*  completely block the system, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6066.48s)]
*  gain the support of the majority of Americans [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6068.36s)]
*  and then just keep the shit pushing? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6070.48s)]
*  And it is possible to recover. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6071.96s)]
*  If he did that, they wouldn't have missed. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6072.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  100%. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6075.4s)]
*  But like it is possible to recover [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6076.24s)]
*  from incredibly like heinous, disgusting acts. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6077.5199999999995s)]
*  Germany is still a country. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6079.96s)]
*  Accountability is necessary. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6082.16s)]
*  You've got to put these people on trial. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6084.08s)]
*  They're responsible for these unbelievably horrific acts. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6086.0s)]
*  So it would require that. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6089.28s)]
*  It would require outing all the people [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6090.92s)]
*  that we're aiding, abetting and protecting, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6093.96s)]
*  even if it's hundreds, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6095.92s)]
*  even if it's thousands of people all across government, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6096.88s)]
*  but it would take that for America [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6099.72s)]
*  to have the faith and confidence in our system. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6102.8s)]
*  And these bad actors are not an indictment [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6105.84s)]
*  on the idea of America. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6110.72s)]
*  They're an abuse of America, right? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6112.4800000000005s)]
*  Just like we were saying about like the churches, right? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6115.96s)]
*  Like the Christian church that when someone leaves, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6118.2s)]
*  doesn't treat them with the same love and kindness [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6122.2s)]
*  is not living up to the ideals of Jesus, right? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6123.96s)]
*  That's more of the cult, as you were saying. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6126.12s)]
*  And it's like, you can extract these people, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6128.08s)]
*  you can punish them and you can move on. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6131.24s)]
*  We've seen it happen in other countries, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6133.16s)]
*  but it takes an unbelievably brave soul to out that [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6135.12s)]
*  and probably will take their life. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6139.92s)]
*  Like that is probably the cost. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6141.5599999999995s)]
*  Unless you win. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6144.639999999999s)]
*  Which is why I'm like, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6145.84s)]
*  I don't know if Trump is like a pure dictator [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6146.679999999999s)]
*  in the historical sense, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6149.16s)]
*  because if he was, it seems like the environment now [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6150.52s)]
*  is sort of ripe for a dictator to come through [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6152.88s)]
*  and could actually work, you know what I mean? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6156.320000000001s)]
*  And the fact that he's kind of like working within [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6158.160000000001s)]
*  sort of like the lines of a little bit, you know what I mean? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6159.88s)]
*  Obviously he steps out of the overdue window, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6162.68s)]
*  but like there's still a little bit of, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6164.400000000001s)]
*  like guidelines he's working within, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6166.6s)]
*  like with the big, beautiful bill. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6167.88s)]
*  Leads me to believe like, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6169.72s)]
*  oh, this is just more institutional [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6170.68s)]
*  kind of political bureaucracy. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6172.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think they sat him down there and were like, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6173.88s)]
*  listen, we're just gonna kill everybody in your family? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6175.360000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6178.04s)]
*  What? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6178.88s)]
*  What? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6179.72s)]
*  What are you bringing this up? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6180.56s)]
*  He's so calloused and terrifying. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6182.52s)]
*  Like I wonder if that's possible. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6184.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that, I wonder if there's a conversation [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6186.0s)]
*  where it's just like, hey, listen, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6187.52s)]
*  your family is currently on a trip to Aspen [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6188.92s)]
*  and here's the flight and there's five hours [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6194.4800000000005s)]
*  where it's gonna be in the air [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6196.88s)]
*  and it might fall out of the air. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6198.12s)]
*  So we're gonna have you do these certain things [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6200.12s)]
*  or else your family will really never be able to fly again [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6202.76s)]
*  because we'll just shoot the plane out of the sky [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6204.8s)]
*  and then just said it's another Boeing issue. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6207.4s)]
*  Like I wonder if it's that simple. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6210.0s)]
*  But then who would be the person [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6211.719999999999s)]
*  having that combo with them? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6213.719999999999s)]
*  That's what we don't know. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6215.08s)]
*  And I think that's what's so frustrating [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6216.599999999999s)]
*  is like who is the permanent government? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6218.08s)]
*  Who is the quote unquote deep state? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6219.679999999999s)]
*  Who are the people pulling the levers? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6221.12s)]
*  It's not John Radcliffe [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6222.599999999999s)]
*  or whoever the new leader of the CIA is. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6224.04s)]
*  There was a leader of the CIA before him. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6227.0s)]
*  Who are the people who don't get elected [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6229.08s)]
*  but always exist in the CIA? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6231.08s)]
*  If the CIA is the one that's pulling the strings [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6233.4s)]
*  and in control, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6235.44s)]
*  who's like the head of the Pentagon? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6236.76s)]
*  They have this like black budget. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6239.2s)]
*  They could spend as much money [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6240.360000000001s)]
*  doing whatever the fuck they want. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6241.280000000001s)]
*  Like who controls that? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6242.320000000001s)]
*  Who controls that spending? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6244.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's another really frustrating thing [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6246.6s)]
*  for Americans is like who is in control then? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6248.400000000001s)]
*  Like it seems like Trump can do certain things [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6252.240000000001s)]
*  he wants to do and they don't meddle with it. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6254.08s)]
*  But the second he gets into that space, it gets shut down. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6257.08s)]
*  And I imagine that's the same thing for, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6261.6s)]
*  like didn't Kennedy say, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6263.4800000000005s)]
*  there's a quote here. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6265.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6268.88s)]
*  It's like, didn't Kennedy say that thing where, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6269.72s)]
*  maybe it wasn't Kennedy, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6273.52s)]
*  but didn't Kennedy come after the CIA? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6274.8s)]
*  Didn't he want to dismantle the CIA [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6276.36s)]
*  and they dismantled his head? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6277.84s)]
*  Yeah, it seems about right. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6279.04s)]
*  You know, I think that like [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6281.96s)]
*  we might be in conspiratorial land right now, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6283.52s)]
*  but like, you know, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6285.36s)]
*  was Lincoln saying a certain thing? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6286.52s)]
*  Like who are these power brokers? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6288.12s)]
*  Who are the people that are pulling these strings [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6289.88s)]
*  and are willing to do the most, you know, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6291.32s)]
*  sadistic things in order to maintain that power? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6293.32s)]
*  I don't think it's American presidents [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6296.0s)]
*  because if there's been a few of them brave enough [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6298.32s)]
*  to try to dismantle it and all of them end up dead. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6300.92s)]
*  So I don't think it's our politicians [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6303.759999999999s)]
*  that we democratically elect. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6305.48s)]
*  So who are the people that are not elected? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6307.44s)]
*  And who are the people that are permanently in government? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6309.16s)]
*  And it's crazy that there isn't even conspiracy [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6311.48s)]
*  about who they are. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6314.759999999999s)]
*  It's like so entrenched and so disguised. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6317.5199999999995s)]
*  Who do you point to? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6321.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it's like specific individual [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6324.28s)]
*  like people that are just like, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6327.48s)]
*  oh, you're like the secret dictator. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6329.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's just like a network [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6330.4s)]
*  of people with influence. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6331.639999999999s)]
*  Like if you're like the chairman of like the Fed, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6332.679999999999s)]
*  if you're like the, you know, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6336.4s)]
*  the chairman of like the, you know, WEF or like, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6338.32s)]
*  like I wonder if it's decentralized [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6341.48s)]
*  but people kind of talk. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6345.36s)]
*  Like I don't know if it's like one centralized [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6347.12s)]
*  like Illuminati type force that exists within the government [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6348.719999999999s)]
*  or if it's like different factions of power [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6352.04s)]
*  that are all kind of moving against each other at times [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6354.5199999999995s)]
*  and they're playing like an underground chess game. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6357.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6361.2s)]
*  The way how Bernie didn't want to speak [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6362.04s)]
*  about the death threats, that was telling. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6363.16s)]
*  You know, yeah, like Bernie, Bernie. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6366.679999999999s)]
*  And he speaks about everything. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6369.719999999999s)]
*  Bernie talks about everything. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6371.0s)]
*  And the second we asked him, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6372.84s)]
*  like have you had your life risked or whatever like that, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6373.759999999999s)]
*  he's like, I'd rather not talk about that. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6376.08s)]
*  They tried to kill that motherfucker [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6377.48s)]
*  or they didn't try. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6379.2s)]
*  Or they had the combo with them. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6381.400000000001s)]
*  They had the combo. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6382.24s)]
*  Maybe, or it's like a psycho stalker [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6383.52s)]
*  and he's like, I don't want to give these people credit. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6385.400000000001s)]
*  Say again? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6387.56s)]
*  That's boring, put your hat back. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6388.52s)]
*  No, no, I appreciate, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6390.16s)]
*  I appreciate Mark, you making sure [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6393.88s)]
*  that we don't go off the rails here. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6395.8s)]
*  I've seen off the rails. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6397.6s)]
*  Now that we're, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6398.76s)]
*  now that we're, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6399.6s)]
*  when do we go off the rails? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6400.4400000000005s)]
*  So not today, in my life. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6403.08s)]
*  I know what off the rails conspiracy vibes can do. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6404.88s)]
*  Can you give us some of those? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6407.88s)]
*  We're on the rails. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6408.96s)]
*  We acknowledge that the rails exists and we're on them. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6409.8s)]
*  Now can you tell me how far it goes? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6411.88s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6413.84s)]
*  Can we call? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6415.24s)]
*  All right, in what, in what? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6416.08s)]
*  Everything. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6417.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6418.24s)]
*  Everything Mark, everything. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6419.72s)]
*  And if you feel uncomfortable with anything, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6421.88s)]
*  we'll just cut it out, but everything. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6422.92s)]
*  Okay, you have elite bloodlines [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6426.56s)]
*  in every nation in the world [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6429.320000000001s)]
*  that have been in power since, you know, 500. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6430.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, and they control actually everything. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6433.28s)]
*  And all the richest people in the world [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6435.08s)]
*  are actually royal families within these countries. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6436.2s)]
*  And some names that we know, you know what I mean? [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6438.92s)]
*  Like the name changes of like the Rockefellers, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6441.04s)]
*  the Rothschilds, they control global finance. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6443.400000000001s)]
*  They move the levers. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6445.88s)]
*  They play both sides of the war so that they always win. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6446.72s)]
*  And they're the ones that are actually in control, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6448.96s)]
*  trying to create a global world order [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6450.68s)]
*  where ultimately they will have control over all of humanity. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6452.16s)]
*  So it really doesn't matter what country they reside in. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6455.12s)]
*  Because America is just the current hegemony. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6457.76s)]
*  It used to be Britain, it used to be France. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6459.52s)]
*  It used to be any nation and eventually it'll be China, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6461.36s)]
*  but we're already over there. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6463.52s)]
*  And by we, I mean those people. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6464.4800000000005s)]
*  And they will entrench themselves in those places [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6465.68s)]
*  so that they can maintain their positions of power. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6469.200000000001s)]
*  Because what's better than controlling one country? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6471.12s)]
*  When you control the world. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6473.280000000001s)]
*  The octopus's tentacles go all over. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6475.52s)]
*  Can you keep going on this? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6477.280000000001s)]
*  Because this is really fun. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6478.360000000001s)]
*  So you can like, they call it everything. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6479.8s)]
*  How do they utilize these systems? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6481.8s)]
*  How do they blackmail people? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6483.280000000001s)]
*  How do they? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6484.56s)]
*  Well, you have to create a central bank. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6485.4400000000005s)]
*  Why is that so important? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6486.96s)]
*  That way you can control all the money. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6488.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, all the money. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6489.6s)]
*  And why is the control of the money so crucial? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6490.4400000000005s)]
*  Because you can put people in debt, you can destroy them. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6492.56s)]
*  And you can basically pull the levers to decide [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6495.32s)]
*  who gets power and who doesn't, [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6497.68s)]
*  because we live in a capitalist system. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6498.92s)]
*  And every nation basically operates under these rules. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6500.08s)]
*  Even if they are dictatorships, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6501.92s)]
*  they still operate with this sort of trade agreement. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6504.24s)]
*  So who controls the central bank [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6505.92s)]
*  in the United States of America? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6507.360000000001s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6509.92s)]
*  This is why they always go there. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6510.76s)]
*  This is why I always go. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6515.76s)]
*  But who does? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6516.6s)]
*  Because my understanding is that the institutional banks [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6517.4400000000005s)]
*  in America are all run by like Irish guys. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6520.6s)]
*  The hedge funds and stuff are Jews. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6523.6s)]
*  That's what they want you to think. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6525.360000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6526.6s)]
*  No, but if you look up, it's kind of a, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6528.400000000001s)]
*  what is the term, a misnomer or something like that? [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6531.8s)]
*  It's a false conspiracy that Jews run the banks. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6534.72s)]
*  Because the actual real institutional banks [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6537.56s)]
*  are run by Irish guys. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6540.04s)]
*  And then the hedge funds and stuff can be run by Jews, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6541.4400000000005s)]
*  but that's not where the real power is. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6543.76s)]
*  The power is within the institutional banks. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6545.280000000001s)]
*  But the central bank is different [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6547.160000000001s)]
*  from the institutional banks. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6548.4800000000005s)]
*  Because the institutional banks are getting their money [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6549.96s)]
*  from the central bank. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6551.6s)]
*  So who does control the central bank? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6553.0s)]
*  The deep state. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6555.64s)]
*  But like, is there a group? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6556.84s)]
*  Is there a family? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6558.52s)]
*  I know Jerome Powell is like the chairman [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6559.36s)]
*  of the Fed right now, but he gets put, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6561.12s)]
*  he's a new guy that's thrown in there. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6563.56s)]
*  You know, there was someone before him. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6565.72s)]
*  I'm trying to remember this book. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6567.44s)]
*  What was it? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6569.28s)]
*  The Monster of Jekyll Island. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6570.12s)]
*  That like in 1914, they came together [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6571.68s)]
*  and they're like, we're gonna make this central bank. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6573.8s)]
*  And every country is gonna have one. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6575.2s)]
*  If they don't have one, we topple their regime. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6576.24s)]
*  And so everyone needs to have a central bank [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6578.48s)]
*  and then it's all controlled by a family. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6580.0s)]
*  Which family? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6582.84s)]
*  You've heard the Rothschild shit. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6584.16s)]
*  This is where it all falls apart, I don't know. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6585.360000000001s)]
*  But like, I've heard the Rothschild shit. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6586.64s)]
*  And like, I'm trying to like make both arguments. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6588.12s)]
*  I'm sure there's huge advantages for having a central bank. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6590.56s)]
*  I.e. you have COVID come around, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6593.76s)]
*  we could print a few trillion dollars [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6596.64s)]
*  and people can continue to eat [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6598.2s)]
*  when they're not going out there and working. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6599.4800000000005s)]
*  So they're definitely like, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6601.16s)]
*  the central bank can't be so oppressive [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6603.08s)]
*  that the people revolt. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6605.16s)]
*  It has to maintain enough of a status quo [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6607.24s)]
*  where the people are distracted enough [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6609.76s)]
*  that they'll allow the power to reside [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6611.66s)]
*  in like this small group of people, right? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6614.22s)]
*  But like, what is that group of people? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6617.34s)]
*  Is there somebody's name on the central bank of America? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6619.82s)]
*  Is there one family? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6622.3s)]
*  Is it, like that's what I'm trying to say. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6623.46s)]
*  Yes, I don't know. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6625.3s)]
*  I mean, again, I'm kind of riffing on like [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6626.139999999999s)]
*  old school conspiracy shit that I read [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6627.26s)]
*  when I was in high school on YouTube. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6628.74s)]
*  This is feelings, this is feelings, no facts. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6629.82s)]
*  This is feelings, no facts. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6631.86s)]
*  I actually don't know what the family is [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6632.7s)]
*  that controls the central bank. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6634.38s)]
*  I mean, can we give it a Google? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6635.7s)]
*  I'm sure Chad GVT has an answer. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6637.139999999999s)]
*  Or is that what you have to tell us? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6637.98s)]
*  My handler said I have to step down. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6640.0599999999995s)]
*  Holy shit, has Mark been put here? [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6642.0599999999995s)]

*  And he was like, nah, I don't think you have it. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6648.46s)]
*  No way. I was like, come on, dude. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6650.1s)]
*  I could be a good one. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6651.14s)]
*  I could do something. Why? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6651.98s)]
*  I could do something. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6652.82s)]
*  Jealous of your hair, probably, this guy. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6653.7s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, oh, you're like a nice guy. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6655.14s)]

*  and like they were friends and like said [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6664.76s)]
*  he was gonna hire him for this job [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6666.18s)]

*  He was like, all right, that's not actually the job. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6668.98s)]
*  We would like you to work for us [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6671.66s)]
*  and basically all you have to do is talk to people, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6673.339999999999s)]
*  be friends with people, and then one day [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6676.54s)]
*  we're gonna ask you where those people are [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6678.339999999999s)]

*  He goes, no, you have to tell me right now. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6686.0599999999995s)]

*  I just need to think about it. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6689.66s)]
*  They walk out of the room together [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6691.58s)]

*  No, no, no. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6711.54s)]
*  Duff got too much empathy. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6712.54s)]
*  He's too nice for that shit. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6716.0199999999995s)]
*  So does my friend. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6717.179999999999s)]

*  I also think that, I don't think he was aligned with, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6719.759999999999s)]
*  I don't think he feels like Israeli. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6722.62s)]
*  Like he's Jewish, but I don't think he's like, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6725.099999999999s)]
*  I think he feels more American. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6727.58s)]
*  But like, isn't that wild? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6728.78s)]
*  I'm sure that happens with CIA all the time. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=6731.54s)]

*  Six days later, I still got it. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7063.74s)]
*  I call a virtual doctor, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7067.26s)]

*  oh yeah, you just probably got a bacteria. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7081.780000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna put you on some antibiotics. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7083.14s)]

*  so it can read your labs. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7098.42s)]
*  You could send them a little sample of your shit. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7100.38s)]
*  There's a company doing that actually. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7102.22s)]

*  You were saying that about a white woman. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7112.900000000001s)]
*  The doctor said this shit during the visit. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7114.22s)]
*  It just kind of cracked me up. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7116.5s)]

*  and he's just gonna give me the antibiotics. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7120.18s)]
*  But he got to make it feel like a doctor's appointment. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7121.42s)]
*  So he goes, one point he goes, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7123.82s)]
*  can you just open your mouth and stick out your tongue? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7126.42s)]
*  I'm like, there ain't no way you can see anything, bro. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXu_PARro8&t=7129.22s)]
