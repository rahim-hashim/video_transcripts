*  What have you been doing? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=117.76s)]
*  Breastfeeding every two fucking hours for the last seven months? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=118.64s)]
*  I get it, you're tired. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=122.48s)]
*  I'm also tired. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=123.36s)]

*  Playing DJ songs, Mark. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=127.12s)]
*  He was about to say something else inappropriate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=129.68s)]
*  I was about to say basketball and I was like, wait a second, that's racist. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=131.28s)]
*  Actually, it's not racist. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=133.84s)]
*  That is his literal job. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=134.8s)]

*  You picked a hell of a weekend not to come on tour, bro. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=143.2s)]
*  I know, what the fuck? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't think we could do Vegas better than we did. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=147.2s)]

*  Big I didn't say that because my wife already tired and I'm tired. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=161.44s)]
*  Me and your wife are both very mad at you right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=165.44s)]
*  I want you to know that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=167.12s)]

*  I cannot help that I need eight hours of sleep in order to function. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=169.12s)]
*  Brad has a fucking ice cold killer, by the way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=172.72s)]
*  What did I do? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=174.64s)]
*  So I had a higher purpose this weekend. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=176.16s)]
*  I couldn't make it to Vegas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, valid reasons. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=178.72s)]
*  And so I run the group chat. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=179.92s)]
*  What did you have to do? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=181.35999999999999s)]

*  What's your higher purpose? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=185.28s)]
*  It all will be known soon. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=186.32s)]
*  I have a higher purpose. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  I was busy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=189.44s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=190.16s)]
*  I was busy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  I was doing spots for the city. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=191.76s)]
*  I had a 20 senior I was doing in Brooklyn. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=194.32s)]
*  He had a audition for Czech spots and you were coming. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=196.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was busy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=198.0s)]
*  So anyway, I said in the group chat as everyone's leaving, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=199.92s)]
*  I'm going to miss you guys so much. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Have a great time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And then the next text within three seconds, remove Mark from the group chat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=204.48s)]
*  You don't want to hear him crying this whole weekend. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=209.44s)]
*  He's not there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Three seconds later. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Sending little fucking gifts and shit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  Mark, Mark's been removed from the group chat. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=215.27999999999997s)]
*  I was like, damn. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=217.11999999999998s)]

*  Yeah, fucking Gestapo. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=220.72s)]

*  Was Tanya out there? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=226.48s)]
*  No, she wasn't out there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=227.44s)]

*  Coming to you from Shultz's chair. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=717.44s)]
*  Because I'm going on the road. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=718.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, baby. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=720.08s)]
*  I'm doing a couple one-nighters coming up in November. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  November 13th, Stanford, Connecticut. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=723.52s)]
*  I'm going to New York Comedy Club, one of the best clubs in the city. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=725.6s)]
*  They got us out in Stanford. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=728.48s)]
*  Come hang out with him. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=730.08s)]
*  I'm going to kick it with everybody. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  We're going to Soul Jolls and Pottstown, PA, like an hour from Philly. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=732.24s)]
*  Just come out. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=736.08s)]
*  Come hang. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=736.72s)]
*  I'll be taking pictures with everyone. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  We'll be talking after the show. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=738.64s)]
*  We'll be chopping it up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=739.76s)]
*  Going through probably conspiracy theories and just current events. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  So if you want to come hang, Soul Jolls, Pottstown, PA. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=743.84s)]
*  Come see him, Sluts. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=746.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=748.08s)]
*  You know what you need to do? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=748.4s)]
*  Every time. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=749.68s)]
*  Love that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=750.88s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=753.36s)]
*  This is how dope. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=754.4s)]
*  Can I just break this up? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  This is how fucking dope UFC was. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=756.24s)]
*  So we had the most amazing seats, right? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=759.36s)]
*  But there's six of us. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=761.28s)]
*  We roll pretty fucking deep. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=763.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=764.4s)]
*  What is that saying? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=764.64s)]
*  It's like you want to go fast, go low. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=765.36s)]
*  You want to go far and go with people. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=767.28s)]
*  Like we always roll deep. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=768.4s)]
*  And I already know when this is like the fucking event. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=769.84s)]
*  So they're like, don't worry. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=773.6s)]
*  We got you. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=774.48s)]
*  Their seats were, I think, the second best seats in the whole arena. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=774.98s)]
*  Because they sat front row at the first thing up. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=784.4200000000001s)]
*  So the first elevation of seating, right? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=789.38s)]
*  So now they're not looking at the back of anybody's head. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=791.94s)]
*  Even if you're on the floor behind us, you're looking at me standing up like an asshole [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=794.34s)]
*  excited the whole time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=797.46s)]
*  You're looking at Bezos' giant shoulders trying to see. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=798.58s)]
*  Bezos is fucking ripped back. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=801.14s)]
*  You got six, six dudes just in the front row. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=803.06s)]
*  So you can't sit. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=806.26s)]
*  I mean, yeah, whatever. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=808.5s)]
*  They just took him. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=809.38s)]
*  They were great. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=809.9399999999999s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=810.42s)]
*  What's crazy about the room is then you hear people that were in the 200 section and the 300 section. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=810.9799999999999s)]
*  They love their seats because that's where you actually got the best experience of the dome. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=816.26s)]
*  The feel is kind of like there's no bad seats. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=821.06s)]
*  Bro, it was. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=823.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, this is what I was going to say, like what it was. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=824.8199999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=827.2199999999999s)]
*  I was looking at the actual fighters fighting. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=829.14s)]
*  And my brain couldn't distinguish that from a video game, meaning everything else that was going around. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=831.3s)]
*  I think there's some something happened in my head where it assumed that the octagon itself and the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=839.6999999999999s)]
*  fighters in it were also some form of animation. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=845.78s)]
*  That was the Adderall. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=849.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=850.18s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=850.9s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=853.3s)]
*  You got a good point right there. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=854.02s)]
*  But it was just it was like. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=856.02s)]
*  It was cool in the videos I saw because you could hear the crowd reacting to the graphics. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=857.7s)]
*  A thing would fly over and be like, oh. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=862.82s)]
*  It was because basically they put these little vignettes in between the fights. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=866.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=870.1s)]
*  And the vignettes were just mind blowing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=870.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't even think we've scratched the surface of what the sphere will do for live entertainment. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=873.7s)]
*  I was thinking that all weekend. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=878.9000000000001s)]
*  It's like when they I've said this before, but like it's literally like when they added sound to film. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=881.7s)]
*  I think it will be that transformative. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=886.66s)]
*  I think there'll be a sphere in every major city, different sizes. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=888.1s)]
*  Maybe you don't need a 20,000 seat sphere if you're in a smaller city, but every city will have one. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=891.86s)]
*  And that's where these specific types of events will take place. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=896.74s)]
*  And I mean, it will just it's just going to. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=900.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if you can build it logistically. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=905.38s)]
*  What if a football stadium is the sphere? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=907.86s)]
*  I was thinking that I was like, oh, you need 100,000 seats or whatever. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=909.78s)]
*  So I don't know if you can build it, but that's insane. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=913.54s)]
*  So that would be awesome. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=915.6999999999999s)]
*  It maybe will have end up doing that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=916.58s)]
*  The tricky thing about this fear right now is that it's so cost prohibitive. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=918.5s)]
*  I mean, like in order to film something and create something for this fear, you got to do it in 14K. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=922.1s)]
*  It takes two whole days to upload the stuff. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=927.54s)]
*  OK, because and then you have to wrap it around and distort it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=931.46s)]
*  So I think hopefully AI will be able to do a lot of the creation of this, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=935.54s)]
*  because right now the only bands that can be in there are groups that can stay there for like [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=940.42s)]
*  a month. Yeah. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=944.9s)]
*  And then how many of those are there? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=946.02s)]
*  Like, I bet you the UFC actually, I don't know, because they probably just made so much money. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=947.4599999999999s)]
*  They've been put. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=951.54s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they lost money on the actual event [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=952.02s)]
*  just because they had to pay for the production of it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=955.3s)]
*  I was wondering if they actually make money or not. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=957.54s)]
*  And I shall say, Dana, aside from him taking care of you, I was I remember being like, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=959.3s)]
*  this is so cool to take this on. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=963.4599999999999s)]
*  What an ambitious undertaking for a live event. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=965.3s)]
*  I can't imagine any other sports commissioner or whatever being like, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=968.02s)]
*  yo, let's take this on one time just to make an event out of it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=971.3s)]
*  And they were fucking bummed about the last two fights being boring. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=974.74s)]
*  And I get it because it's like you put everything on it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=977.78s)]
*  And it's like, this is the entire world is watching. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=982.26s)]
*  This is the moment. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=985.7s)]
*  And then the last two are like stinkers where it's like, yes, yes, they won. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=986.74s)]
*  Yes, they were more effective. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=992.5s)]
*  But it just so happens that that style of fighting isn't the most engaging. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=994.26s)]
*  Visually, it's not pleasing. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=998.58s)]
*  It's not pleasing. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=999.62s)]
*  Like the best thing for the UFC is when strikers are the best fighters. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1000.26s)]
*  That's what makes it the most engaging. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1003.62s)]
*  You could track any rise in popularity of the UFC over the years and guarantee it's [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1004.9s)]
*  one of the best fighters or strikers. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1010.26s)]
*  Anderson Silva, you even had Chuck Liddell, the Iceman, all these moments. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1012.9s)]
*  Obviously, John Jones is a pedigree with wrestling, but he's knocking motherfuckers [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1016.9s)]
*  the fuck out too. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1020.58s)]
*  Connor, Izzy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1021.22s)]
*  Connor, Izzy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1021.62s)]
*  You just track it and it works. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1023.46s)]
*  Because a knockout is exciting. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1026.74s)]
*  We talk about it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1028.1s)]
*  We replay it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1028.74s)]
*  We can't replay one minute of Sean and Malibian on the ground. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1029.54s)]
*  Yeah, it was somebody laying on top of them. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1033.06s)]
*  It's just not a highlight. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1034.5s)]
*  But what I will say is after that, the conversation in Vegas was just about the spectacle. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1035.54s)]
*  So I'm sure you all saw this, but they would show us outside the sphere. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1044.58s)]
*  They're just showing like the fights or whatever. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1047.94s)]
*  Imagine we were like, just imagine being in Vegas, walking by the strip and seeing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1050.4199999999998s)]
*  that event outside. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1054.98s)]
*  It's just nuts. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1056.26s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1057.78s)]
*  And it looks amazing on a phone. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1058.6599999999999s)]
*  I thought it was just going to look great in the room if you're there, but I saw [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1060.98s)]
*  everyone who was filming and I was like, holy shit, it looks like you're there. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1064.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1067.9399999999998s)]
*  How was it when you guys watch it at home? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1070.1s)]
*  What was it like at home? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1073.46s)]
*  So again, the fight card was boring, but you could tell whoever was there was getting [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1075.1399999999999s)]
*  the last two were boring. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1078.82s)]
*  An event. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1079.78s)]
*  Well, that's really all I got to see. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1080.1s)]
*  My show's ended at midnight or whatever. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1081.3s)]
*  The one before the last two fights, or it was like two before that, two guys who [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1083.22s)]
*  I had no fucking clue. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1088.26s)]
*  It might be one of the greatest rounds of fighting I've ever seen in my time. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1089.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1092.74s)]
*  We heard you. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1094.02s)]
*  Did you see it? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1094.9s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1095.54s)]
*  I heard Diego Lopez, Brian Ortega fight. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1096.74s)]
*  That was insane too. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1099.22s)]
*  Zelluber and that one. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1102.26s)]
*  That's the one. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1103.86s)]
*  Rubavich. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1104.82s)]
*  Yeah, Rubavich fights. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1106.74s)]
*  Anyway, go on. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1108.18s)]
*  No, I was just saying how the fights earlier were really amazing and then between the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1109.22s)]
*  fights they did like give you the wide angle and show the little movies in between and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1115.22s)]
*  those are they look phenomenal. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1120.42s)]
*  So the experience at home was still satisfying? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1122.02s)]
*  Yeah, it looks amazing on TV. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1124.74s)]
*  And did it? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1127.3s)]
*  Okay, that's actually important. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1128.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1129.46s)]
*  Now, did it make you want to see an event at the Sphere? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1130.66s)]
*  Very bad. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1134.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1134.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1135.54s)]
*  So the big things. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1135.78s)]
*  You saw the announcement that they're going to put Adapt Wizard of Oz. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1137.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I heard about that. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1141.8600000000001s)]
*  For the Sphere. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1142.58s)]
*  That's going to be nuts. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1143.46s)]
*  $80 million on that reportedly. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1144.5s)]
*  And then over New Year's Eve, like their big EDM play was this DJ Anima. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1146.26s)]
*  I think he has like six or seven dates around that time. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1151.06s)]
*  They keep on like adding. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1153.7s)]
*  After being there, I want to see a DJ. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1155.86s)]
*  I think that's going to be. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1157.62s)]
*  I think that's going to be. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1159.94s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1160.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1162.74s)]
*  I haven't seen the bands. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1163.38s)]
*  I don't know how a band could actually do it because if you really want the music to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1164.5s)]
*  be choreographed with the animation, you can't let them play live. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1172.1s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1179.06s)]
*  Well, because if the songs switch with the animation and you riff it all, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1180.4199999999998s)]
*  you take a moment, you stop, you talk to the crowd, you tell them a story. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1186.4199999999998s)]
*  If that's not also baked in to the animation or they don't have the ability to stop with you, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1190.58s)]
*  now you're off. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1196.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, I think a lot of those big DJs, it's all pre-taped. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1197.62s)]
*  They're just making it. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1201.78s)]
*  That's why I said. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1202.58s)]
*  No, no. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1203.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1204.18s)]
*  So DJ, I think it works because they just press play and then pretend to twist knobs. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1204.42s)]
*  But if you're a band and like, let's say your lead singer wants to like say a few words. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1208.02s)]
*  Which is what makes the show fun. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1212.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1214.02s)]
*  I'll get what you're saying. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1214.34s)]
*  So I think it's one of those things where it's like, let's just see a DJ do it [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1215.3799999999999s)]
*  and then just create that immersive environment. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1220.74s)]
*  And as you're fucking, I don't know if you're on drugs or not, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1223.3s)]
*  but like as you're peeking, you're also looking at these visuals. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1226.66s)]
*  I mean. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1229.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1230.18s)]
*  When I did Rogan, he and I talked about going to see Fish there. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1231.46s)]
*  I don't know Fish, but apparently that's like you go to a douche room, then you go watch them. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1234.98s)]
*  Well, that would make sense. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1238.4199999999998s)]
*  Them at the Sphere would be bonkers. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1238.98s)]
*  They did that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1240.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1240.98s)]
*  They don't have songs. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1241.3799999999999s)]
*  Wait, did Fish do it? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1242.1799999999998s)]
*  I think he was saying Fish was there. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1242.98s)]
*  Grateful Dead. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1244.1s)]
*  Grateful Dead seem to have the crazier visuals. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1245.3799999999999s)]
*  I thought Fish and Grateful Dead. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1246.82s)]
*  Oh, maybe. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1248.1799999999998s)]
*  I think Grateful Dead have the crazier visuals. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1248.82s)]
*  Coldplay, I think, would be Box Office there because they have stadium shows that have [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1251.1399999999999s)]
*  the lights and... [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1255.3s)]
*  Oh, they're great lighting here. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1255.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, what I would just do is I'd say, hey guys, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1257.1399999999999s)]
*  just pretend to play the instruments. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1259.46s)]
*  Play them, but we're not going to have you plugged in or anything like that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1262.82s)]
*  We're going to have like essentially you're going to be background track, like what they [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1266.58s)]
*  would do with like a Britney, and then just have that also for the instruments. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1269.3799999999999s)]
*  Doesn't that suck to do as a performer though? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1272.82s)]
*  I'm curious, does some of the cost get offset since you don't have to pay for the screens [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1274.58s)]
*  and all that stuff to be built there? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1280.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so, but I think what that cost is so minimal compared to like producing [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1282.74s)]
*  the content. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1289.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because I was thinking like if it's a live performance, it's like they have the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1290.02s)]
*  two big screens that is just the cam, and then you really just have to have some filler [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1293.78s)]
*  in between the screens that can be on loop. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1298.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1299.94s)]
*  So it doesn't necessarily have to be that crazy of a feat. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1300.26s)]
*  Yeah, but you want that video that's playing in the background that's like synced to the [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1304.42s)]
*  music to just be mind bending, and to create that, it's an expensive endeavor. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1309.54s)]
*  And like, I mean, but it was fucking crazy. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1316.5s)]
*  I just, to me, this was the best advertisement for the sphere. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1319.62s)]
*  Like I wish the UFC like owned a piece of the sphere, because the second I left, I was [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1323.3799999999999s)]
*  like, I need to see something else there. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1328.02s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, you gotta go back. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1330.02s)]
*  Oh, you have to, I want them to do July 4th. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1331.86s)]
*  I'm like trying to. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1334.98s)]
*  That would be insane. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1335.94s)]
*  Yeah, like they did the Mexican Independence Day. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1337.06s)]
*  All right, run it up. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1339.3799999999999s)]
*  So Jamil brought it up yesterday. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1341.22s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1342.74s)]
*  Nick's playing in the sphere? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1343.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1345.86s)]
*  Like, I don't even know how you do basketball. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1347.7s)]
*  I'm sure it'd be cool. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1351.94s)]
*  Didn't they use Summer League there? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1352.58s)]
*  Not in the sphere. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1353.94s)]
*  I'm like, they do it in Vegas. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1354.6599999999999s)]
*  I know they made the sphere a basketball, so I thought maybe they had Summer League there. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1356.58s)]
*  Yeah, no, they were just doing that. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1359.3s)]
*  That's the thing, basketball is like more constant, I feel like. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1359.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1362.02s)]
*  You would just have like halftime and timeouts and shit? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1362.42s)]
*  Like quarters? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1364.58s)]
*  I don't even think we're, I think the tech is so new, we can't even conceptualize. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1365.3799999999999s)]
*  How to do it correctly. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1370.18s)]
*  What it could be. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1370.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1371.46s)]
*  Like we're like scratching the surface. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1372.18s)]
*  Like right now we're like, okay, let's put these amazing videos on in this immersive environment. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1373.54s)]
*  That's like step one. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1378.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1379.78s)]
*  In 1998, you didn't know you could make your entire career on the internet. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1380.42s)]
*  You just thought like, oh yeah, this is where you go look at porn and download music. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1383.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's for sure. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1386.6599999999999s)]
*  And now it's like, oh, this is everything. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1387.46s)]
*  I would just go see an old concert. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1388.8999999999999s)]
*  I would just go see Michael Jackson in Berlin. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1390.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1392.98s)]
*  Like from like the fucking 90s on in the sphere. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1393.7s)]
*  I'd be bonkers. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1397.06s)]
*  Yeah, like just put on every great concert ever just in the sphere. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1398.02s)]
*  Pink Floyd? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1401.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1402.4199999999998s)]
*  Like you play the wall in the sphere. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1402.8999999999999s)]
*  The trick, and I think you could probably use AI to do it, but the tricky thing is the quality [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1404.1s)]
*  of video you need needs to be so high to wrap it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1408.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm hoping that like the Wizard of Oz shit that they're doing, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1412.02s)]
*  like hopefully they can map that to. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1414.58s)]
*  This is the original Wizard of Oz movie. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1416.26s)]
*  I think so. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1418.02s)]
*  Because they got the Oz or the, what's the one, the new one coming out, Wicked? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1419.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1422.58s)]
*  They have the old film negatives. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1422.8999999999999s)]
*  Like film is really not, it's not 14K, but it's usually four or five K. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1424.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1428.82s)]
*  Original film. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1429.1399999999999s)]
*  So certain movies might work quicker. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1430.02s)]
*  I love that they're leaning into the drug element. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1431.78s)]
*  They're like, all right, we're going to put Grateful Dead, we're putting Wizard of Oz. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1434.1s)]
*  It's all like these psychedelic like calling cards. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1437.3s)]
*  And I think that works. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1439.86s)]
*  Anyway, a lot of people put money on this event, including Sugar Sean. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1441.06s)]
*  He had a nice little parlay going. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1445.3s)]
*  He lost that parlay because he lost. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1446.5s)]
*  So just to add insult to injury, that is a big bummer. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1449.54s)]
*  Shout out to Sugar Sean. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1452.82s)]
*  He's going to take some time off. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1453.94s)]
*  You should. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1455.22s)]
*  Needed. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1455.78s)]
*  You deserve it. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1456.5s)]
*  You made tons of money. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1457.3799999999999s)]
*  You don't have to fight another day in your life if you don't want to. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1458.34s)]
*  You already achieved your dream. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1460.34s)]
*  Everything is there. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1461.46s)]
*  It's locked in. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1462.3400000000001s)]
*  Who cares about anything else? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1463.6200000000001s)]
*  If you do want to come back, hopefully you come back healthy. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1465.54s)]
*  But shout out Steak, man. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1468.42s)]
*  Because Steak is allowing you to feel even worse after a loss. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1470.58s)]
*  And that is why we support Steak so much. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1477.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1480.98s)]
*  We don't want him to have like a little victory on the side of his loss. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1481.7s)]
*  Like what if he wasn't included in the parlay? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1485.8600000000001s)]
*  We're not helping you as a person. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1488.66s)]
*  We're helping you grow by making money. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1489.8600000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1490.98s)]
*  The next time, you are going to double down. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1492.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1494.26s)]
*  He'll come back better. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1494.58s)]
*  He'll train harder. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1495.46s)]
*  He'll never forget this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1496.34s)]
*  You'll never forget. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1497.7s)]
*  It's going to be that little chip on his shoulder. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1498.9s)]
*  He's going to come back there. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1500.5s)]
*  He's going to fight Marab again. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1501.6200000000001s)]
*  He's going to beat this time. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1502.98s)]
*  He's going to do an eight fight parlay. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1504.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1508.02s)]
*  Mix it with different sports. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1508.66s)]
*  I want you to let it rip, Sugar. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1509.78s)]
*  Shout out to Steak. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1512.02s)]
*  By the way, this segment has been brought to you by Steak, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1512.82s)]
*  the leader in global betting in US social casinos, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1515.14s)]
*  bet on top sports, political events, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1517.7s)]
*  and use the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1519.3s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1522.4199999999998s)]
*  Who is a DJ that's big enough to hold that space? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1523.62s)]
*  I mean like Tiësto or whatever. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1527.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1529.7s)]
*  Tiësto or some shit. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1530.18s)]
*  I'm trying to think like- [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1531.3s)]
*  Black Coffee. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1532.5s)]
*  No one has been doing the visuals that Anima and Tale of Us have been doing. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1534.26s)]
*  Yeah, Tale of Us would probably be the craziest. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1537.3s)]
*  But Tale of Us is sold? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1538.82s)]
*  Well, Tale of Us, half of Tale of Us is a guy, Anima, and he's kind of gone solo. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1540.26s)]
*  He's the one who also just did the visual. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1544.26s)]
*  Did you see the Weekend show in Sao Paulo? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1545.78s)]
*  Is he the guy with the giant robot? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1548.66s)]
*  The Weekend? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1550.1000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1550.98s)]
*  Travis Scott. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1551.7s)]
*  Travis Scott. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1552.8200000000002s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1554.26s)]
*  That would be crazy. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1555.5400000000002s)]
*  But I don't think there's another DJ to sell it out six times like Anima just did right now. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1556.9s)]
*  So here's the thing that I will say is that like four acts that are going in there, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1561.38s)]
*  let's say a Travis or let's say the Weekend that goes in there, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1566.5s)]
*  there's going to be some novelty for the first few acts that go in. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1570.5s)]
*  So even if you're an act that maybe you could do like four shows there normally, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1575.22s)]
*  you'll do eight simply because people are going to go, I need to see the first concert. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1580.82s)]
*  I wonder if the multiplier is more. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1585.06s)]
*  It could be. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1586.5s)]
*  I wonder if it's like three. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1586.9s)]
*  It could be. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1588.02s)]
*  And Travis Scott does Stadium, so if he's doing 80,000, 20,000 at the Sphere, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1589.46s)]
*  it's like I got to do four times the shows just off of that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1593.14s)]
*  Yeah, the Weekend might be crazy. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be nuts. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1597.14s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1598.9s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to get lost. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1601.94s)]
*  I really want to go see another thing there. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1603.06s)]
*  So yeah, this is pretty fucking cool. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1605.22s)]
*  So we'll go back. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1607.8600000000001s)]
*  So I'll get a chance. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1608.66s)]
*  Nope. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1609.46s)]
*  Come on. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1609.94s)]
*  No, come on. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1610.42s)]
*  We're all going to go. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1610.98s)]
*  Nope, nope, nope. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1611.78s)]
*  Pass is a pass. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1612.82s)]
*  No. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1613.94s)]
*  No, boy. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1614.58s)]
*  Really fun. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1615.38s)]
*  Anyway, this Weekend, Akash was in Florida and Trump got shot. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1616.34s)]
*  So what do you think about that? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1619.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1621.06s)]
*  Do you have an alibi? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1621.54s)]
*  I'm trying to help this man win an election. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1622.98s)]
*  Y'all ain't trying to do that? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1625.7s)]
*  Let's take the focus off the debate, guys. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1627.6200000000001s)]
*  That was my idea. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1630.34s)]
*  Y'all don't care about Trump, none. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1631.46s)]
*  So you knew about this plot to shoot the president? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1632.74s)]
*  I masterminded it, dude. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1635.94s)]
*  I'm the guy. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1637.22s)]
*  But you didn't do a good job, bro. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1637.86s)]
*  It was your idea. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1638.9s)]
*  Yeah, why didn't you bring it up? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1640.1s)]
*  That's true. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1641.22s)]
*  I actually stole your bit, to be honest with you. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1642.02s)]
*  I apologize for stealing your... [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1643.86s)]
*  You said Trump got to get shot again after that debate, after we talked about whatever. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1645.38s)]
*  I honestly thought it would be more impactful. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1648.02s)]
*  Because there was no shots fired. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1650.66s)]
*  There was no shots fired. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1651.54s)]
*  He was just there. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1652.5s)]
*  And he's like some kooky guy. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1653.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1654.98s)]
*  He basically is a stalker. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1655.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1656.66s)]
*  I mean, it's not that he's worthy. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1657.3s)]
*  This guy's a warrior, dude. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1658.82s)]
*  He's a Ukrainian soldier, all right? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1659.78s)]
*  Put some respect on him. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1662.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's fighting the man, dude. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1663.0600000000002s)]
*  He's fighting for freedom. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1664.18s)]
*  Go back over there, buddy. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1664.98s)]
*  And we still need you. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1667.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pretty wild thing, though. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1668.42s)]
*  It's strange. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1669.6200000000001s)]
*  The guy was involved with this debatable organization in Ukraine. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1670.74s)]
*  Apparently, he never really fought. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1677.38s)]
*  He was just there, hanging, putting up posters and shit. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1678.74s)]
*  He was living in Hawaii. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1681.78s)]
*  No one really knows what his job was. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1682.66s)]
*  Has a ton of crazy criminal history. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1683.94s)]
*  And then ran away and then actually got captured. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1687.8600000000001s)]
*  So he's alive. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1690.5s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to find out. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1691.94s)]
*  My assumption is just like a crazy guy. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1692.74s)]
*  And what happens is when there's one assassination attempt, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1694.8200000000002s)]
*  I think there's copycats. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1698.5s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1699.8600000000001s)]
*  And now that there's two, there'll be more crazy people out there. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1700.5s)]
*  Any better security, though. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1703.8600000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1705.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1706.0200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1706.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, but how do you secure an entire golf course? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1707.0600000000002s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1711.46s)]
*  It technically worked. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1712.18s)]
*  They were on the fifth hole going to the sixth, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1713.46s)]
*  and they were ahead of there, and they saw a gun. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1715.0600000000002s)]
*  Like, just killed. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1716.98s)]
*  Yeah, but he was there for like 12 hours camping out, apparently. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1720.3400000000001s)]
*  That's on my own. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1721.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1722.02s)]
*  That's not a great look. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1722.3400000000001s)]
*  They got to do better. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1723.94s)]
*  Yeah, higher extra security for both candidates. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1724.66s)]
*  Either one of them gets shot. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1727.38s)]
*  This whole thing is going to be a big fucking nightmare. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1729.6200000000001s)]
*  So let's just protect both of them. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1732.18s)]
*  It already is a nightmare. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1733.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1734.8200000000002s)]
*  But imagine it actually happens? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1735.5400000000002s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1737.5400000000002s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1738.3400000000001s)]
*  Did you see that his first Twitter follow and follow back [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1738.98s)]
*  was like some former CIA lady? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1742.98s)]
*  I don't know how true that is, but yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1744.74s)]
*  They're saying it's like probably his handler or something like that [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1747.0600000000002s)]
*  before they wiped his social media. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1749.3s)]
*  Oh, did they wipe it? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1751.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1752.74s)]
*  When FBI catches somebody, they take down all their social media. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1753.22s)]
*  It was up for mad long. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1756.34s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1757.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1758.02s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1758.58s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1759.22s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be all these great conspiracies that come out from it. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1759.78s)]
*  People are claiming that he was in a BlackRock commercial that went around everywhere. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1764.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1767.3s)]
*  He wasn't in the BlackRock commercial. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1768.82s)]
*  It was he did the stuff for Ukraine. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1770.5s)]
*  And BlackRock, I think it would be the greatest beneficiary [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1774.5s)]
*  if Ukraine is able to maintain their freedom. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1778.18s)]
*  So I think they're going, well, the first shooter was in a BlackRock commercial. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1782.42s)]
*  The second one is pro-Ukraine. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1786.42s)]
*  Is part of this Ukraine thing that BlackRock benefits from. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1788.5s)]
*  Therefore, it must be. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1791.7s)]
*  But also when you're BlackRock and you own everything, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1793.46s)]
*  it's very easy to end up in some sort of like as part of their web. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1796.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1800.98s)]
*  I haven't seen any connection that they funded this or in any way did it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1801.38s)]
*  No, no, they didn't. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1805.94s)]
*  What I'm saying is they would be the biggest beneficiary if Ukraine gets its sovereignty. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1807.06s)]
*  People are claiming that he's in a BlackRock commercial. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1811.78s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1813.6200000000001s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1814.74s)]
*  Do you think they're trying to take him out because Trump keeps saying he's going to put an end to all these wars? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1824.02s)]
*  There's a fun theory. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1824.58s)]
*  I think that's where you want to go. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1825.8600000000001s)]
*  But I understand how the internet goes in that direction. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1827.3s)]
*  Once you just become so radicalized based on true shit, it's very easy to believe not true shit. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1830.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1836.82s)]
*  It was so funny just to even see the reaction to last week's rant. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1840.02s)]
*  When we did the rant, I felt fair about how the debate went. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1843.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1847.7s)]
*  To see all these fucking crybabies in the comments like, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1848.98s)]
*  no, like Schultz, you're a paid shill. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1852.6599999999999s)]
*  The Democrats are paying for you. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1855.78s)]
*  You used to be funny, but now you're not. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1857.46s)]
*  It's like, oh, I used to be funny when you agreed with my opinions. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1859.7s)]
*  And now that you don't, now it's not funny. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1863.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1865.78s)]
*  Or now that... [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1866.1s)]
*  Now that you're not my shill. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1867.2199999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1869.06s)]
*  You're not funny. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1869.3799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1870.02s)]
*  And it's just like how soft people are. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1870.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1875.06s)]
*  And both sides do this. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1875.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1876.4199999999998s)]
*  They're both snowflakes. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1877.54s)]
*  You're both snowflakes. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1878.8999999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable snowflakes. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1879.4599999999998s)]
*  But how much? How much do they pay? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1880.98s)]
*  I got $1,200 for that one. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1883.2199999999998s)]
*  You got tickets to the spheres. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1883.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1884.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1885.06s)]
*  Tickets to the spheres. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1885.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1885.78s)]

*  They introduce them to Shaq. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1886.58s)]
*  Because that was worth it. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1887.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1888.58s)]
*  100%. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1888.8999999999999s)]

*  But it just sucks because all these people talk about how they want an honest and [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1890.5s)]

*  It's like, no, you don't. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1896.5s)]
*  None of you want it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1897.46s)]
*  You want to be told whatever you feel is right. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1898.34s)]
*  You want to be patted on your fucking back. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1900.1s)]
*  You want to be put on the tit and then put to sleep. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1902.02s)]
*  That's all you fucking want. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1904.4199999999998s)]
*  You want to be pacified. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1905.54s)]
*  And yeah, it's just... [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1907.22s)]
*  It's a little demoralizing to be honest with you. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1910.1s)]
*  That sucks. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1912.5s)]
*  When you're trying to be fair and down the middle and it's like, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1913.1399999999999s)]
*  you get scrutinized for it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1915.86s)]
*  And then it's one of those things where it's like, well, that's why no one's fair. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1917.1399999999999s)]
*  Because there's no money in fair. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1921.06s)]
*  That's the old quote, dude. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1922.1799999999998s)]
*  The only thing in the middle of the road is roadkill. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1923.38s)]
*  That's... [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1926.3400000000001s)]
*  That's bars. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1926.8200000000002s)]
*  But that is true. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1928.18s)]
*  It's like, of course CNN is going to go left because there's a bunch of motherfuckers that [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1928.98s)]
*  need their feelings nurtured. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1932.74s)]

*  There isn't anything in the middle because there's not enough people in the middle that [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1937.46s)]
*  need to be nurtured. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1940.74s)]
*  That's why I was actually thinking about Breaking Points and how they have a subscriber [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1941.8600000000001s)]

*  I don't have anything that way. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1949.94s)]
*  I don't have to just appease sponsors and sell commercials. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1951.22s)]
*  Y'all pay for us. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1953.8600000000001s)]

*  Pay for it if you want actual independent... [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1959.94s)]
*  What happens when the subscribers go down? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1961.6200000000001s)]
*  Time to switch up. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1965.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's there. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1965.94s)]
*  I guess that's there as well. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1967.7s)]
*  But if you get the subscribers based on being moderate, then that's what's going to keep... [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1968.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, everybody's moderate until it comes to the thing you're passionate about. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1972.0200000000002s)]
*  It's kind of like listening to your girl complain. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1974.5800000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1976.18s)]
*  Like you ever try to be nuanced when she's like venting about some shit? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1976.66s)]
*  You're like, well, you know, I can see both sides. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1979.3000000000002s)]

*  Yeah, you got a grift with your girl. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1984.18s)]
*  You got a grift with your girl. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1985.94s)]
*  Big time grift. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1987.14s)]
*  You're like, oh, why would they do that to you? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1987.86s)]
*  That's so fucked up. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1989.54s)]
*  And then they're like, yeah, right? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1990.98s)]
*  You're like, I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1992.26s)]
*  But no, you're right. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1995.54s)]
*  It is a tricky situation. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=1996.34s)]
*  It is a... [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2000.1s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2000.74s)]
*  Say again? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2003.06s)]
*  I figured out how to bring people to the center. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2003.54s)]
*  I texted Mark this dumb idea recently, but I think it's actually a good idea. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2005.94s)]
*  Well, you have to learn first. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2009.22s)]
*  What? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2010.5s)]
*  I said, you have to learn first. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2010.82s)]
*  No, this is how you're getting brought back in. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2012.02s)]
*  Back in the day, if you lost, if you were second place in the presidential race, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2014.58s)]
*  you then became the first person's vice president. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2018.4199999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2020.82s)]
*  I think we go back to that because then both sides have to put up people who are going to [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2021.3799999999999s)]
*  sort of agree with each other and could win the most amount of votes. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2026.1799999999998s)]
*  So now you sort of got two people who are somewhat similar. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2029.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, why'd they stop that? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2032.82s)]
*  I imagine nothing gets done or like you're like, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2035.62s)]
*  this guy is going to try to get me assassinated. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2038.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2040.8999999999999s)]
*  And then he's vice president. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2041.3799999999999s)]
*  The whole party now has a vested interest in killing me. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2042.5s)]
*  Shout out to LBJ, dude. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2044.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2045.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why they stopped it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2048.18s)]
*  But kind of in my mind as a mild sex man, I was like, count fire. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2049.62s)]
*  I mean, didn't... [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2052.98s)]
*  It's a great theory. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2053.54s)]
*  Who did Hamilton help get elected? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2054.58s)]
*  Because it was like Aaron Burr versus another dude. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2059.46s)]
*  It was Jefferson. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2064.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2065.2999999999997s)]
*  And then Jefferson decided not to have Burr as his vice, I'm pretty sure. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2066.66s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2072.8999999999996s)]
*  Not exactly sure, but I would fact check that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2074.2599999999998s)]
*  So he might have been the one that kind of bucked that trend. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2077.06s)]
*  But yeah, that seems way better. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2079.54s)]
*  But still, people are going to be radicalized and now with the internet, it's just so easy to do it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2081.8599999999997s)]
*  And yeah, now both sides are saying if this person wins, the country's at stake. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2085.62s)]
*  It's a crisis. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2089.62s)]
*  This is going to be a problem. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2090.98s)]
*  You saw Trump do that? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2091.9399999999996s)]
*  Democracy's over. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2092.5s)]
*  They all do that. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2093.7s)]
*  Trump tweeted every person that ever said that he was a threat to democracy. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2094.7400000000002s)]
*  He put it on True Social. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2098.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2099.78s)]
*  And he had a laundry list of four pages. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2100.1800000000003s)]
*  He's like, this person said this shit to me, this person said this shit about me, called everyone out. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2102.34s)]
*  I mean, good. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2106.6600000000003s)]
*  We didn't make the list. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2107.3s)]
*  Nothing we said that the fake shooting thing, nothing came up. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2108.98s)]
*  But he was calling out every politician. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2113.6200000000003s)]
*  He was like, yeah. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2115.1400000000003s)]
*  And he's like, you're responsible for this, essentially? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2115.7000000000003s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2118.6600000000003s)]
*  Shit, once you get shot at or people trying to kill you, you can say whatever the fuck you want about it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2119.3s)]
*  And he blamed Taylor Swift. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2122.6600000000003s)]
*  The Taylor Swift thing was peculiar why he would double down on that. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2124.58s)]
*  I hate Taylor Swift. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2127.54s)]
*  It's the funniest thing to ever say. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2128.98s)]
*  Oh, was he there? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2132.1000000000004s)]
*  No, he didn't pull up. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2133.38s)]
*  That's surprising because he was in Vegas. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2134.5s)]
*  I think he was there if he chose not to come, which is very interesting. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2136.5s)]
*  And the attempt was Sunday, right? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2140.7400000000002s)]
*  The assassination attempt was Sunday? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2143.46s)]
*  Must have been. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2145.06s)]
*  It was after the sphere, right? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2145.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2146.6600000000003s)]
*  But I know he was in Vegas that day. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2147.1400000000003s)]

*  Or was he just in Vegas Friday and then he left? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2149.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he probably left after. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2151.9399999999996s)]
*  He was definitely there Friday. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2154.02s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2154.98s)]
*  So he chose to leave. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2155.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2156.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2157.24s)]
*  Chose to leave. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2158.3399999999997s)]
*  Dana, she was a lot of love in that room. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2158.98s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2162.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2162.98s)]
*  Actually, because he came for Rogan. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2163.7799999999997s)]
*  He came for Rogan. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2165.7799999999997s)]
*  The room would have had the truth. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2167.3799999999997s)]
*  Interesting. Maybe that's why he skipped out. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2168.2599999999998s)]
*  Came for Rogan and it's Mexican independence weekend. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2170.5s)]
*  Now Mexicans do fuck with Trump, but there might also be a contingent of Mexicans that [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2177.06s)]
*  are like, fuck this guy. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2180.74s)]
*  You talk wild shit about immigrants. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2182.3399999999997s)]
*  Our families are immigrants. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2184.02s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2186.3399999999997s)]
*  So it is a little bit dicey. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2187.06s)]
*  And the last thing he probably needs right now is getting booed at a UFC event. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2188.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2194.3399999999997s)]

*  So yeah. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2199.54s)]
*  I mean, this was good for his PR, realistically. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2202.02s)]
*  What was? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2205.2999999999997s)]
*  Kill a story with a story. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2205.9399999999996s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2233.22s)]
*  Trump's people need to figure out something because he got no energy right now. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2237.14s)]
*  He's got a new crypto dropping. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2241.86s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2243.3s)]
*  Who's advising Trump right now? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2245.86s)]
*  Trump NFTs made money. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2249.22s)]
*  Also, I still would buy one. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2250.98s)]

*  Those kids were fired. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2255.38s)]

*  Stop it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2257.54s)]

*  It really is pathetic. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2265.46s)]

*  Yeah, a couple million. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2273.78s)]
*  Is it million? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2276.18s)]
*  I would love for Trump to do an ad read during a debate. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2277.46s)]
*  That would be fire. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2280.1s)]

*  As he's holding the prime cam. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2290.82s)]
*  Make some money. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2292.98s)]
*  We won't see any more debates. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2293.78s)]

*  So is that true? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2296.1s)]
*  He posted on Truth Social. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2297.7s)]
*  He's not doing any more debates. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2298.74s)]

*  Apparently to him, he won. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2301.3799999999997s)]
*  Best case for comma, I think. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2303.14s)]

*  Oh, it's toast. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2314.66s)]

*  It's pretty easy. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2316.2599999999998s)]
*  Easily. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2317.7s)]
*  In one sentence, that's all it took. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2318.66s)]
*  They know exactly what to do to rile him up. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2320.58s)]
*  I don't know if Trump's handlers or the people that he trusts, the people who are advising him. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2322.98s)]

*  So they know that Kamala got the kryptonite. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2332.18s)]
*  So they're like, we can't put him in this situation again because I don't know if he [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2335.7s)]
*  can handle himself here. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2339.46s)]
*  He's got nothing on her. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2341.3s)]
*  She's got really no track record. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2342.66s)]
*  She's almost like she's got the Obama thing going, which is like she hasn't really been [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2345.46s)]
*  in politics long enough to have a lot of fuck ups. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2350.1s)]
*  Remember, Obama was very, very junior. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2353.86s)]
*  So he didn't really vote on that many bills. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2357.86s)]
*  There wasn't a lot to hold him against a fire to. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2362.02s)]
*  Whereas like an Elizabeth Warren or a Nancy Pelosi, they probably had 30 fuck ups throughout [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2364.26s)]
*  their career that you could just go, well, you voted for this bill. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2369.54s)]
*  Now you're saying this. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2372.1s)]
*  Yeah, I thought Kamala had been a politician for a while. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2373.14s)]
*  No, she was like she was a district attorney and then she was a senator. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2376.02s)]
*  But it was very brief. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2381.62s)]
*  Yeah, not that long. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2383.14s)]
*  But I mean, he can hold her to the fire for the past three and a half years. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2384.58s)]
*  And just keep him on that. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2388.5s)]
*  Strategically, he could do better. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2391.54s)]
*  Yes, he could go back in if he can handle it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2392.98s)]
*  And he could actually. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2395.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think his people think he can handle it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2396.5s)]
*  I don't think he could. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2398.18s)]
*  She got under his skin so easily. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2400.5s)]
*  I mean, as we're talking this out, it was one sentence and it's over. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2401.94s)]
*  I think the Obama thing actually influenced that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2406.9s)]
*  I have no proof for this, but like she says, I think he doesn't like Kamala. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2409.46s)]
*  I think he hates Obama. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2414.7400000000002s)]
*  He was doing the birther shit from 2010. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2416.7400000000002s)]
*  Like, yo, this guy's not even from here. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2418.82s)]
*  He hates Obama. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2420.26s)]
*  And then Obama at the DNC makes the joke about, yeah, we're talking about crowd sizes. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2421.38s)]
*  What's his concern with crowd sizes? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2425.3s)]
*  Yeah, just a great joke and like perfect delivery. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2426.7400000000002s)]
*  Like fucking crush. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2428.9s)]
*  He's a fucking man. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2429.78s)]
*  He is. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2430.66s)]
*  But I think that and then Kamala basically like echoed that same sentiment. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2431.86s)]
*  And I think he low key was like, oh, these motherfuckers. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2436.8199999999997s)]
*  I bet you he was watching the Obama thing being like, I hate this guy. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2439.62s)]
*  And then she says the same thing. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2443.06s)]
*  Set him off. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2444.2599999999998s)]

*  Inside joke. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2981.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2982.5s)]
*  Maybe he's been hating Trump and he was like... [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2982.98s)]
*  He's a sleeper cell. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2984.5s)]
*  He's a spy. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2985.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2986.26s)]
*  Feeding them all the bullshit that we then criticize Trump for. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2987.2200000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2990.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2990.6600000000003s)]
*  They might have to yank that dude. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2991.3s)]
*  I also think that like the... [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2994.7400000000002s)]
*  The meme era of like promoting like political ideology is starting to wane. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=2996.34s)]
*  Like I think it was... [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3004.9s)]
*  You mean by meme era? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3005.46s)]
*  Like early Trump was... [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3007.06s)]
*  There were so many... [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3008.6600000000003s)]
*  The memes were so important. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3009.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3011.86s)]
*  And build the wall, that kind of stuff? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3012.1800000000003s)]
*  All the things that would come out of it. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3013.7000000000003s)]
*  And like there would be all these memes that would like condense the information in a funny [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3015.06s)]
*  way that would like project the ideology. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3018.02s)]
*  And this is when memes are getting popular and it's a really fun thing to share with one another. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3019.86s)]
*  And I'm not saying that we don't still do that. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3024.26s)]
*  But it's not as novel. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3026.5s)]
*  It's a little bit more redundant. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3028.58s)]
*  It's a little bit more like tired. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3030.02s)]
*  You know? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3031.94s)]
*  And so I think they're trying to like win the meme war. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3032.7400000000002s)]
*  But memes in general are just kind of done. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3036.1000000000004s)]
*  Like I'll talk to Shifty and like Shifty will tell me about the way his generation approaches [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3038.5s)]
*  memes. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3042.98s)]
*  They're like jokes on jokes on jokes on jokes to the point where like the average person [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3043.3s)]
*  doesn't even understand it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3047.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3049.06s)]
*  And I think it's because... [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3049.38s)]
*  And you correct me if I'm wrong here Shifty. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3050.98s)]
*  But like the initial version of the meme is now so commonplace that it no longer elicits [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3052.74s)]
*  the reaction it used to. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3059.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3060.18s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3060.58s)]
*  So now you're just doing like inside joke on inside. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3061.62s)]
*  And then the only place that the first meme can go is just to the people that it's all... [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3065.46s)]
*  They just want to hear their like feelings echoed. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3072.8199999999997s)]
*  The Democrats did this with like the dark Brandon thing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3075.14s)]
*  What is that? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3077.54s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3077.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3078.6600000000003s)]
*  I remember this. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3078.7400000000002s)]
*  Where like Biden like put on his sunglasses and he was like, I'm dark Brandon. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3078.9s)]
*  And then it was just like... [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3083.38s)]
*  They tried to make it like a... [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3084.42s)]
*  Gay. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3085.7000000000003s)]
*  And I feel like the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign are trying to chase this and [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3086.34s)]
*  it's lost its authenticity. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3091.7000000000003s)]
*  It's lost its like purity. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3093.3s)]
*  This is what happens when corporations try to take on any... [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3094.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like a big corporation buying a cool streetwear brand. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3100.26s)]
*  That's what it feels like a little bit. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3105.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3106.5800000000004s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3107.3s)]
*  Oh, this is how you get shit done? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3107.38s)]
*  Okay, let's try it. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3108.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3109.78s)]
*  Like when Supreme started partnering with everybody, you could feel it being like, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3110.02s)]
*  oh, this is not gonna last. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3112.7400000000002s)]
*  It's lost its cool. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3113.94s)]
*  It lost its lost. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3114.82s)]
*  Like what is cool about it is that it's authentic and it's lost its authenticity. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3116.1800000000003s)]
*  And yeah, just there needs to be a new energy. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3120.5s)]
*  One thing I saw all last week was they made a song from that eating the dogs. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3124.42s)]
*  It was like they eat the dog, they eat the cat. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3128.82s)]
*  That went crazy. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3130.98s)]
*  Eat the cat. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3131.78s)]
*  That shit was fire. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3132.5s)]
*  High fire. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3134.1s)]
*  It's like, I wish they didn't... [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3135.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm sure their side wishes it was for a better reason, but the song was fire. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3136.66s)]
*  I mean, it was fire. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3140.58s)]
*  If it penetrates culture, it penetrates culture. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3141.2999999999997s)]
*  That is true. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3142.74s)]
*  Also, the other thing that's so funny is like, people are trying to defend that line so much [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3143.22s)]
*  that they're like going to the ends of the internet to find any moment where a person [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3147.2999999999997s)]
*  is eating a house pet to justify the statement. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3152.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3156.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3156.74s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3156.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3157.94s)]
*  Where it's just like, yeah, it's happened. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3158.2599999999998s)]
*  It's probably happened. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3159.54s)]
*  Is it happening nonstop in Springfield, Ohio? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3160.42s)]
*  Is it a cultural thing? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3162.58s)]
*  No. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3163.94s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3164.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3165.14s)]
*  But there's a perfect example of another thing that happened last week. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3165.94s)]
*  So there was that excerpt from the pod where we were... [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3171.38s)]
*  I think we were talking about... [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3174.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know the exact clip, but I think we were talking about the Haitian thing with [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3175.86s)]
*  like, we have to teach them not to eat the pets. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3178.7400000000002s)]
*  And then I was like, we have to do this with the immigrants in Europe too. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3180.42s)]
*  We have to teach the Muslims not to... [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3183.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3185.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3185.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3185.86s)]
*  And it's just so funny. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3186.34s)]
*  I... [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3190.1800000000003s)]
*  When it happens, I can't help but laugh because like, I can tell when people that [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3190.58s)]
*  are upset about something don't listen to our pod. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3198.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3201.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3201.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3202.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3202.34s)]
*  Because... [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3202.9s)]
*  But what's so funny is that what they do is they try to scare you by saying, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3203.46s)]
*  I'm boycotting your podcast. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3207.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3209.2200000000003s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3210.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like, you didn't even listen to that clip. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3210.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3212.6600000000003s)]
*  Back when... [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3212.98s)]
*  You don't even know what the context of the conversation was. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3213.38s)]
*  Back when getting canceled had like some weight to it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3216.7400000000002s)]
*  I was always like, you were never subscribed to the person you're canceling. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3219.1400000000003s)]
*  What are you canceling? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3222.1000000000004s)]
*  None of these people listen to your shit. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3222.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3224.1800000000003s)]
*  There are people that... [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3224.5s)]
*  It's very unfortunate. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3225.3s)]
*  They feel powerless in their lives and they're trying to exert their power on people [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3226.26s)]
*  through cancellation. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3230.1800000000003s)]
*  And I imagine that that is very seductive when you do feel powerless. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3231.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=3236.82s)]

*  I don't think that you're capable of protecting yourself, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4123.86s)]

*  That's true. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4139.38s)]

*  I do bite my feet. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4161.46s)]
*  I just want to say that is not a Scottish thing, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4162.66s)]

*  Now as far as the sanitary... [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4168.34s)]
*  You're eating your own body. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4170.18s)]
*  That's kind of a Haitian thing. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4171.22s)]
*  Mark, can we take this seriously? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4175.7s)]

*  Haitians, I'm sorry. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4183.38s)]
*  And it is definitely not cool to be in that situation. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4184.42s)]
*  And again, not be the ones to stand up and keep the cameras down. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4190.34s)]
*  And we fucked it on that occasion. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4194.58s)]
*  It's not going to happen again. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4197.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's about being human. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4199.54s)]
*  It's about realizing that you don't know what you're prepared for. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4200.9800000000005s)]
*  You don't know how to prepare for something [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4203.86s)]
*  that you don't know what's going to happen. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4205.62s)]
*  Once it's happened one time, you're like, fuck. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4207.22s)]
*  You know what's mad funny about this? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4209.62s)]
*  Is that they had shit that they asked to take out the episode. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4211.0599999999995s)]
*  You know what they didn't ask to take out? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4214.5s)]
*  Your racist slander? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4218.58s)]
*  Why's your nose twitching? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4222.5s)]
*  They had shit. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4226.099999999999s)]
*  Their producer or whatever was like, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4227.78s)]
*  hey, we really think that's inappropriate. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4229.0599999999995s)]
*  We'd like to take that out. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4230.9s)]
*  That's very... [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4232.419999999999s)]
*  Their fight and flight instinct really kicked in after the pilot down. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4233.139999999999s)]
*  But with that joke about the black woman, nothing. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4236.259999999999s)]
*  Nothing really seemed... [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4238.82s)]
*  The fight or flight wasn't really there. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4239.78s)]
*  Your deliver was too good. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4241.86s)]
*  Maybe they were seduced by a delivery. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4243.0599999999995s)]
*  I feel bad they're going through this, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4246.259999999999s)]
*  but you don't got to protect anybody. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4247.38s)]
*  That's what I would say to y'all personally, to y'all publicly. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4249.139999999999s)]

*  That's true. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4259.94s)]
*  That's literally it, bro. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4260.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we fucked it and we're sorry. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4262.179999999999s)]
*  We apologize. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4264.339999999999s)]
*  You definitely don't apologize. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4264.9s)]
*  For me, it's one of them ones where you don't realize that, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4266.660000000001s)]
*  for one, when you're part of a community, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4273.860000000001s)]
*  you don't realize that you can hurt your own community. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4276.580000000001s)]
*  Unintentionally. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4281.540000000001s)]
*  Unintentionally, for real. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4282.18s)]
*  And also on top of that, it was so crazy that the narrative [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4282.9800000000005s)]
*  that's been spun about how we feel about our community, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4288.02s)]
*  the irony of the fact that whilst the whole reason we're in that country, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4291.540000000001s)]
*  was to just show how much we love our community [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4296.0199999999995s)]
*  and how much we love our supporters [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4298.339999999999s)]
*  and how much time we spent at the shows [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4300.099999999999s)]
*  and just getting to know people [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4302.66s)]
*  and just understanding our community better [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4304.5s)]
*  and just making friends and making bonds [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4306.74s)]
*  and showing love and they're showing love. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4308.419999999999s)]
*  And this whole six-week trip was just about showing [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4309.86s)]
*  how much we love our community [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4312.74s)]
*  and how much our community show up for us. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4313.94s)]
*  And then to have that exact same trip be the reason [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4316.179999999999s)]
*  that we're having to have this conversation now. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4320.099999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, mistakes make you a better person. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4322.9800000000005s)]
*  Mistakes do make you a better person. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4328.58s)]
*  You're not born a perfect person. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4330.02s)]
*  And yeah, we don't condone, we don't appease that behavior. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4332.1s)]
*  All right, all right, we get it. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4336.34s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4338.74s)]
*  Listen, I do have empathy for what they're going through. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4339.38s)]
*  They're young into this content game. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4341.46s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4343.22s)]
*  And this is what happens with a lot of people who are like, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4343.9400000000005s)]
*  funny on the internet, but they're not comedians. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4346.820000000001s)]
*  So they are still concerned about cancellation. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4350.820000000001s)]
*  I think comedians, we understand that being funny [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4357.14s)]
*  is saying inappropriate things. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4360.26s)]
*  Sometimes that thing that's inappropriate [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4361.9400000000005s)]
*  is something about you. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4363.54s)]
*  Sometimes it's about other people. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4364.820000000001s)]
*  But the nature of being funny [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4366.820000000001s)]
*  is something inappropriate happening. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4369.22s)]
*  And I think what they're doing, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4372.5s)]
*  what they don't realize is because they're young in the game, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4375.38s)]
*  and we've all went through this. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4377.14s)]
*  It's like scary in the beginning. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4378.18s)]
*  You really think you're going to be canceled. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4379.46s)]
*  You're worried. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4380.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm sure that they have people that they have to take care of. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4381.54s)]
*  And they're like, oh, what if I have to go back [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4384.1s)]
*  and I have to get a regular job? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4385.94s)]
*  Is it all over? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4387.14s)]
*  I completely have empathy for them. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4388.02s)]
*  I get that. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4389.94s)]
*  What they don't realize is by apologizing, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4390.34s)]
*  you're just amplifying it. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4394.02s)]
*  The people that are upset at this, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4395.62s)]
*  the majority of them don't even listen to the podcast. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4396.82s)]
*  A lot of them are probably resentful of your success. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4399.14s)]
*  And they're like, why the fuck should these guys [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4401.86s)]
*  make all this money? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4404.42s)]
*  And they're just reacting to stupid videos on the internet [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4405.06s)]
*  and telling stories from college. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4407.7s)]
*  I'm just friends. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4409.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just friends. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4409.860000000001s)]
*  Why can't I have millions of dollars like they have? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4410.580000000001s)]
*  But they don't realize that. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4413.06s)]
*  They really think it's their community. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4414.02s)]
*  Your community still loves you. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4415.54s)]
*  Your community still knows you. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4416.42s)]
*  And if you actually have a community, like you say, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4417.700000000001s)]
*  which I do believe you do, they're not going to immediately [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4420.5s)]
*  throw you away because of one clip where you're laughing [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4423.54s)]
*  at a clear fucking joke. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4426.5s)]
*  I was at the live show. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4428.26s)]
*  They're not going anywhere. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4429.780000000001s)]
*  Your fans fucking love you. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4430.900000000001s)]
*  You said the live show was amazing. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4432.18s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4433.22s)]
*  And your fans fucking love you. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4433.700000000001s)]
*  They're not going anywhere. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4435.22s)]
*  But what you have done, and this is hopefully the learning [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  moment, is that you have empowered those people that [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4438.34s)]
*  are trying to cancel you. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4440.82s)]
*  Remember, the people trying to cancel you get off on you [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4441.7s)]
*  being canceled. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4444.5s)]
*  You having to come out and apologize and bend to their whim [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4445.3s)]
*  and change the disposition of who you are. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4448.9800000000005s)]
*  And it is a change, right? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4451.22s)]
*  Because you had the ability to edit it out. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4452.5s)]
*  You chose not to edit it out. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4454.42s)]
*  Didn't mean anything to you. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4455.46s)]
*  You only want to edit it or you only want to talk about it now [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4456.26s)]
*  because of the negative reaction. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4458.900000000001s)]
*  If nobody reacted to it, you wouldn't go back and be like, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4460.26s)]
*  we feel horrible and we have to protect our community [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4462.66s)]
*  and all this other bullshit you're saying. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4464.66s)]
*  The learning lesson here is you do not apologize [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4466.82s)]
*  because you're just going to empower these people who aren't [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4470.099999999999s)]
*  even part of your community in the first place. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4471.94s)]
*  You guys have built something with people who actually know [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4473.7s)]
*  you and care about you. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4477.0599999999995s)]
*  And one thing that happens could never sway them, especially [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4478.259999999999s)]
*  on a podcast where you're joking around. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4481.46s)]
*  Like, it's ridiculous. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4483.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a learning lesson. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4484.42s)]
*  And I think also when you're first going through that, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4485.219999999999s)]
*  you think about, oh, we have black female fans. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4487.38s)]
*  I appreciate them so much. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4489.86s)]
*  I think they must be so hurt by this. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4491.0599999999995s)]
*  They're not hurt by this. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4493.38s)]
*  You don't realize that. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4494.259999999999s)]
*  You start feeling empathy for people that don't feel bad, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4495.3s)]
*  that weren't hurt. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4498.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4499.06s)]
*  You're like, oh, you're thinking about all the black girls [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4499.54s)]
*  you see at the live shows. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4501.78s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4502.74s)]
*  Those girls are probably so heartbroken. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4503.14s)]
*  They think, no, they don't. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4504.58s)]
*  They know who you are. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4506.18s)]
*  Those girls know who you are. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4506.820000000001s)]
*  They know your joke and go out. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4507.9400000000005s)]
*  So I agree with everything you said. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4509.14s)]
*  But I think in their situation, I don't necessarily [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4511.7s)]
*  feel like they shouldn't apologize [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4515.7s)]
*  because their fan base is different. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4517.78s)]
*  You guys are comedians. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4519.7s)]
*  You cultivated a fan base that are used to edgy jokes. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4520.66s)]
*  So their fans tuned into the show [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4523.78s)]
*  and heard them talk or laugh about jokes in a way [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4526.42s)]
*  that they've never done before. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4529.94s)]
*  And so their fans can be disappointed. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4531.54s)]
*  So I don't think it's wrong to necessarily apologize [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4533.78s)]
*  in that aspect. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4536.0199999999995s)]
*  I would agree with you if the reaction to that episode [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4536.98s)]
*  happened immediately after it came out. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4542.74s)]
*  There was no negative reaction after it came out. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4545.7s)]
*  This is like a month, two months after the episode came out. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4549.46s)]
*  And to me, that's indicative of somebody who just likes [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4554.26s)]
*  canceling or causing nonsense on the internet. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4558.26s)]
*  They're trying to like bait people with the... [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4560.26s)]
*  This is also on the back end of another thing about them. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4562.74s)]
*  This supports the thing. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4565.3s)]
*  People are already not liking them for whatever. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4566.74s)]
*  And it's not because of them. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4569.06s)]
*  Because they're resentful, hateful, angry, bitter, jealous [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4570.26s)]
*  people who see these guys fucking killing it, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4573.3s)]
*  being happy, having fun all over. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4575.46s)]
*  They're going across continents. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4577.62s)]
*  For doing nothing. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4578.98s)]
*  Podcasting, it looks like it's the easiest thing in the world. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4580.82s)]
*  And honestly, it's really not that hard. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4583.78s)]
*  I understand why people are resentful of the success [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4585.54s)]
*  of podcasts. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4587.7s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4588.259999999999s)]
*  They don't have another thing that they could do [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4589.94s)]
*  to justify where they are. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4592.099999999999s)]
*  We do stand-up. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4593.78s)]
*  And everybody, you can say whatever you want about stand-up, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4595.379999999999s)]
*  but most people are scared to do it. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4597.62s)]
*  It is an art, a skill that you can refine. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4599.299999999999s)]
*  Say whatever you want about Draymond Green's podcast. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4602.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't talk that much shit about him hooping. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4604.98s)]
*  That shit is hard. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4607.299999999999s)]
*  You can't hoop like him. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4608.1s)]
*  You might be critical. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4609.3s)]
*  You say, oh, I can't shoot, whatever. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4610.26s)]
*  But you can't hoop like him. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4611.46s)]
*  You're not going to lock down seven footers at six, seven, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4612.740000000001s)]
*  or whatever the fuck he is like he does. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4615.38s)]
*  And they don't have that other thing to justify what they have. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4617.06s)]
*  Stand-up, most of you won't even get on the stage. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4620.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4622.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so people are resentful. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4624.26s)]
*  So they do this thing. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4625.38s)]
*  And then they find this podcast clip. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4626.42s)]
*  Just justify whatever BS narrative they're spinning [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4628.1s)]
*  about these guys. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4630.42s)]
*  And then they throw that on the fire. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4631.38s)]
*  And that's why I felt bad that they're using us as a tool. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4632.660000000001s)]
*  And the joke. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4636.900000000001s)]
*  I didn't even know what the joke was. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4637.86s)]
*  I watched the joke. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4638.82s)]
*  It's so clearly a joke. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4639.54s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4640.58s)]
*  It's so clearly a joke. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4641.139999999999s)]
*  And it's funny. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4642.66s)]
*  We said some crazy. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4644.179999999999s)]
*  We've said much crazier things and laughed at it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4644.98s)]
*  That was so quick and so funny and such a turnaround [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4647.0599999999995s)]
*  that you just have to laugh at it. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4649.94s)]
*  It's just taking what you said and then turning it around back on. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4651.219999999999s)]
*  It's like verbal jujitsu. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4653.94s)]
*  And that's why you laugh. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4655.0599999999995s)]
*  I get the position. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4655.78s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4656.82s)]
*  I do think they're nice guys. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4657.219999999999s)]
*  But being in that spot, I just don't ever need to apologize [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4658.42s)]
*  for laughing at a joke. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4662.179999999999s)]
*  If they came on and said the joke, then maybe they can be like, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4663.219999999999s)]
*  look, I did something wrong. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4665.38s)]
*  I said a joke. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4666.42s)]
*  I shouldn't have said. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4667.0599999999995s)]
*  My apologies. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4667.62s)]
*  But they just laughed at a joke. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4668.26s)]
*  I laugh at shit that's fucked up. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4669.94s)]
*  You see a fat person fall off a building and die and crush a daycare. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4672.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4677.94s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4678.58s)]
*  Daycare. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4679.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4679.62s)]
*  You never saw that? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4681.62s)]
*  A fat person fall off a building and crush an entire daycare. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4682.74s)]
*  It's extremely funny. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4684.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4685.38s)]
*  It is a crazy thing that happened. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4685.7s)]
*  It's so tragic. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4686.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4687.7s)]

*  Actually, that's. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4689.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4690.98s)]

*  Who just started saying that? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4692.919999999999s)]
*  It's so bad. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4694.28s)]
*  To be more specific, it does get less funny, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4696.759999999999s)]
*  but it's still pretty funny. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4698.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4699.5599999999995s)]
*  That is a good point. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4700.04s)]
*  That is a good point. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4700.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe we went too far. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4701.24s)]
*  Maybe you guys went too. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4702.12s)]
*  Anyway, we don't have to bring it back to the Jews, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4703.24s)]
*  which is often what happens in conversation. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4705.4s)]
*  But that's what Dub does, though. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4707.08s)]
*  It is. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4708.28s)]
*  He doesn't always bring it back to the Jews with this guy. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4708.36s)]
*  But he had a great time in Vegas. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4710.2s)]
*  Great time. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4711.799999999999s)]
*  He had an amazing time. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4712.44s)]
*  It was not good. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4713.5599999999995s)]
*  He got a game on your phone so much, bro. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4714.04s)]
*  It was not good. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4715.719999999999s)]
*  Every time the camera cuts to you, Dub is on his phone. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4716.2s)]
*  You're watching the fight. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4718.679999999999s)]
*  He's like. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4720.28s)]
*  You see the guy who's videotaping. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4721.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're right there in front. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4723.24s)]
*  Use your eyes. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4725.0s)]
*  Enjoy the moment. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4725.8s)]
*  I have to defend him here. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4727.72s)]
*  Can't see over his nose. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4728.68s)]
*  It is hard. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4729.72s)]
*  Sometimes it can't be. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4731.96s)]
*  My bad. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4733.32s)]
*  My bad. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4733.88s)]
*  That was insensitive of you. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4734.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4735.16s)]
*  And that is all racist. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4735.72s)]
*  I do apologize to all the people. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4736.76s)]
*  That is a fucked up joke. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4737.88s)]
*  I'm sorry that I laughed at that joke. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4739.24s)]
*  Don't be sorry. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4742.2s)]
*  You know what? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4742.92s)]
*  Nah, we have to protect you, Dub. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4743.5599999999995s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4745.08s)]
*  We have to. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4745.5599999999995s)]
*  Anyway, hopefully this is a learning lesson for them. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4746.84s)]
*  They are good guys. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4748.76s)]
*  They're new to this game. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4749.5599999999995s)]
*  And they're going to figure it out. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4750.84s)]
*  But I have noticed this kind of thing happen with the funny people on YouTube [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4751.88s)]
*  that are podcasters that aren't standups. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4757.72s)]
*  It's not just them. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4759.88s)]
*  It's other people as well. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4760.6s)]
*  And I think it's just because they don't really understand the essence of jokes. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4761.96s)]
*  And I think that if they did and jokes were important to them, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4767.56s)]
*  they would defend the jokes. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4770.68s)]
*  You will never have a comedian come in here and apologizing about it. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4772.04s)]
*  Because then we'd have to apologize for every single thing. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4774.52s)]
*  We have to apologize for our existence. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4777.24s)]
*  For them, they're like, all right, we could just apologize and move on. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4779.0s)]
*  It's going to come with you. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4781.48s)]
*  You apologize now. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4782.6s)]
*  The next time you guys laugh at a fucked up joke about something else, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4783.56s)]
*  that community is coming for you. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4786.36s)]
*  Because everybody's sniffing. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4788.04s)]
*  It might be black women now. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4789.64s)]
*  You might make an Asian joke. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4790.84s)]
*  Now the Asians are coming. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4791.88s)]
*  Everybody out there has their antennas up. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4793.4s)]
*  And they're like, yo, we could cancel these motherfuckers [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4795.16s)]
*  because they're going to go bend over the second we start lighting up their Twitter. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4797.32s)]
*  So hopefully this is a learning lesson for them. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4800.92s)]
*  But maybe they have different rules in England or something. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4804.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4806.44s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4807.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's software over there too. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4807.72s)]
*  Like you can't say spaz or the n-word even? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4808.92s)]
*  Yo. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4811.56s)]
*  Wait. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4812.12s)]
*  What? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4813.08s)]
*  I mean, you can't. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4815.56s)]
*  I'm saying you can't. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4816.360000000001s)]
*  Mark, are you going to get us canceled by the spaz community? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4817.72s)]
*  I feel like the spaz community is going to come after us. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4820.92s)]
*  What are they going to do to you? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4823.320000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to say because I feel like that would be inappropriate. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4824.84s)]
*  But they'd probably be really in control. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4829.16s)]
*  And have a very measured approach towards whatever was going on. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4831.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4838.360000000001s)]
*  What does spaz mean out there? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4838.76s)]
*  I think it's Down syndrome. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4840.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's like people have mental disabilities. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4841.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, what is it here? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4844.12s)]
*  It's kind of like a kid that has sugar. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4845.8s)]
*  I think. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4847.96s)]
*  Yeah, isn't it? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4848.360000000001s)]
*  Like you just had frosted mini-wheats in the morning and then you just act like a child. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4849.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4852.68s)]
*  So that's what they think retards are in England? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4853.72s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4855.96s)]
*  That's actually fucked up on y'all's part. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4857.08s)]
*  To call them that, that's derogatory. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4859.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, I thought that's where we got spaz from. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4861.0s)]
*  Because you're acting like a retard. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4863.64s)]
*  No, I thought you were just hyper. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4865.72s)]
*  I'm a spaz on the mic. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=4868.280000000001s)]

*  I mean, yeah. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5181.24s)]
*  The fuck racist. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5181.72s)]
*  You're a racist. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5182.92s)]
*  You're not even in him. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5184.52s)]
*  No. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5185.72s)]
*  You were born here. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5187.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5188.28s)]
*  So I thought that's what it was. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5189.8s)]
*  And I thought that these billion dollar liquor mafias are like, you know, they're in the [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5191.0s)]
*  pockets of these politicians and they're like, hey, listen, look into this guy. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5196.12s)]
*  He's got some fucked up shit. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5198.92s)]
*  He wants to take billions from us. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5200.2s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to deal with this. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5201.48s)]
*  But he said that this guy, and I guess the guy alleged that Diddy was the one who contracted [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5203.96s)]
*  him to kill Tupac. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5212.44s)]
*  Is that? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5213.5599999999995s)]
*  I think so. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5214.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5214.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5214.84s)]
*  And that guy had been locked up. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5217.64s)]
*  So my buddy was basically saying like, listen, that guy's been in jail. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5220.2s)]
*  So he's had a year to cooperate with the feds. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5224.6s)]
*  So he's had a year to learn everything about Diddy. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5227.5599999999995s)]
*  He goes, furthermore, Diddy stuff kept getting leaked. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5230.76s)]
*  The hotel video all of a sudden is leaked. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5234.44s)]
*  Like the fact that there are these videos of all these sexual escapades is leaked. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5237.16s)]
*  Like all this information is getting leaked almost to like sway the public because out [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5242.12s)]
*  of nowhere, they just locked up Diddy. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5246.12s)]
*  Maybe the public would be like, what is this? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5247.639999999999s)]
*  This is horrible. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5250.04s)]
*  This is racist. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5250.92s)]
*  How are you going to take down this successful dude? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5251.8s)]
*  Now that you've got a video of him beating the shit out of the girl, what is her name? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5253.72s)]
*  Cassie, right? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5257.8s)]
*  Now that it's kind of like known and accepted that he's having these crazy sex parties, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5259.16s)]
*  there might be some drug trafficking going on. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5264.5199999999995s)]
*  It's almost like they're preparing the public for the takedown of this very powerful man. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5266.68s)]
*  And I wonder if it does come from that dude. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5271.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5273.08s)]
*  I just, in angle, I didn't see. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5273.4s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5275.24s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5275.96s)]
*  I just thought that those rumors were out there. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5277.8s)]
*  I guess him coming out and saying it was different, I got hired. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5279.72s)]
*  But yeah, I would. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5281.88s)]
*  I'd always heard rumors that he had been killed. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5282.5199999999995s)]
*  Like you hear wild shit about Diddy for decades. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5285.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5287.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5287.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5288.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5288.9400000000005s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5289.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5289.58s)]
*  Because he said that quite a while ago. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5289.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it was a space and time before, since he did that interview and said that, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5292.54s)]
*  Diddy put a price on Tupac's head because he didn't actually contract that particular person. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5297.66s)]
*  There was like some meeting in a hotel where he was saying, oh, I'll put a mill on his head. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5303.42s)]
*  And then these guys said, oh shit, we know there's a price on his head. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5307.900000000001s)]
*  We happen to be in Vegas at the same time. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5312.62s)]
*  Let's get that mill. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5315.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5317.26s)]
*  And you write about mill in 97 with inflation. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5317.82s)]
*  What the fuck is that now? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5320.0599999999995s)]
*  That's crazy money. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5320.94s)]
*  So his three charges are racketeering, sex trafficking, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5323.82s)]
*  and transportation to engage in prostitution. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5326.62s)]
*  Those are the three things. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5329.9s)]
*  I mean, yeah, apparently some of these girls are underage, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5330.62s)]
*  which is going to be its own different thing. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5332.38s)]
*  But I believe the Siroc thing more than anything. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5334.54s)]
*  I didn't put that together, but that makes the most. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5337.179999999999s)]
*  And probably if you're Siroc, you've been hearing all this shit. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5339.179999999999s)]
*  You probably know some shit. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5341.66s)]
*  And we're like, we protected you and you're going to sue us for crazy money. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5343.179999999999s)]
*  All right, let's go. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5347.42s)]
*  I think it was just Cassie. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5349.82s)]
*  It's not our job to protect you anymore. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5351.02s)]
*  Class right now that we're not in business, we're not silencing shit. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5354.22s)]
*  I feel like it was just Cassie because everybody talked in the industry, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5357.18s)]
*  maybe not to this degree, but everybody would talk about, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5361.34s)]
*  people just waiting for somebody to step up. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5364.86s)]
*  And the moment she opened that gate, everybody, now all his security is doing interviews. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5367.42s)]
*  Everybody around him is doing interviews. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5373.42s)]
*  They're trying to clear their name or whatever [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5374.9400000000005s)]
*  because they know they were around it and seeing some of this fuck shit. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5376.46s)]
*  And so I think that's really what happened. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5379.18s)]
*  Yeah, I know it's kind of a trope to say like it's brave to come forward. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5381.02s)]
*  And it seems like it's laws of meaning. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5383.82s)]
*  For her, every human being knew some shit about Diddy that knew him and nobody. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5385.42s)]
*  They were all scared. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5389.9800000000005s)]
*  It's incredibly brave. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5391.42s)]
*  And she's just like, no, here's everything. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5392.06s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5394.38s)]
*  A lot of the people that are powerful that do this kind of stuff coming out. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5394.78s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's coming out, you can argue no matter what is brave [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5398.86s)]
*  because you also have to deal with the scrutiny of that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5401.66s)]
*  But like- [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5403.9s)]
*  For her especially. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5404.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's like even coming out saying like Diddy doesn't pay his taxes is brave. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5405.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5409.42s)]
*  You could give Merck for that. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5409.74s)]
*  And if it doesn't come through, everybody leaves you out in the cold. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5411.18s)]
*  It's not like you get protected. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5414.22s)]
*  Once you come out and accuse a powerful man or something, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5415.26s)]
*  it's not like you get like Secret Service protection. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5417.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5419.1s)]
*  You alone. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5419.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5420.38s)]
*  And you either get touched or lawyers fucking bankrupt you. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5420.9400000000005s)]
*  Even the legal ways that they could drain you are crazy. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5425.58s)]
*  Because you have to engage a lawyer. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5430.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5434.46s)]
*  In order to fight anything that comes in. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5434.86s)]
*  So anybody can sue anybody for anything. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5437.66s)]
*  And you have to call a lawyer to help you with that. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5440.0599999999995s)]
*  And every time you call them, that's money. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5442.38s)]
*  Every hour they spend, that's money. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5444.46s)]
*  They could send what's it called? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5446.46s)]
*  The allegation after allegation. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5448.86s)]
*  They could literally drown you. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5450.54s)]
*  So if you don't have deep pockets, which a lot of these people who are doing taking advantage of don't. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5452.62s)]
*  You're not going to take advantage of some like princess because she got deep pockets. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5456.7s)]
*  She's going to fuck you and her parents are powerful as well. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5459.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5462.219999999999s)]
*  So yeah, all you need is one cease and desist. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5462.86s)]
*  Hey, stop talking about this or we're taking you to court. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5465.259999999999s)]
*  And then you don't even have to get people active. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5467.5s)]
*  You could literally just have a letter and have a lawyer come in. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5469.0199999999995s)]
*  If that guy will do that to you in a hotel lobby, think what he'll do behind closed doors. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5471.5s)]
*  Think about how arrogant Diddy was. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5475.58s)]
*  Oh, insane. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5477.82s)]
*  That he knows what he's done in his life. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5478.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5482.94s)]
*  Diddy is either incredibly arrogant or incredibly innocent. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5484.54s)]
*  Because he knows what he's done in his life. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5488.54s)]
*  Either nothing or something and chose to stay in America. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5490.62s)]
*  Russell Simmons knew he fucked all them girls. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5493.58s)]
*  So he fled to Bali and did fucking Pilates for the last six years. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5496.22s)]
*  You can deny it if you want to, but you ain't been back to America in quite a while. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5499.26s)]
*  Yeah. Like let's call it what it is. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5502.06s)]
*  Nobody goes to Bali during a rainy season. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5503.66s)]
*  You are there every single day. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5506.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5508.54s)]
*  Right. And with the balls to even comment on shit. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5509.1s)]
*  Diddy could have left. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5512.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5513.9800000000005s)]
*  He could have went somewhere. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5514.7s)]
*  I mean, Epstein could have left. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5515.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5517.1s)]
*  Incredibly arrogant. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5517.74s)]
*  I don't think it's arrogant. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5518.62s)]
*  I think he's still running an operation. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5521.1s)]
*  I think he was still running an operation. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5522.46s)]
*  And I think that it was, I think he got flipped on by people that he was working with. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5524.780000000001s)]
*  So then the question is why was Diddy filming all these people? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5529.740000000001s)]
*  Like, sure, you could just be filming people because like you're a freak and you have all [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5533.9800000000005s)]
*  these weird sexual percolation. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5538.14s)]
*  He thinks he's untouchable. That's the arrogance, dude. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5538.9400000000005s)]
*  He said Cassie's a liar knowing there's hotel footage out there. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5540.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5544.14s)]
*  He knew that. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5544.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5545.18s)]
*  He thought he paid to have it buried. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5545.58s)]
*  I 100% agree with you. I think that that is the arrogance. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5547.26s)]
*  Or it's a Whitey Bulger situation. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5549.74s)]
*  Do you guys know Whitey Bulger? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5553.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5554.54s)]
*  The Boston Irish mob guy who was a Fed. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5555.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5558.54s)]
*  And he was working with the Feds. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5558.94s)]
*  So he could do whatever he wants with impunity because he knows he's helping out the Feds. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5560.139999999999s)]
*  So maybe. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5564.54s)]
*  When he said he was a Fed, you mean he was an informant, right? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5565.74s)]
*  Informant. Yeah. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5567.58s)]
*  He was informed. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5568.38s)]
*  So maybe, I think which is what Mark is alluding to, maybe, we don't know. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5569.9s)]
*  These are all allegations or allegedly. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5573.66s)]
*  These are allegedly, sir. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5576.62s)]
*  Maybe, did he was cooperating? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5577.5s)]
*  Maybe, did he had protection? [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5582.14s)]
*  Maybe, did he was sharing some of that surveillance footage or whatever it was that he had with [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5583.66s)]
*  certain, I don't know, three-letter organizations? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5590.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5594.46s)]
*  And because of that, he felt safe. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5594.78s)]
*  He felt protected. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5596.22s)]
*  He's like, they're not going to let me go through this, all the stuff I gave them. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5597.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5601.34s)]
*  Again, I don't know. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5601.82s)]
*  This is a conspiracy theory. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5602.78s)]
*  But as someone that's, if you're blackmailing someone, the worst thing you can do is be [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5604.22s)]
*  exposed, have exposure on you. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5609.34s)]
*  Say that again. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5612.3s)]
*  So in order for Epstein to blackmail people, people can't know he's a blackmailer. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5613.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5617.02s)]
*  In order for Diddy to have people, again, this is a conspiracy theory, but if people [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5617.66s)]
*  are coming to his parties and he's filming them, which is according to the prosecution, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5622.22s)]
*  he has tapes of people at these freak offs. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5624.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5627.02s)]
*  For what purpose and why does he feel so confident? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5629.66s)]
*  I would assume, I guess if I'm going to try to climb into that guy's mind, there's a [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5634.9400000000005s)]
*  lot of stuff about power that he gets off on. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5638.7s)]
*  Like that's what the freak off is. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5640.860000000001s)]
*  Really ruined a fun term, by the way. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5642.3s)]
*  That's what the freak off is. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5643.58s)]
*  It's like, I'm going to make you do this thing. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5644.62s)]
*  Watching a tape is just, I'm seeing my power being exerted again and again. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5646.54s)]
*  That's why I would take it. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5650.7s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a token. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5651.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5652.860000000001s)]
*  Like a serial killer keeps like a button from a victim's shirt. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5653.18s)]
*  And then you inherently have power over them. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5657.26s)]
*  So whether he was sharing it with organizations, again, it's all speculation. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5659.1s)]
*  No one knows. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5662.9400000000005s)]
*  But he definitely has power over them. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5663.9s)]
*  Like if someone's trying to step out of line and like fuck him over, all he has to do is [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5666.54s)]
*  send a picture and be like, yo, by the way, do you remember this? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5669.5s)]
*  And then any problem he has with that person that came to his party at any time goes away. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5672.78s)]
*  Yo, you know what's real funny is that like, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5676.7s)]
*  Shits and Gigs is going through this shit right now. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5678.7s)]
*  You want to know someone who really hates black women? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5681.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5683.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5685.98s)]
*  What about the guy who beat the shit out of one and dragged her through the fucking hotel room? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5686.299999999999s)]
*  What about the guy who's being accused of like sex trafficking them around the country? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5690.7s)]
*  Like what about the guy who's being accused of drug? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5695.26s)]
*  Your energy could be spent. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5698.62s)]
*  Much more wisely. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5700.62s)]
*  Much more wisely. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5701.5s)]
*  Than the people who laughed at a joke. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5702.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5703.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5704.7s)]
*  Much more wise. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5705.0199999999995s)]
*  But again, it's not about helping. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5705.74s)]
*  Helping. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5708.22s)]
*  It's about self. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5708.86s)]
*  It's about feeling power. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5710.46s)]
*  How can I feel power? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5712.0599999999995s)]
*  You can feel power with Diddy. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5713.5s)]
*  The feds already got him. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5714.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5715.9s)]
*  So you need something else. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5716.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5717.5s)]
*  So you think Diddy makes it through this trial or what? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5718.3s)]
*  This feels very Epstein-ish because they got the tapes. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5721.0199999999995s)]
*  They got the records. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5725.179999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people nervous right now, probably. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5726.38s)]
*  He's locked up. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5730.78s)]
*  You think Jay Z's gonna have him killed? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5731.42s)]

*  What a crazy country we live in. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5786.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5788.78s)]
*  You join the CIA. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5789.28s)]
*  You join the FBI because you want to fight evil. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5790.54s)]
*  And now you just gotta watch Diddy have sex with video vixens, male and female, for three months. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5793.74s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta watch the guy that volunteers for that. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5800.139999999999s)]
*  He's like, I'll do it. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5801.58s)]
*  You're like, what? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5802.22s)]
*  What? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5802.72s)]
*  I think Diddy thinks he can beat this because his lawyer said that [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5804.94s)]
*  he was supposed to turn himself in the following day. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5809.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's a douchebag. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5811.66s)]
*  They took him in the day early. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5812.62s)]
*  He also didn't want to be arrested outside of his house or whatever. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5814.06s)]
*  You don't want public photographs of you. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5816.7s)]
*  I know, yeah. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5818.06s)]
*  But I wonder what changed why they arrested him early. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5818.62s)]
*  I think he just pulled up. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5823.42s)]
*  He was like, all right, I'm here. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5824.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5825.26s)]
*  They went to the arrest and met his hotel room. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5826.06s)]
*  I thought he turned himself in. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5828.06s)]
*  No, he was supposed to turn himself in the day after. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5829.18s)]
*  Put it this way. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5832.38s)]
*  And you guys can probably speak to this more than I can, or at least you can now. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5833.66s)]
*  If the feds are after you, good luck. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5839.1s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5843.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wrap. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5844.38s)]
*  It's a wrap, Diddy. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5845.82s)]
*  Yeah. And where is he being tried? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5848.14s)]
*  In the Southern District? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5850.06s)]
*  Real quick, and I'm going to fuck up this story, but there was a very famous story recently [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5851.02s)]
*  of this guy who died on a boat in the Mediterranean. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5856.7s)]
*  I'm going to fuck this whole story up because I haven't read enough. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5861.02s)]
*  But basically, I'm pretty sure that this guy was [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5863.34s)]
*  sued by the federal government and won. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5866.78s)]
*  And then he ended up randomly dead because his boat got flipped or something like that [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5871.42s)]
*  in the middle of the Mediterranean, and they're saying because it got windy. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5877.9s)]
*  A water spout apparently hit the mast and knocked this boat down. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5880.86s)]
*  A gigantic boat. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5884.46s)]
*  The point being, they're going to get you one way or another. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5886.54s)]
*  The feds? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5892.0599999999995s)]
*  If they believe that you did the fucked up thing, you're going down. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5892.56s)]
*  It could be wrong, but we're talking about a 95% conviction rate or something like that. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5897.280000000001s)]
*  So I think they're basically like, hey, listen, Diddy, you did the shit. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5902.160000000001s)]
*  Or there's enough powerful people out there like, I don't trust him being an [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5906.0s)]
*  operative anymore. Time for you to go. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5909.68s)]
*  Who knows? This could all be bullshit. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5912.400000000001s)]
*  But it feels to me that it is very important to some people out there that Diddy goes down. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5915.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's like a hypothetical that if the feds want you, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5922.4800000000005s)]
*  they're going to get you. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5927.120000000001s)]
*  I was even talking to a guy the other day, this guy, Frank Parlato. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5929.6s)]
*  He was like the main journalist that exposed NXIVM. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5932.64s)]
*  Oh, the cult. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5936.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And he basically did the whole expose. He took them down. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5936.96s)]
*  The reason he took them down is because they came for him [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5940.240000000001s)]
*  because he was a consultant that then left. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5942.56s)]
*  And so they came after him, like tried to sue him into oblivion, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5944.96s)]
*  and he basically just exposed the whole thing and eventually got them all arrested. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5947.68s)]
*  But he was saying that after the case, it actually changed the precedent for sex [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5951.12s)]
*  trafficking in New York, which is interesting that this guy, Ranieri, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5955.679999999999s)]
*  is indicted on sex trafficking. And basically what he says, and he actually regrets this, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5961.04s)]
*  is what he told me again. This is what he said. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5964.96s)]
*  That basically sex trafficking now, specifically with the grand jury, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5968.08s)]
*  because grand juries apparently are super malleable from prosecution. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5971.12s)]
*  Like the old saying is like a grand jury can indict a ham sandwich is like the [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5974.879999999999s)]
*  term that people use that you could, a grand jury, you can just roll over. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5978.4s)]
*  What does grand jury mean to the selection of your peers? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5981.04s)]
*  It is, but the prosecution is selected. And so you get like the best prosecutors and you get [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5984.0s)]
*  more of them or something to that effect. And then in a grand jury at the closing statements, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5989.04s)]
*  the prosecution leads the closing statement and then the defense gets a word and then the [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5992.96s)]
*  prosecution gets another word at the end, which gives you a huge advantage when it comes to [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=5996.639999999999s)]
*  persuading. Yeah, that's the last thing in your mind before you convict. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6000.16s)]
*  The first thing and the last. Yeah. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6002.48s)]
*  Whoa. So apparently grand jury- [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6003.92s)]
*  Just need majority. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6005.36s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6007.04s)]
*  Don't need unanimous vote. That's right. So it's basically a system that's set up to be like, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6007.839999999999s)]
*  hey, we need this guy clipped. Because convictions are also really [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6011.759999999999s)]
*  important for DAs. And it's like, it helps the whole system to get these convictions. Also, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6014.799999999999s)]
*  if everything is like pending and you get hung jury after hung jury after hung jury, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6018.639999999999s)]
*  it costs so much money. It takes so much time. So there's kind of a system where again, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6021.599999999999s)]
*  they can kind of like manipulate these grand juries a little more. This is from what people [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6025.679999999999s)]
*  have spoken to. He says that the sex trafficking laws in New York have changed to the degree that [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6028.639999999999s)]
*  if you basically introduce someone, this is, he says like the worst case, and there's been precedent [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6034.32s)]
*  for this since the next thing, if let's say one guy introduces a girl to another guy, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6039.84s)]
*  and they have sex, and it's consensual, and it's fine. And the other guy rewards the first dude in [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6045.84s)]
*  any way, shape or form, whether it's like, hey, let me buy you a drink. That girl was awesome. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6051.92s)]
*  Thanks for setting me up. That can be considered sex trafficking. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6055.679999999999s)]
*  Wow. This is what he said again. I don't know exactly. He says it can go even as far as to [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6058.48s)]
*  expressing gratitude. So like a text message like, dude, you're the man. Thanks so much for [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6062.96s)]
*  setting me up. He's again, this guy parlato says that the precedent now since that case that he [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6067.44s)]
*  helped expose now can kind of wrap up anyone that's ever been set up by someone under sex [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6072.4s)]
*  traffic. Now this is how you amazing wingman's out there. But this is how these things work. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6077.6s)]
*  You have a situation where there is a guy who's, let's say a pimp or something like that, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6085.44s)]
*  or even like a girl, somebody who's running some other girls. You give a girl to another dude. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6089.92s)]
*  You don't even accept payment. You're just doing it because that's what your skill is. You've got [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6096.72s)]
*  a bunch of girls. You're passing them around, and maybe you get payment from something else. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6100.88s)]
*  You get payment from getting a percentage of this business thing, or you get to invest in [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6104.64s)]
*  this company in like early seeds. They try to create protection for the women, which I think [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6108.4800000000005s)]
*  makes a lot of sense. They're like, if the only way we can clip this guy is to prove that money [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6115.2s)]
*  was exchanged, then we can't protect these girls. Then politicians go and they go, I want to have [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6119.84s)]
*  the protect women act. And then what person could possibly, the Patriot act or the protect women act. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6124.96s)]
*  So now you have these rules that can be taken advantage of by very innocent cases, meaning a [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6132.32s)]
*  guy connects his boy with a girl. Then he goes, bro, that was the most amazing. She was the hottest [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6141.36s)]
*  she could do. Let me take you out to dinner or something. This girl's amazing. She's so hot. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6146.96s)]
*  And if you want, you could clip that guy through this law that was genuinely made to protect women. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6150.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. If they want to come after you. If they want to come after you. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6157.36s)]
*  The feds are not going to fucking send a letter to someone for being a wingman. But if you're in [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6159.759999999999s)]
*  jail or if you're being indicted and you have a bunch of tax fraud and shit, and they can also [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6163.5199999999995s)]
*  throw this on. Throw it on. Pile it on. That's kind of like the Rico thing. It's like, hey, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6167.44s)]
*  if you did anything criminal involving a business or commercial entity in any capacity, now you're [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6173.28s)]
*  on racketeering. So they expand these things to get these mob guys, but then there's other people [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6178.16s)]
*  that then can fall under. And they're not going to peel it back. And then you can even just have [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6182.4s)]
*  precedent. So you don't necessarily need to do the law. You can just be like, oh, well, in this case, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6187.04s)]
*  this happens. So therefore in future cases, this other thing will happen the same way. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6190.32s)]
*  And we're back. Listen, I've discovered a couple things this week on the internet that I'd like [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6194.32s)]
*  to share with you guys. You know, I'm not a gatekeeper, but so obviously, you know, my [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6197.92s)]
*  obsession with Indian Instagram, it's not TikTok, because TikTok is not allowed there. But Indian [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6202.799999999999s)]
*  Instagram is absolutely incredible. I suggest that you watch a couple of videos, like them, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6210.08s)]
*  and just let the algorithm do its thing. My Instagram is so beautifully curated to only see [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6214.719999999999s)]
*  Indian people doing absolutely hilarious shit. It doesn't matter what they do. It's hilarious. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6221.92s)]
*  There's a guy who just cuts watermelons and opens them and screams. So this is my man. I love this guy. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6226.72s)]
*  Okay, now go to some of the other ones. Can you go to the mud thing? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6252.56s)]
*  The mud thing was absolutely exceptional. I don't want to believe the mud thing. Obviously, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6258.08s)]
*  it's like a fun little joke. But Instagram wants me to believe it. I get it. Because this right here [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6262.24s)]
*  is, does anybody know what this is? It's just little kids playing around. They are 25 years old. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6270.4800000000005s)]
*  They're this is full grown adults. And he got the Indian flag behind him. I almost feel like this [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6278.72s)]
*  is like Pakistanis like trying to troll Indians. It might be. It could be, right? Yeah, like, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6284.72s)]
*  because why would you? Why is he? He loves that mud. He's going. He can't breathe. He can't breathe. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6289.92s)]
*  It's a scion from Pakistan. I think it's a scion from Pakistan. I mean, look at him burying that [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6298.0s)]
*  face in that man. And then the back handspring mud dive is crazy. So guys give me one of these. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6303.36s)]
*  Yeah, that looks fun. Don't it? I think it's Pakistan. I think you got to blame Pakistan for [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6312.4s)]
*  this. I really do. Okay, give us more. Give us more. I mean, I promise you there is. It's actually [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6319.36s)]

*  with his phone because it is unbelievable. They did not find a little crack. Oh, dude, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6328.64s)]
*  I think they made a little crack. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, he's stuck. Oh, there's so much of this. Like, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6336.4800000000005s)]

*  You have given me so much joy over the past week. This one is clearly set up to try to get views, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6361.36s)]
*  which is so fun. It's almost worse. That's what's so funny. All of it is kind of like set up. And [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6366.639999999999s)]

*  I mean, it is very like Bollywood inspired, which is actually kind of fire. Oh, like you'll see a [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6380.96s)]

*  But then I got money. Yeah. And then he like walked by with like a chain and the girl's like, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6390.8s)]
*  what did I do? It's fine. I like them. There's some production value. I think you just got, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6394.96s)]
*  we got to thank the Imbanis for this because they gave everyone self-service. Wait, did they do that? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6400.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of the Imbani brothers. I think Mukesh, the one who's wedding. Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6404.16s)]
*  We have them. Thank you. Shout out the Imbanis, man. What you've done, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6407.76s)]

*  single one and I keep on sending. Oh, we got to send people to a grandies new page. Oh yeah. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6421.52s)]
*  So Graham wizard chat word we can't say has gotten his page blocked from Instagram. He has come back [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6427.84s)]
*  with a vengeance. New Instagram pages, grand Davias, G R A N D A V I O U S go follow it [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6434.48s)]
*  immediately. I need every one of y'all to go out there and support grandee. This is the funniest [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6443.759999999999s)]
*  Instagram account on the internet. This one was good. Oh my God. This one was really good. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6449.44s)]
*  The Indian ones are good, but then the Jewish ones are also pretty good. There's a lot of anti [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6458.719999999999s)]
*  semitism on the internet, but sometimes they get the joke right and it is. Can you see this one? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6462.16s)]
*  How you feel about that one? Go right here. Can you make it bigger? Jewish piano? Yeah. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6467.36s)]
*  One of my faves. We share it too. Guys. Really? We love a good Jewish joke. Thank you. See? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6471.92s)]
*  Anti-semite. You are an anti-semite for that. Wait, can we talk about the Superbowl controversy? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6480.24s)]
*  We never even spoke about that. I thought we did. Kendrick? I don't know if we did. We didn't? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6486.5599999999995s)]
*  We didn't talk about Kendrick, I don't think. We didn't talk about Kendrick. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6492.16s)]
*  Do you think he did this just to troll Drake and Cole? Because in first person shooter, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6495.92s)]
*  they keep saying they're as big as the Superbowl. And then he's like, you know what? I'll just do [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6501.04s)]
*  the Superbowl. Yeah. I mean, it's just such a tricky thing. I don't know if he did it to troll [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6505.84s)]
*  him. I definitely think he did it to troll him when he said there's no round two. That was a [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6514.16s)]
*  clear shot. Yeah. But I think, are you sure we didn't talk about this? No. We did. I can't [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6518.88s)]
*  remember. We didn't. Because the biggest... Maybe because we talk about it on Idiots. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6524.64s)]
*  We talk about it on Idiots. The biggest nail in the coffin, or the final nail in the coffin, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6528.24s)]
*  would be if Drake brings out Wayne... Kendrick. Sorry, if Kendrick brings out Wayne at the [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6534.24s)]
*  Superbowl. Yeah. It's a wrap. It is. Yeah. That is over. I think that's also part of his thing. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6540.64s)]
*  He probably could have done this before. I do think there's a reason he put his hat in this year [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6547.280000000001s)]
*  for his name. I don't know if that's how it works, but he's open to it this year, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6551.52s)]
*  or as I don't think he would have been before. And I also think if Wayne got it and brought out [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6555.200000000001s)]
*  Drake, that would have helped out Drake a lot. And he was like, let's squash that. Let's get out in [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6559.12s)]
*  front of that or the war type shit. And then if he can bring Wayne out, it's fucking... That's big. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6563.68s)]
*  I mean, yeah. It's just the best move. Kendrick's had the biggest year. It was either Kendrick or [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6570.72s)]
*  Taylor. Yeah. Yeah. Two big as artists. I'm shocked Taylor didn't do it. Yeah. Taylor don't need to. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6576.4s)]
*  But I mean, if she did, she'd not... Now, I will say this. I don't know if Taylor serves the football [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6582.4s)]
*  watching audience. I would argue she's already serving the football watching audience just by [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6589.599999999999s)]
*  being at the Chiefs games. And if the Chiefs make the Superbowl? No, it would be crazy. But [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6597.2s)]
*  what I'm saying is I don't know if the average football fan listens to Taylor. Yeah. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6602.24s)]
*  The average football fan definitely has heard this Kendrick song. Yeah. I also think her PR team, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6606.799999999999s)]
*  Taylor's team, is like, you know, you perform at the Superbowl is going to be a lot of negative [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6612.24s)]
*  PR. Tons of negative PR. Yeah. They're already hating on you for having like two minutes of [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6616.24s)]
*  cutaways during a game. Yeah. You do the halftime show. Forget it. But I feel like the Superbowl, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6620.24s)]
*  it's more... It's different than... Non-football fans watching than actual footballers. I agree. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6624.799999999999s)]
*  Also apparently Jay-Z chooses this and I could see him... It's been Rap-X or Black-X, I guess, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6628.879999999999s)]
*  since he took over. And I think he probably is going to choose Kendrick over Taylor. Yeah. And [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6635.12s)]
*  I feel like it's so stupid for people to be complaining like, yo, we have a rapper performing [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6639.84s)]
*  at the fucking Superbowl. Be happy. It's almost like it's never enough with you guys. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6644.4s)]
*  Doesn't it kind of feel like that for me? Dude, also I've found a legendary... This is like an OG [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6650.08s)]
*  amazing... I never got this. You sent this... I think I've seen this one. Have I showed you this [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6657.44s)]
*  like 10 times? Yeah. You were like, this is the funniest thing. I never got it. Yeah, I've seen [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6663.28s)]
*  this one. Horrible. All right, now I feel bad. Now I'm scared. This is a horrible example of [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6667.84s)]
*  Indian Instagram and I don't want anybody to judge Indian Instagram by this. Baby, I want cool ring. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6672.48s)]
*  No, baby. It's not good for health. Okay. No cool ring, huh? Break up. Break up. Break up. Break up. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6679.68s)]
*  Break up. Break up. Break up. Break up. Break up. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6687.76s)]
*  Break up. Idea. Vidya. Oh, he's got a plan. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6691.6s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6702.24s)]
*  I have your father number. Oh my God. Oh my God. You have my father number. Don't call to my father, baby. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6706.0s)]
*  No, baby. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6713.6s)]
*  That's a banger, dude. The video was shit, but the accent is up. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6732.96s)]
*  I was just laughing at the sound coming out of the picture. There you go. Baby. Baby. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6737.360000000001s)]
*  Mark sent me that. He's like, this is the funniest thing. He showed me too. I think years ago, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6743.92s)]
*  I think this might have been half a decade ago I sent you that video. Bro, there's one of a Zoom call [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6748.8s)]
*  with like a teacher is trying to do a Zoom class and these guys start arguing on the Zoom and it's [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6754.64s)]
*  so fucking funny. I wish I can find it. Let me see if I can find it. Also, just phone number out there. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6760.16s)]
*  That dad's number is on the street. Oh, shit. We can call him. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, we might have to. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6765.84s)]
*  We might have to prank him. Let him know his traveling ass daughter is getting cold drinks. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6771.76s)]
*  I mean, how dare she? Yeah, it's not good for health. Dude, yeah, we gotta go to India, man. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6777.52s)]
*  Immediately. We gotta go to India. We gotta jump in that mud. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6782.32s)]
*  How can you not? How can you not? How can you not? I mean, it is when you're in India, let me, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6785.52s)]
*  and I mean this, I'm not trying to like insult here. Do you eat the street food? Can you handle? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6797.120000000001s)]
*  No, I cannot. Okay. So it wouldn't be advisable. There are places that will make that same food [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6801.68s)]
*  with bottled water and that's where I'll eat. Oh, is it the water that they issue? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6806.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, probably other things, but that's the main thing. I saw a guy cutting meat with his [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6811.6s)]
*  big toenail. That's you. No, I eat the big toenail, but I don't cut the meat with it. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6815.04s)]
*  He was using his big toe to slice the meat in half. That's fire. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6822.96s)]
*  I failed to see the issue. I mean, that was a really effective response. I have nothing, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6828.8s)]
*  I can't say anything to that. All I'm saying is that there is the link in the flagrant. Yeah, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6833.6s)]
*  but you don't have to watch it here, but to me, I don't know, Indians laugh at this one a lot. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6837.76s)]
*  All right. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. All right. Let me pull this up. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6841.28s)]
*  My cute face just popped up. I'm like, what the fuck is going on? [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6843.84s)]
*  It's in the flagrant. I'm going to find you also heat. This is a, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6846.4s)]
*  yeah, hold on. She's just trying to conduct a zoom class, get these guys to cooperate. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6855.679999999999s)]
*  So, please just look into it and ensure that it becomes a part of any of the group. I mean, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6862.48s)]
*  that is quite doable. Yeah. And so that's a request. Please contribute to them. Whatever. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6870.48s)]
*  Yeah, I try to contribute, ma'am. I can't do anything. See, I mean, I can't help it, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6876.08s)]
*  but if there's so much of friction, it's better not to work together. I mean, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6883.36s)]
*  you want to group and come at me. They can come at me. I don't give a shit about them. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6886.959999999999s)]
*  They are nothing. Calm down, please. Yeah. Probably my servant earns more than Benak's dad. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6892.639999999999s)]
*  Ha ha ha. No, don't cross the line. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6897.360000000001s)]
*  There is a reason why nobody likes associating with you. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6910.72s)]
*  Girlfriend like associating with everybody else other than you. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6916.08s)]
*  Shit. Damn. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6919.52s)]
*  Don't say that. Don't say that. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6920.72s)]
*  So that the issue is resolved. You have to join some other group. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6924.72s)]
*  I'll kill him. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6927.68s)]
*  He's here. You speak to me after the session. The session gets over. Okay. And no, no. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6932.8s)]
*  So that leads. Please. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6939.76s)]
*  Benak, how much does your dad earn? [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6942.32s)]
*  Funniest content on planet Earth right now coming out of India. And it's not even close. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6955.2s)]
*  It's not even close. It's not even close. The pause always kills me. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6959.36s)]
*  How much does your dad earn? She's begging him to stop. He's quiet. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6964.799999999999s)]
*  What is that? What a callback. It's just some Zoom. I don't know how they put it out there. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6969.5199999999995s)]
*  It was some Zoom class. But probably during COVID, teachers teaching over Zoom and they [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6974.5599999999995s)]
*  got to do a group project and then there's just a cease-challenging to mediate this issue. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6978.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That's great. I mean, yeah, we just need to watch it. We got to meet these guys. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6982.4s)]
*  Oh, I already have all the people that I want to hang out with. I want to do Watermelon Guy. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6987.2s)]
*  There's another guy that's like incredibly skinny. He's kind of like weird, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6990.719999999999s)]
*  but he does a lot of content that's really good that I need to go into the mud diving guys, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=6994.88s)]
*  need to connect with them. I'm going to put a list of them together. I mean, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7000.0s)]
*  I send it to the group chat, but none of you guys respond because you're all pieces of fuck. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7003.36s)]
*  So, I mean, I always want to go find my good ones just so that you guys can enjoy and indulge in this. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7008.0s)]
*  Guys, what else is going on in the world today? Oh, I saw Beetlejuice. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7016.72s)]
*  Oh, I heard it was fire. I saw a film. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7020.639999999999s)]
*  Have you seen the first one? I did see the first one. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7023.200000000001s)]
*  Okay. How is it? I've heard this is really good. It is good. It is good. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7025.200000000001s)]
*  You missed Vegas for Beetlejuice. Why do you need the sphere when you have the rectangle? [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7028.64s)]
*  I can talk about that. When you have the rectangle, you don't always need the circle. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7034.96s)]
*  This guy's always doing too much. He's always chasing too much. You know what I mean? Why can't [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7038.72s)]
*  you just be happy with the theater? He's the reason the theaters are dying. It's his fault. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7041.52s)]
*  You put yourself in a cycle. That was just salad right there. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7045.52s)]
*  Why don't you go see Beetlejuice? Did you see that movie as a child? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7051.2s)]
*  I saw it as a tween. Oh, so you've seen it? [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7053.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I saw the original. So, fantastic movie. Please give us your, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7056.5599999999995s)]
*  as I send you this one to the group, please give us- [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7060.5599999999995s)]
*  You guys saw it too? I haven't seen the new one. I want to. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7062.96s)]
*  I haven't seen it, but I did hear an interesting thing about it. I heard that Michael Keaton is [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7066.08s)]
*  only in it for between five or 15 minutes total. Yeah, but it's also only a 90-minute movie. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7071.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's in it probably, I would say probably 15. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7079.28s)]
*  He apparently said that he wouldn't be in it any longer than he was the first movie. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7082.799999999999s)]
*  The whole thing, I think, with the first movie was the fear of Beetlejuice. Don't say it three [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7090.799999999999s)]
*  times or else he's going to show up. What's interesting is the revisionist history we have [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7095.599999999999s)]
*  on that movie, very similar to Independence Day, where the way I remember that movie is that he was [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7101.44s)]
*  the star of the movie and he was in it the entire time. I thought so too. He's in it for five, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7105.92s)]
*  10, 15 minutes tops. You have to fuck out of here. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7110.72s)]
*  But he's so unique, interesting, charismatic that you think the whole movie is him. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7113.4400000000005s)]
*  Also, the title helps. Yeah. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7118.64s)]
*  Independence Day- What's that? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7121.12s)]
*  Hannibal Lecter has this. Yeah, Hannibal Lecter is another one. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7122.64s)]
*  But Independence Day with Will Smith, I thought he was the protagonist of the movie. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7126.0s)]
*  Will is so fucking charming. Yeah, I guess he's one of three. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7132.0s)]
*  He is the C-plot. That's wild. If you even just asked me now, I'd be like, yeah, he's in the whole [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7135.12s)]
*  movie. But that's how unbelievably charismatic. The character is unbelievable. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7141.36s)]
*  Well, you said five to 15 minutes. Then I was like, wait, was he in it a bunch the first time? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7146.0s)]
*  And I guess not. It's an Alec Baldwin Winona Ryder movie. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7149.92s)]
*  And the girl who's in Fielding. Gina Gershon. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7155.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no. Gina Davis. Gina Davis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7157.04s)]
*  They're the big stars. He's barely in it, but he's so weird, unique, and funny. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7160.72s)]
*  It's really fun. I would recommend going see it. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7166.240000000001s)]
*  No, I heard the plot is nothing like the first one. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7168.240000000001s)]
*  There's a ton of homages and threads that tie through to the first one. It's really fun. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7171.84s)]
*  And I think they kind of got into this place where they had three or four great sequel ideas [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7175.76s)]
*  and plots for the sequel. And instead of picking one or two, they kind of did all four. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7180.400000000001s)]
*  Blended them. And so the pacing is a little fast, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7184.0s)]
*  but it's extremely engaging and so fun. The whole time I was just like, this is the fun. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7187.52s)]
*  I'm having a blast. Oh, really? [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7191.52s)]
*  I'm so glad I'm not in Vegas. Literally, I was watching it and I was like, I'm so [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7192.96s)]
*  glad I'm not meeting Shaquille Neal. That would suck. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7196.400000000001s)]
*  Shaq is the man, I just want to say. Yeah, he's fucking awesome. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7198.88s)]
*  And also when you go to a Shaq show, it is, the perception of like a quote unquote celebrity DJ [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7202.8s)]
*  is that they're just going to play like the hits and it's just going to be easy. It is hard dubstep. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7211.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, it is. The cage shakers like just fucking going for it. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7218.400000000001s)]
*  It is. How would you know? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7222.240000000001s)]
*  Shaq shit? He wasn't there. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7224.320000000001s)]
*  You're mean, dude. He Wikipedia'd it. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7227.6s)]
*  Yeah, they have it on Wikipedia, hard dubstep. Like it is, it is just intense, pounding. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7229.76s)]
*  I've heard that he's like actually into DJing. He like loves it. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7236.64s)]
*  Yes. And like people ask him about basketball and he's like, oh, whatever. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7239.4400000000005s)]
*  And then they ask him about music and he's like, oh, let's go. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7242.160000000001s)]
*  I'm locked in. He's like you and Paddle. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7244.240000000001s)]
*  Exactly. And shout out to P1 Paddle. We played both days we were there. 100%. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7245.68s)]
*  And 90 degree Las Vegas heat. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7250.400000000001s)]
*  Dove box office again or what? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7252.4800000000005s)]
*  Dove box office. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7254.0s)]
*  Day one, Andrew came back. Well, day two. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7255.04s)]
*  But yeah, they did good. They did good. They did good. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7257.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. Have you been focusing on standup in your career? [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7260.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, no. This is my singular focus. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7264.96s)]
*  But continue on top of just Shaq. We followed up with, you know, a nice visit with. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7268.88s)]
*  Yeah, we went to go see 50 and and his guys star stars. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7273.12s)]
*  Fuck them. They're both fucking great. Tony Ayo is just hilarious. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7277.04s)]
*  So that 50 and Tony relationship is just hilarious. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7280.24s)]
*  Like Tony's just like a wild boy. He'll be like saying funny shit. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7283.44s)]
*  We got to get him on stage for like one minute. Like doing standup. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7287.12s)]
*  And then 50 is like is like teasing him about the wild shit that Tony said. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7290.08s)]
*  And then like there's like meme culture built into it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7294.88s)]
*  Like they're also aware of it. Remember when 50 is like, why you gotta say fuck me for? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7298.16s)]
*  That is like at one point, Tony says it after something 50 said. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7303.04s)]
*  So like you're like witnessing these guys who are also like aware of what's going on in it. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7307.68s)]
*  But like have clearly been friends for like decades. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7312.08s)]
*  And without any of the pretense of I need to be cool. I'm a rapper. I can only be cool. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7314.8s)]
*  It's people who are comfortable with themselves. And it's refreshing to see. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7320.16s)]
*  Because you've been around some famous people who like I need to uphold whatever the image of me is [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7323.84s)]
*  and what people think of me. And I don't know. From what I get from them is like I know what I [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7328.72s)]
*  think of me so I don't give a fuck and I'm just going to be still what I want. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7335.76s)]
*  Right. It's funny you saw Shaq and 50 the same night. I think they're both like that. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7338.88s)]
*  Shaq is like, I like rave music. I'm just going to go for it. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7343.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. Yeah, Shaq seems super secure. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7346.88s)]
*  And Mark, you know what's crazy about this? That was just night one. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7348.72s)]
*  It's just night one. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7351.04s)]

*  Just night one. Just night one. No big deal. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7356.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7359.84s)]
*  Then we went to what you call it. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7361.12s)]
*  You called her an Uber? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7362.8s)]
*  Poppy steak. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7365.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, we did the whole thing. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7367.52s)]
*  You didn't even call her an Uber? You're a scumbag. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7368.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you have a show in Vegas though? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7370.4800000000005s)]
*  Say what? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7372.64s)]
*  Did you have a show in Vegas? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7372.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We had a show in Vegas. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7373.6s)]
*  When? What night? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7374.64s)]
*  That was Friday. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7375.280000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7376.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was great. We had a show at Found Blue. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7376.4800000000005s)]
*  Y'all, found blue is about to... [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7378.64s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that's the building out there. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7380.96s)]
*  Found Blue is going to put the pressure on the wind. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7382.88s)]
*  So for the last, I don't know, how many years? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7386.64s)]
*  Five, six, seven years, the wind has been the... [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7388.56s)]
*  Decade. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7390.56s)]
*  I don't know what the casino's like. I didn't go to the casino. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7391.6s)]
*  But just as the hotel, the wind has been the one. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7394.08s)]
*  It's like elegant, it's like elevated, it's nice, whatever. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7398.320000000001s)]
*  And Found Blue, crazy story to end up getting built, but it is... [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7402.320000000001s)]
*  It's the best hotel in Vegas. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7408.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's the most expensive building in Vegas. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7410.320000000001s)]
*  I heard one of the most expensive in the world. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7412.08s)]
*  It is insane. But when it comes to restaurants, vibe, party, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7413.44s)]
*  you're in it and you're just like, oh, this is the one. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7420.799999999999s)]
*  And it's going to be really interesting to see what happens. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7423.759999999999s)]
*  Because now the wind, who hasn't had to do anything for the last seven years, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7428.32s)]
*  they got a pivot. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7432.48s)]
*  Because the last thing you want to do is start to feel a little older. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7434.16s)]
*  And I think that's what Found Blue is going to do. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7437.759999999999s)]
*  I think Found Blue is going to age the clientele and the wind up. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7439.2s)]
*  Because I think the young people are going to be like, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7443.5199999999995s)]
*  well, I want to go to Poppy Stake when I'm in Miami. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7444.96s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I want to go to Liv. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7448.24s)]
*  Liv Beach, you've got Dom Dala and then John Summit. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7449.759999999999s)]
*  When? Like when I'm in Miami. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7453.12s)]
*  Like when I'm in Miami. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7454.48s)]
*  Because those are Miami haunts that now they have transferred. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7455.12s)]
*  Like, dude, that's the thing I realized when I went to Vegas. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7457.919999999999s)]
*  Anytime a place has got like a really great local brand and they want to expand, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7460.48s)]
*  almost always Vegas first. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7464.639999999999s)]
*  Carbone, Vegas. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7466.799999999999s)]
*  Anything that... [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7468.24s)]
*  If you're in Vegas and there's some great restaurant in New York or L.A. or Miami, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7468.96s)]
*  just wait. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7472.4s)]
*  It's coming to you. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7473.04s)]
*  But think about it, right? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7473.92s)]
*  Like it makes a lot of sense. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7474.8s)]
*  And of course, the places that you choose are really important because they cultivate [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7476.48s)]
*  the personnel and they cultivate the clientele of your casino, the acts you get. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7480.8s)]
*  Everything is really important because it sets a precedent for who goes to your casino. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7486.56s)]
*  And who goes to that casino is who you want to be with when you go there. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7490.88s)]
*  When you go to Vegas, you say like maybe an older hotel, you're like Circus Circus. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7495.28s)]
*  And there's a bunch of people on the fucking little... [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7498.64s)]
*  The rascals. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7501.04s)]
*  The rascals are at the slots. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7501.6s)]
*  You're like, I don't know if this is the vibe that I want yet. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7502.88s)]
*  Maybe when I'm 80, that's what I want. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7505.120000000001s)]
*  But right now, and they got Grutman and they got... [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7506.64s)]
*  There's got Dave Grutman who has all the restaurants out there in Miami. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7511.04s)]
*  And he's taking care of that aspect of it. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7514.96s)]
*  And they basically, they assembled it really fucking well around vibe and party. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7517.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of casinos are like, how can I just assemble around casino? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7526.96s)]
*  Because that is what makes money. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7530.8s)]
*  But what makes you want to be there is vibe party. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7532.4800000000005s)]
*  And then once you're there, the whales go, well, I want to be at the best vibe party. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7536.32s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I'm going to drop a million dollars in the casino, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7541.28s)]
*  but I also want to be around all the cool... [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7543.76s)]
*  Where's the girl's at? Where's the cool thing at? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7545.28s)]
*  And then if you want the quieter one, they've got Mother Wolf, they've got China Club, which is like... [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7546.64s)]
*  They got all the shit. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7550.96s)]
*  They have both versions. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7551.52s)]
*  And it seems like, it genuinely seems like we're dick riding. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7552.8s)]
*  And yes, they paid me to do a show there, 100%. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7555.12s)]
*  I'm dick riding. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7556.88s)]
*  But also, you also have to understand how this thing works. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7557.76s)]
*  It's not like, at this point, we don't get paid to do a show. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7560.56s)]
*  We pay ourselves. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7565.68s)]
*  We do a show at a venue. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7567.12s)]
*  Yeah. And the people buy tickets and then that money goes to us. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7568.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's not like... [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7572.08s)]
*  Fountain Blue is not paying you a bag to do X, Y, Z. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7573.68s)]
*  You get paid what you bring in. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7576.24s)]
*  So if nobody comes, then I don't get anything. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7578.0s)]
*  And then if people come, then I get it. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7579.68s)]
*  And I've done other shows out there. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7582.24s)]
*  I've gone to Vegas a while, for a while now. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7583.92s)]
*  I used to go to Summer League a bunch like that. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7586.64s)]
*  That's where we stayed at Encore, the win. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7588.240000000001s)]
*  Party. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7590.96s)]
*  If you're going to party and you want it to be young or more fun, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7592.160000000001s)]
*  you're at Fountain Blue. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7597.360000000001s)]
*  If you want it to be older and Asian-y, you go to Wim. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7598.160000000001s)]
*  It's older and Asian-y. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7602.0s)]
*  They know... [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7602.96s)]
*  The win is trying to attract rich Asians to go gamble, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7603.4400000000005s)]
*  which is vibes. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7606.160000000001s)]
*  If you're a fucking rich Asian, go there. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7606.96s)]
*  But if you want young, fun... [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7609.12s)]
*  They had this... [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7611.12s)]
*  You know John Sumit as the DJ? [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFdRz46vZc&t=7611.84s)]
