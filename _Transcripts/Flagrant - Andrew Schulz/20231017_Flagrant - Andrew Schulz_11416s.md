*  I walk up to him. Hey, man, what's up? How are you? And he looked at me. He goes [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2083.06s)]

*  Your audition tape sucked and just like leave I think it was unnecessary [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2120.02s)]
*  I do I told some people this and they all sort of say the same thing like they were like playing [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2123.14s)]
*  They were playing mind games [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2129.38s)]
*  Like I think it was a very like mind gamey thing. I always hate that [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2131.78s)]
*  It's like to me why would do that shit is like for what me too? What do they do? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2135.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, they would just be they would tell you it's like a two-week boot camp [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2139.14s)]
*  And i'm gonna do top to bottom the cast of while and i'll always say this most talented group of people [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2142.42s)]
*  Yeah, my god insane [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2146.58s)]

*  And then he'll the guy would just say shit like I guess some of y'all are gonna be losing episodes [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2155.54s)]
*  I guess some y'all and they just like hold that thing over your head for two weeks [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2160.26s)]
*  I my confidence got worse and worse and worse and one thing I did I reached out to the guy like went to the hotel [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2163.6200000000003s)]
*  Where all the while and all people were stands like dude like three days before we started filming [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2169.1400000000003s)]
*  I was like my confidence has never been lower [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2172.42s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on here and then he like coached me through that a bit [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2173.94s)]
*  But if I didn't take it upon myself to go hey, man [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2176.98s)]
*  Yeah, I this is a big opportunity and I know it and I need help [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2179.46s)]
*  But it's just a constant like we don't give a fuck you sink or you swim [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2182.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2187.06s)]
*  And I think it's like they do that because they need you to be like a strong-minded person because they spend all this money on these [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2187.54s)]
*  On these things on these like sketches. I mean our punks and if you break or you fuck up [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2194.66s)]
*  Like if they if whatever at some point if some famous person knows you're punking them [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2200.42s)]
*  You just lost the company so much money [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2205.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so you have to like they I think they have to kind of fuck around with you to see if you can sort of [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2208.7400000000002s)]
*  Handle it. Yeah, you know because I i'm not gonna trust some kid [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2213.62s)]
*  I just met two days ago with essentially some of these things were like really high production [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2217.38s)]
*  It's like 400 500 thousand dollars on a production of like some wild thing [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2222.82s)]
*  It's like bro, we have to know that you can that you can like handle a heat or whatever [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2226.98s)]
*  Sorry, I was gonna you know, you finished the point. I was just gonna say like I I would have I would have handled it differently [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2231.94s)]
*  I think you can middle like middle of the road it. Yeah [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2238.34s)]
*  You know, but I mean, I don't know. That's what I did it and this show was [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2242.5s)]
*  You know stupid successful. So they obviously know what the fuck they're doing. Sure. But when you're doing sketches, are you bullying everybody? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2245.86s)]
*  I'm too much of a pussy man. I need to all we're going to speak up like, you know, that's fine [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2252.42s)]
*  We'll just go with that edit [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2255.78s)]
*  You have a creative vision. It's very different [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2258.1000000000004s)]
*  But that's why I like I got two guys that work with on a day to day and it's just tight [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2260.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just boom boom boom. Now your videos are great, but there's very few straight to camera [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2264.02s)]
*  There's like a handful of straight to camera people that I think is funny one indie kid named sahib sing funny [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2267.5400000000004s)]
*  You know, uh, your sketches are funny and then ryan davis who I think you know [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2272.1000000000004s)]
*  He'll just talk to the camera and it's like vlog type shit, but it's so good with very few edits [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2275.78s)]
*  Which is really impressive people like your shit. I will laugh at a lot. Thank you so much, man [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2280.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because people just want to be talked to yeah, you know, it's like this one be like in there [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2283.7799999999997s)]
*  How do you decide what the thing is? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2287.9399999999996s)]
*  Because you'll have the most random shit and it'll be so funny like the guy who never left his hometown is one of your [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2290.5s)]
*  Biggest videos on youtube. Yeah, and it's so funny and I guess that makes some sense [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2295.14s)]
*  But there's some like the kyle guys named kyle. Yeah, yeah, that was timing that was timing [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2299.7s)]
*  People the guys named kyle were starting a lot of shit, but nobody made a video on it [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2304.4199999999996s)]
*  So I just kind of like saw this like starting to bubble [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2307.7799999999997s)]
*  I think every like big video turned out like a wave and it's like if you start like tiger king [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2309.8599999999997s)]
*  I made a video right right when that kind of hit and i'm not like a trend chaser too much [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2312.9s)]
*  But the same with the white cloth shit if you get it right before it breaks [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2316.9s)]
*  You're the first to break it. I mean [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2320.26s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt the white cloth thing for people who don't know trevor and I remember you tell me about this [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2323.14s)]
*  I knew him I knew you threw him for years before he met correct [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2326.6600000000003s)]
*  But trevor when white cloths was popping he made a shirt that said there are no laws [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2329.62s)]
*  There ain't no laws in drinking cloth ain't no laws when you're drinking cloth [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2334.1s)]
*  It's sold crazy who's from the video that you made and then they sued him stupid season to say [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2336.58s)]
*  He had to stop selling the shirts immediately give back all the money. I made yeah, they're a piece of [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2341.62s)]
*  Apparently his his profile I heard you say on another podcast went crazy after that [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2345.8599999999997s)]
*  Like it was it was like a catch 22. I don't even know what that means, but I think it was [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2349.2999999999997s)]
*  one of those were like [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2353.7799999999997s)]
*  So they saw the video and then they're like let's talk wednesday to talk about a potential brand deal, right? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2355.46s)]
*  And I go all right cool, but the video's boom right now. I'm a fucking i'm a business guy [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2359.62s)]
*  I'm like 25 this point. I'm just hopped up on adderall. I'm like, let's get these t-shirts out, right? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2363.22s)]
*  I had a guy alter the logo slightly put it up on sale monday morning and it sold like 7 000 t-shirts in like 48 [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2366.74s)]
*  Hours. Yep. There it is. That's probably out of fucking mall kiosk in west palm beach right now [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2372.42s)]
*  This is this is still everywhere dude everywhere people have that tattooed on them. Yeah [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2377.06s)]
*  I'd say i've seen at least how did you know and again? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2382.1s)]
*  This is this i spoke to gabe asking him things about you and he said trevor is brilliant [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2384.58s)]
*  At knowing when a trend like what's gonna be viral. He's really good at that [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2389.94s)]
*  I also think sorry to cut you off dude. I also think the other piece of your genius though is to pick [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2393.94s)]
*  Things that are so nuanced that I don't think people make videos on right, but I think so you can be original still [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2400.1s)]
*  It's a yes. It's it's originality. But also it's like this thing. We're like [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2406.1s)]
*  The how do I say it's like you pick a thing that like it that seems nuanced, but everyone goes [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2409.94s)]
*  Oh, no, I relate to that [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2415.62s)]
*  But it's like such a small thing, but everyone still relates to the spider [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2417.2200000000003s)]
*  Specificity specificity and commons always funny if you go like I was banging the chicken a restaurant [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2423.94s)]
*  That's whatever you I was banging chicken a buffalo wild wings it like the specific [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2427.78s)]
*  And your videos are very specific exactly [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2431.86s)]
*  So like I did a video about guys who drive subarus that could have just been guys who are mountain men nature guys [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2433.62s)]
*  But it's like it's too broad, but you define it [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2439.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like how is this how somebody gonna tag their friend in this make dude? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2441.46s)]
*  This is you or this is deborah who drives this shit, right? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2444.58s)]
*  So it's like it's getting that angle the white club one is random [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2447.62s)]
*  I made an hour and a half on my friend chad [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2449.78s)]
*  I was living at home at his apartment and that was a random one and then I was literally i'm just [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2452.42s)]
*  So how my shit's written half its rift and I was like what rhymes with law with clause? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2457.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm flicking take a letter off laws [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2461.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2463.78s)]
*  I just said that and that just hit and that was all the quotes in the videos and I can always that's what I do [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2464.1000000000004s)]
*  For my videos if I'll do like a seven or five minute video or whatever and then what to post on the one minute [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=2468.34s)]

*  So i'm not acting like but when blau would bomb [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3541.46s)]
*  It would be the funniest thing because it'd be the biggest fucking act outs and there would be no laugh [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3544.18s)]
*  And then you would know he's melting down inside and he had this this dragon act [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3548.9s)]
*  But the couple times it bombed it was the funniest fucking thing. Oh, dude, didn't you guys? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3559.06s)]

*  So funny stand up new york comedy club in new york on the upper west side. I used to be there a lot [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3568.82s)]
*  And they started a content house called stand up labs [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3573.86s)]
*  They came to me and they're like, hey, do you want to do something? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3576.5s)]
*  I was like sure i'm broke who gives a fuck and they were like prank shows do really well [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3579.06s)]
*  And I was like i'm not that interested in doing like a prank for different people [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3584.1800000000003s)]
*  Buh, buh, buh, and then they they're kind of like we think it could do well [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3587.54s)]
*  So i'm like, you know, it could be funny if instead of [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3589.78s)]
*  Pranking [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3592.42s)]
*  Uh like four people an episode you just prank one guy like four times [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3593.38s)]
*  And just make him think his life is falling apart. Okay [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3597.54s)]
*  And then they're like do you have somebody you'd like to do that to and I was like I happen to [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3599.86s)]
*  Now we didn't get to finish because the first prank was so devastating and someone blew it but thank god that someone blew our cover [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3604.7400000000002s)]
*  But thank god because the first prank was so devastating that if we had carried through bottom, I might have really killed himself [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3610.7400000000002s)]
*  Um cared through if I didn't find out at the end of that set that it was a prank so the I would have got on the [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3616.9s)]
*  a train [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3622.34s)]

*  And again getting past that clubs, especially back then was a huge deal [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3631.46s)]
*  So I did say you guys need to pass blau [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3634.66s)]
*  We'll prank him and then you can pass him after but the prank was call him in for an audition [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3637.62s)]
*  And i'm gonna tell the audience and we have it on tape I said guys you have it today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3642.66s)]

*  We never showed this because blau put his two dates under and then show every every 30 second show [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3663.3799999999997s)]
*  here's the thing we didn't play before because blau was it was like dude if [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3667.7799999999997s)]
*  People's first exposure to blau is him not doing well [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3671.78s)]
*  It might subconsciously plant the idea that he's not funny now blau has so many fucking millions of views [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3674.82s)]
*  That this clip is and it's also dude 12 years ago. Look at my face [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3680.82s)]
*  I look young but like i'm a baby in that what is going on [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3685.78s)]
*  So they're putting up a gopro on stage. So I tell the audience and and blau I know for a fact [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3689.54s)]
*  Which is what's more fucked up. I know for a fact this like you can tell when it's a blau audience [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3695.38s)]
*  You just feel it i'm hosting and i'm like blau would fucking crush he would level the room [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3699.54s)]
*  and so I have to like [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3704.1s)]
*  I was like I need to like really tell them like make sure they know [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3706.58s)]
*  Like three times. I was like guys again. I told him when he comes up here do not react at all [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3710.5s)]
*  What does the blau audience look like? They're just you can tell when they like bigger act outs a little bit [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3714.66s)]
*  When they like little things like that, you can just feel they're like, uh, a little they don't they like they like [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3719.3s)]
*  Yeah, they like like performative shit like in l.a crowds. They want bigger. They want bigger performance [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3724.1s)]
*  And I could feel that from them and they weren't like they didn't love the super dark like whatever [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3728.82s)]
*  So I was like blau would level the room. So I was like guys i'm gonna call it [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3733.3s)]
*  There's a good friend of mine, but just do not laugh at anything. He says don't boo. Don't heckle. Just stay silent [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=3736.1s)]

*  I remember they'd be calling me up at eastfield is the only club I was passed at other than st. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=4538.9s)]

*  Self-doubt thought even the fucking i'm annoyed at how hacky that thought is but then the second they didn't laugh [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=4551.28s)]
*  I would be like, oh shit [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=4556.34s)]
*  They're finding out and I would start talking faster and cussing more and overcompensating [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=4557.22s)]
*  And I would hear it back when you listen to your sets and I would hate that and I couldn't figure out what it was [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=4561.7s)]

*  in like two months dog like and and I think that [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5741.54s)]
*  Your ability to handle all of that was very [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5746.660000000001s)]
*  Uh was very like inspiring honestly because I think a lot of people couldn't handle that [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5750.5s)]
*  That type of rise that fast and so I think those moments that you were having [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5756.099999999999s)]
*  During that rise were just because you were trying to handle and process all this shit [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5761.94s)]
*  Yeah, and sometimes that moment was the built up correct [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5767.54s)]
*  And it's like dude, I was I was there for every moment of that and until you're crying dude [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5770.0199999999995s)]
*  I think you handled it very very well because a lot of people [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5775.139999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't have dog like it's not like this slow stantom success blah blah blah [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5779.860000000001s)]
*  You went from literally people being like, oh, I kind of know that guy fine to like the biggest internet person in two months [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5784.26s)]
*  I remember him. It was insane. Don't want to start stiff stop [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5791.54s)]
*  He's telling me about it [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5794.58s)]
*  And then he was like, I mean this guy's just blowing the fuck up and I hadn't heard about you yet [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5795.78s)]
*  But then it was no we started the thing before yeah before that but it was but it was like right before that [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5798.900000000001s)]
*  So I was with you. We started like pockets maybe two months three months before [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5804.18s)]
*  The I think it might have been the white [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5808.26s)]
*  I was about the way we connected [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5810.34s)]
*  I was about to quit my job and you were doing college gigs and college gigs are paying you like two to three k at [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5812.82s)]
*  The time and at that point I was like, bro, that's like three months rent santa monica [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5817.78s)]
*  So like and then I was telling them how I was selling merch through videos [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5821.14s)]
*  And we both connected on that. I was like you told me I had to do college gigs [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5824.98s)]
*  I'll tell you how to do video stuff. Yeah, remember and we just both like connected on that [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5827.62s)]
*  But yeah, I also think just like doing like open mics years and years and years like that's just like hammered in my head [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5831.14s)]
*  That like you ain't shit, you know [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5835.3s)]
*  So I think kids get like an ego because they're just normal normal normal they get a big pop in videos now [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5836.74s)]
*  They're that guy right? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5840.900000000001s)]
*  so I think just like [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5842.5s)]
*  That watching guys like kev and watching people like I had like I had a lot of videos pop in the back end slow [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5843.7s)]
*  Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5848.900000000001s)]
*  And then when it really really hit that's when I was like, okay like it like it felt overnight [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5850.34s)]
*  But for me it was been like i've been posting videos for like [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5854.58s)]
*  Three to four years so it was like steady steady steady [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5857.54s)]
*  But but you still handle a lot of people don't and I don't know if you said you inspired by this [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5860.02s)]
*  I I was and I this is so i'm gonna give schultz his flowers. Oh, he's not here [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5864.0199999999995s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, I never get jealous of him [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5868.179999999999s)]
*  But sometimes we'll get insecure like man [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5869.86s)]
*  Am I gonna why it's taking me so long or whatever and then I really think [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5871.139999999999s)]
*  I get to watch andrew do it and I get to see how he handles himself [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5874.66s)]
*  And that to me has been such a lesson and like this guy [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5877.54s)]
*  Has never been too too famous to take a picture with anybody [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5880.9s)]
*  He's never been too famous to not give somebody his best version of himself [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5883.7s)]
*  And so you'll hear stories of other celebrities being dickheads and might think that's okay [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5887.139999999999s)]
*  But I got this example of this guy that's like no man you do it. That's what you do [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5891.38s)]
*  You take the picture you do whatever [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5895.22s)]
*  Yeah [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5896.58s)]
*  And so I do feel like it's so cool that I get to learn that from him and i'm curious what y'all learn from each other [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5896.900000000001s)]
*  Because maybe you've learned that from him. I don't know. Yeah, I mean that's literally exactly what you said man. Just like watching [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5901.9400000000005s)]

*  Just like took on all the success that fast as professionally [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5910.58s)]
*  Professional as you were during all the success was inspiring but also like I did learn a lot where it's just like [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=5915.3s)]

*  Listen, you guys are somehow fine. The only videographer who's also a security [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9700.92s)]

*  Can I tell you something no, he [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9727.48s)]
*  Also, no, he won't yeah, I know this guy I will not hey i'll lower it [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9730.279999999999s)]
*  But i'll give you a gun. Yeah [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9735.72s)]
*  Um, listen, I just I there is a lot of fear in not having money again [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9738.039999999999s)]
*  And I think that my mindset is still stuck four years ago. Have you talked to on [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9743.24s)]
*  Publicly about like how broke you everything? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes. I have yes lift. Yes [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9747.880000000001s)]
*  This guy after punked 28 was it what year [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9755.48s)]
*  I moved to la party 2019. So it was like 2018 [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9759.880000000001s)]
*  Something like that before that. What was your lift rating? [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9764.04s)]
*  That's a great this guy drove lifting but like he he said it to me one time. He didn't even tell me that's where I know him [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9766.84s)]
*  Damn you bitch [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9773.72s)]
*  But that's the kind of shit so he didn't even tell me this until recently [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9776.36s)]
*  I knew him and I think we might have been going broke together [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9779.24s)]
*  But like for him it was probably even more of a mind fuck you were on punked you had this pop and then it's gone [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9781.56s)]
*  Which I had too. But anyway, he was like, uh, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9786.68s)]
*  I was driving lift around la like paralyzed with fear that a fucking comic would get into one of my lifts and be like [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9790.04s)]
*  Holy shit, blah [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9796.2s)]
*  And then you just got to deal with that and it's like you got this tv credit blah blah blah [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9797.56s)]
*  So that's a fucking another reason I didn't know if you were saying it publicly but early on was like i'm so proud of how far [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9800.84s)]
*  You've come that's the shit. I I don't remember that part, but I remember that part of his life [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9805.56s)]
*  But I feel like I feel in la it's not as big of a deal because like most of the actors there are [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9810.04s)]
*  Like waiters and waitresses [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9816.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think kind of I feel like it's like in that world in my head. It was a [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9818.84s)]
*  I hear your point. I think in my head it was a little different because it was like [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9823.960000000001s)]
*  The punk thing was such a major like it was like a nationwide search for the comics are gonna be on the shit [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9827.4s)]
*  Right, so we didn't know you were on there bro. Yeah, no, no doubt. I love you [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9833.800000000001s)]
*  No doubt, man. No doubt [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9837.960000000001s)]
*  No doubt [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9845.0s)]
*  anyway, but my point is is like [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9846.28s)]
*  So to to get that and then to have that ride and then go down to zero [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9849.0s)]
*  I think there was a lot of like and it might have not existed but in my head there was like these optics [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9855.0s)]
*  Towards me or whatever and again it might have been surrounding because you're used to being on set [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9860.44s)]
*  They're like your talent get whatever you want. Here's food. Then somebody gets in like can we turn the ac down a little bit? Yeah [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9864.28s)]
*  How's it the carton? [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9870.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was it was such a it was such a my fuck so [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9872.12s)]
*  Uh, and again, it might have just I might have just been making it up [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9875.4s)]
*  But in my head it was like I fucking woke up at like six in the morning [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9879.16s)]
*  To drive people because in my head I was like, oh comics aren't up this late [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9883.4s)]
*  I'm sorry up this early. So I drive from six in the morning [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9887.24s)]
*  It's like four or like probably three or four pm and then do like open mics [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9889.64s)]
*  And I was like deep in the game at this point [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9893.880000000001s)]
*  and so the whole point of me even saying any of this is like [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9896.28s)]
*  That's where my mindset was and so to actually have money now. It's like I don't ever want to go back there [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9899.72s)]
*  So that's why I think i'm innately cheap obviously, but I think it's one it accentuates it because of that [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9905.0s)]
*  No, that makes perfect sense for sure you are innately cheap, but I get how that's more of a mind fuck [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9910.04s)]
*  But also at a certain point you got to let go a bit now. Maybe I let go too much [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9914.2s)]
*  I don't know probably we're still thinking with your brain [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9917.240000000002s)]
*  You're pretty cheap too. I will spend no he's crazy to me. Is he not crazy to you? [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9920.36s)]
*  He spends money like crazy. That's because he's [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9925.400000000001s)]
*  They they [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9929.080000000002s)]
*  Andrew likes watches and then all of a sudden he likes watches actually I liked watches first was broke [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9930.68s)]
*  But I didn't know you could I also didn't know you could collect them my cousin is obsessed with watches [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9935.72s)]
*  But not even on like what's gonna appreciate in value. He like loves the movement of it. He I was I went to a day [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9940.52s)]
*  He's good. Yeah, dude. Yeah, yeah, I went to ap he and it's like hard to get access to in ap at all and uh [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9946.84s)]
*  Shouts to my guy aloo that hooked it up. But my cousin is like he's trying to get such a watch guy [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9954.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I always I always shout him out when I can my cousin is such a watch guy [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9959.24s)]
*  He's like impressing the ap guy about his brightling. He's like, oh it has a nabbit timer [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9962.12s)]
*  This is how you work it if you're in the air, buh buh buh guys fascinated so impressed [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9966.28s)]
*  And he says to my cousin you ever think about becoming a part of the ap family, which is like you don't get asked [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9970.2s)]
*  And then my cousin goes I'd probably just get a used vintage one [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9975.08s)]
*  That's what I like if I had the choice like he couldn't care less about the appreciation and getting asked [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9978.04s)]
*  He likes the movement and the look of the vintage and that's what he likes and that rubbed off on me a bit [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9982.6s)]
*  But then when I found out you can like this this thing appreciates in value. I was like, fuck. Yeah, let's do that [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9987.08s)]
*  Absolutely. So that's where I was like, oh watches are great. That's they look fly. You can you get the right one [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9992.5s)]
*  You can appreciate in value. Yeah, but I will also spend on a lot of things [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=9997.640000000001s)]
*  I'll cheap out on certain things but I mean all living in a nice place is like that's so interesting that you feel like he's cheap [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10001.320000000002s)]
*  Because I feel like he spends money like insane [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10008.52s)]
*  So maybe I just like the what I love value right dad. I'm obsessed with whatever I pay [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10011.640000000001s)]
*  I want to get the best shit for it. I don't mind paying but it's got to be the best [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10017.0s)]
*  I'm like a weirdly obsessive about that. I just remember us having a convo here about [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10020.6s)]
*  Who tips the worst? I remember this I came and andrews are [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10025.32s)]
*  Used to be bad tippers. I think now they're forced to be good tippers because they're too like [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10029.960000000001s)]
*  Where are you at? [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10034.68s)]
*  Percentage I'm much more generous now. Actually, what's his name? The Hassan abi? I don't know [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10036.04s)]
*  I was talking to him. I was like, yeah, I could tip I wasn't I got better as I stopped being broke [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10040.92s)]
*  I used to really be bad when I was broke. I I mean I tip I took the worst one standing up, you know [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10044.76s)]
*  Anyplace where I gotta be like you were on the pod you said you were gonna stop tipping [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10049.08s)]
*  Did you play like four years ago? Just me and you and we opened on it. Yeah, I can't but now it's annoying [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10052.76s)]
*  And people know who you are. So it's like you want to not of course, but you're like fuck [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10058.84s)]
*  If i'm out of leslie's pool supply and you hit me with this shit [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10063.24s)]

*  You know, yeah [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10075.08s)]
*  I'm just trying to get out of that screen as quick as possible percentage kills me [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10076.68s)]
*  So my bro you're making my coffee, which I really appreciate [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10079.560000000001s)]
*  Let me give you a dollar but you hit me with the percentage of 20 percent and also coffee is now eight dollars [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10082.84s)]
*  So you're giving me with the 20 of eight dollars. I'm tipping you a dollar 60 [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qVu8KgKZE&t=10089.32s)]
