# Cody Rhodes on Roman Reigns “Beef”, Finishing Fathers Legacy, & Vince McMahon Story
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c)
*  One of the most magical things I've ever seen is The Undertaker showing up to chokeslam the ring. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=0.0s)]
*  In the moment, I'm laying in the corner, so I see this man roll in the ring like a wild animal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5.04s)]
*  But then, no one sees this. He looked over at me and just went... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=10.56s)]
*  And as soon as he winked, I kid you not, the lights went out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  And he escaped. And I thought like, oh, he's magical, you know? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=17.68s)]
*  Did anything go wrong? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=22.48s)]
*  Everything went wrong. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=23.76s)]
*  Is it true that Vince flies to your house to pitch you on coming to WWE? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=25.36s)]
*  He scribbled on a piece of paper the amount of money the contract would be for and just slid it across. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=30.48s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=34.72s)]
*  15 times more than what I had been making. I always say like it's a peck well spent. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I kept my jacket on the whole day and I remember like Michael Hayes, he asked to see it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=40.24s)]
*  I started to unzip my jacket a little bit and he goes, no, no, no, save it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=44.64s)]
*  Did you feel like you were spearheading it or do you feel like there was other... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=48.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=52.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=53.06s)]
*  I can't talk that shit. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=53.56s)]
*  White meat baby first. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=54.56s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flaygrain. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=56.96s)]
*  Today, we are joined by the motherfucking champ, man, Cody Rose is in the building. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Wow. Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=63.36s)]
*  As I was saying to you before the pod, you know, we are guys that were very much wrestling casuals, okay? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=65.92s)]
*  In my younger life, obviously, there are certain waves that you couldn't escape it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=72.72s)]
*  But it wasn't like I grew up here in the city. It wasn't like [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=77.28s)]
*  I felt ostracized if I wasn't completely locked in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=81.36s)]
*  Vince Doc comes out. It's like mind blowing. It's one of the most amazing things that I've seen on TV. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=85.52s)]
*  Like it truly is incredible. I feel like left out. I feel like I missed 20 years of reflection of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=90.56s)]
*  American culture through wrestling. And I think it really portrays wrestling as incredibly high brow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=97.12s)]
*  And a lot of times the people that don't watch it, I think think it's low brow. The people that do [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=104.0s)]
*  watch it understand it for the story and this reflection of culture. And I think the doc like [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=109.12s)]
*  smashed them together. I love that you referred to as high brow. Okay. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=114.72s)]
*  Because in terms of pro wrestling, sports entertainment, however you look at it, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=119.36s)]
*  whichever generation you popped in, if you were a fan, if you weren't a fan, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=123.36s)]
*  there is a reason that I wear a suit everywhere I go. There is a reason I try to represent wrestling [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=127.04s)]
*  at the highest level. It's because having my dad in it, that was a unique conversation as a kid [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=133.84s)]
*  with, Hey, what does your dad do? Or when you meet their parents, what does your dad do? And my dad [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=140.56s)]
*  told me, I feel bad even when he told me this, even at a young age, I thought no way. But he told me, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=145.2s)]
*  he goes, Hey, if you want to tell people I'm a salesman, that's okay. And I thought like, no, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=150.24s)]
*  no. Oh, because he thought you might be embarrassed. People would judge him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=156.4s)]
*  Not everyone says high brow. So when I try to engage with people or meet people, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=161.36s)]
*  or even the classic on a flight, what do you do for a living? I want to make sure they leave. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=166.72s)]
*  And they're not thinking, it's not the best example, but they're not thinking macho madness [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=171.28s)]
*  all the time. Like I'm not sitting there snapping into Slim Jims. That's all awesome and wonderful. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=178.16s)]
*  And it was for the time amazing, one of the greater performers ever. But I want them to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  understand that it is a very large business. If it makes you feel any better, you know what [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=187.2s)]
*  magic made me realize that was when I saw your WrestleMania going crazy on Twitter, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=191.44s)]
*  I started watching the last five minutes of it. My brother broke down the whole story. My brother's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=196.56s)]
*  big wrestling fan. And I was like, Oh, this is some of the greatest storytelling I've ever heard of. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=199.92s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get into like your whole full story, because that's kind of insane how it's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  culminated. But there is one thing that I want to like fast forward and ask you about. There's this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=209.6s)]
*  term that we learn when we're watching the doc and everybody probably already knows this. So a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=214.4s)]
*  lot of the parlance I'm going to use is going to seem like pedestrian to you. But to us, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=218.16s)]
*  we'll learn about. So Babyface, right? Yes. Are you the first unanimously supported Babyface [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  since Hulk Hogan? I'm knocking on, I think that's wood. I've been very lucky. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  But can you maybe even describe what that means? Babyface, I mean, Babyface is a good guy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=237.76s)]
*  Babyface is a good guy. Heel is a bad guy. Those two terms are usually used pretty correctly. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=242.72s)]
*  Some of the other terms you'll feel that it's always good being a casual fan, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  because some of the most hardcore fans will start throwing these terms around and they're, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  no, that's not the use of it. We don't talk that way. But Babyface, a good guy, I've been very [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  lucky that something about my return set in with all the different demographics in a way where [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=263.68s)]
*  there's usually a good chunk of fans who rally against the Babyface as well. Well, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  I like the bad guys. Something happened and I'll give him the first person who really let me [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=276.56s)]
*  in on it that this is wild. There's no one going against this. This is wild. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=282.32s)]
*  Was a Hall of Famer, Mr. Paul Heyman, who without giving me credit in a moment, gave me a lot of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=287.6s)]
*  credit. He said, you've opened the door for traditional Babyfaces to come back. Yeah, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=294.48s)]
*  I was apparently post-Stone Cold or whatever. It was always an edgy good guy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=299.84s)]
*  Stone Cold, even. It was the anti-hero. The more I try to watch and analyze wrestling, I'm like, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  wrestling is this reflection of whatever Americans are rebelling against. So the Hogan area is maybe [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=310.96s)]
*  like, this is the rebellion against the guy who wears the suit and does everything proper and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=317.28s)]
*  has the family and the dog in the yard. And then Hogan's like, fuck that, I do whatever I want. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  Exciting. Then once you have that guy as the good guy, the rebellion is the guy who doesn't [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  really give a fuck. And you see this anti-heroes pop in the Stone Cold. But you're pure Babyface. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=332.88s)]
*  The term we use is white meat Babyface. And by the time this comes out, I don't know if that will... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=342.48s)]
*  It's very risky. I would never be mad if I started to hear the boos. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=351.12s)]
*  Things would have to change a little bit. You'd have to pivot. But my model in the industry and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=358.0s)]
*  a guy I drove around for a few years, God bless him, one of the best locker room leaders the company [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=362.56s)]
*  ever had was John Cena. John is the virtuous, the goodest of good, but he had a really unique thing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=367.04s)]
*  with the audience where half the people were there to see him win and the other half were there to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=374.0s)]
*  see him lose. And that still means they're all here for John. They didn't realize it at the time [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=377.84s)]
*  because he told me once, he goes, if they're chanting, let's go Cena, Cena sucks. Well, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  I feel bad for the other guy in the ring with me. And then they found moments where like CM Punk and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  him would wrestle against each other. And they started chanting for CM Punk. And that's where [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  you started to realize, okay, guys are starting to click. They're starting to get to his level. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, no, the Babyface is a wild thing. But again, tonight I'm at Barclays. I could walk out there [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  and it could all end. It could all end. So I don't take it for granted. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=403.6s)]
*  What do you think makes you, what do you think? Was it anything you did intentionally? Was it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=407.44s)]
*  just something that happened wrestling with the Peck or whatever? What do you think it was that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=411.36s)]
*  really flipped everyone? The story, you know, we went into WrestleMania 40, we said we got to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=414.16s)]
*  finish the story. Everything about what I have done and my return to WWE and where I went, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=419.92s)]
*  all of that is real. So when our industry is at its best, it's when you're just reflecting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=426.56s)]
*  real. And that's not always easy if you're playing like an astronaut or a really crazy, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=430.96s)]
*  out there character or Stardust, for example. But when you were telling them and telling them [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  willing and in existence, first promo I did returning to WWE was on Raw and no one looked [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  at it. Not a single writer. Nobody asked. They had a full trust in what I was going to be [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  saying. Here's the time, please hit this time. And I just wanted to will it in existence. Here's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=452.24s)]
*  the story. My dad held this up in the garden in the late seventies. Then due to the nature of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=456.96s)]
*  pro wrestling, he didn't get to leave with the title. And at eight years old, you don't know [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=462.64s)]
*  the difference between what's real, what isn't real. I just looked at it and I wanted it. I [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=466.32s)]
*  wanted it for him and just told him that story. And I think that's the thing that maybe people [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=470.56s)]
*  identify with is that it's real because so many things go against traditional baby face. Like [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  wearing a suit and tie is not baby face. That's that's Ric Flair. That's flaunting your wealth, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=482.0s)]
*  all that. But none of it's mattered at this point. And there's always people like they're [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=488.08s)]
*  going to start booing them soon. They're going to start booing them soon. At this point, you've [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=492.56s)]
*  been saying it for three years. Like, of course you're right now. I feel like what is white meat, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=495.12s)]
*  baby face is earning your spot. Sure. And everything about your name should show you [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=502.72s)]
*  you're a nepo baby. You did all these. That's right. Anybody else a nepo baby? Or no, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=511.92s)]
*  everyone's in the game. I mean, we're all born in America in the greatest time of the empire. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=517.04s)]
*  So we've got a couple of advantages. But is there not one nepo higher in the whole operation? Not [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=520.72s)]
*  one? Not a brother, a cousin? There's a lot of cronyism. Well, I will say it's all crony. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=527.92s)]
*  It's all crony. We're all friends. None of it merit. If you bring in a family member, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=532.88s)]
*  I bet you they do really well. Yes. I believe in the nepo babies. Oh, I can't wait to nepo [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=537.04s)]
*  my daughter into whatever. Yes. But my point is, I think this is at least again outside casual [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=541.92s)]
*  perspective. But I think the idea was you really earned it. And I think people are looking at their [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=548.48s)]
*  lives and maybe they're not feeling like they have the opportunity to do certain things. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=553.76s)]
*  And you just kind of want to see somebody who deserves it get the shot once. And I think they [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=558.48s)]
*  can root for that. But before we get into that, I want to go to the beginning because this is, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=565.6s)]
*  okay, I watched your father's Hall of Fame induction speech. Oh, gosh. Okay. You come out, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  I think I became a Cody crybaby in that moment. Yeah, that's my first time on camera for the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  company. I worked for him at the time. I don't know if you guys see this, but it's unbelievable. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=582.88s)]
*  So this is your first time on camera. Do you have aspirations of getting in the business when you go [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=587.28s)]
*  up there? Yeah. Okay, so you're going up there. So I'm already working for WWE at the time. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=592.48s)]
*  But nobody else knows nobody. I've been in developmental. I just yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=597.04s)]
*  Great. Great. Great. Okay. So this is the introduction of the next generation, obviously [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=601.6s)]
*  your brother, but the last, I guess, generation of Rhodes in the business. And you do this amazing, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=607.28s)]
*  like I got a little like emotional at the end of it. He'd be a Hall of Fame father if there was a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=613.36s)]
*  man he would. Yeah. It's the that's so that people look at that. And they always ask like, gosh, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=617.44s)]
*  bring that, you know, you have these speaking times where you do something with it's a promo [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  and interview and they bring that sometimes you can't bring that because I wasn't talking [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  about anything artificial. Yeah. So how do you really this is my father. This is an easy one, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  guys. Yeah. You know, this is real. Like there are plenty of times we're talking about something [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=637.36s)]
*  that's like, very fabricated and we're creating a narrative. That one was as simple as could be [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  set the bar very high because I really worked on it. Yeah. I wanted I was going to be in front of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=646.56s)]
*  some of my favorite wrestlers, some of my peers, my bosses. Yeah. I really worked on it. And my [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  brother, I hadn't seen him in quite some time, but he know what you were going to say. No, he felt [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=656.9599999999999s)]
*  like really touched when you gave him. Oh, yeah. I always try to impress Dustin with my professionalism [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  and I only give him a little the best in wrestling. Give him a little hint. Yeah. I might say this, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=670.8s)]
*  this might happen. Don't give him the full deal. You know, yeah, that was a really significant [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=674.88s)]
*  moment. I had that moment, though, also caused a little bit of an issue. I wasn't ready to come up [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=679.68s)]
*  yet. Wasn't good. I had like, the like body wasn't there yet. I didn't have the audience wanted it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  So you've got to give them what they want. And the downfall being a nepo baby, like, oh, this is easy. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=692.08s)]
*  He bring him out. It was with his dad. And it's the whole that's the downfall. The door is wide open. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=696.56s)]
*  The money is right there. Some others are struggling for it. But then the idea is like, well, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=701.76s)]
*  in some people's eyes, your dad's a Mount Rushmore guy. Good luck. And then that's that point. I [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=707.04s)]
*  wasn't ready at all, but I'm so thankful I came up when I did because I mean, I literally grew up in [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  front of the audience. That might be another reason why they took to everything. I grew up in front [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=717.12s)]
*  of them. Okay. Yeah. So you start, you're doing pretty good in W. But not like superstardom. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=721.12s)]
*  I wouldn't even say I'm doing pretty good. Don't you in the Intercontinental? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=727.76s)]
*  So yeah, that's along the way I had. So what I'll call them is small bones. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=730.24s)]
*  I feel like anyone in entertainment gets this, like the opportunities that you want, the biggest [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  opportunity. You want this, you want that. Your dreams are what they are. But at the time it was [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=738.48s)]
*  a little bones. Hey, here's the Intercontinental Championship, which by no means is a little bone, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=743.6s)]
*  but it wasn't something at the time they were really featuring or spotlighting. Gunther recently [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=748.08s)]
*  had it and it was such a bigger deal there. But anyways, it was little moments like that, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  that they'd kind of fill your gas tank up. And then it was highs and lows, man. Highs and lows [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=758.7199999999999s)]
*  wrestling, especially if they've not, and I don't want to say they, but if a company, like any [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=764.64s)]
*  company in entertainment, like any show that they're involved in, you have to pick who's your number [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=769.36s)]
*  one. Who's your number two? Like who, who's number one on the call sheet? Who are we investing in? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=772.88s)]
*  It still is a show. Who was number one at the time? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  Gosh, Intercontinental Championship. No. Oh yeah, yeah. I'd say, I'd say John still was. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=779.6s)]
*  John's number one. John's the guy. And then everything trickles [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=784.24s)]
*  down from that. And yeah, so it was, it was these moments like that that validated me and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=787.44s)]
*  made me feel good. But at a certain point after that, I realized I was very much blocked in. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  They didn't see me growing. I mean, I was a child. I was 20 years old when I went to OVW to be [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=799.84s)]
*  in developmental. Couldn't order a drink. Like 20 years old. Didn't know anything about anything. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  My dad didn't train me either. Didn't want to train me. So this was me just doing it with [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  everyone assuming I knew what I was doing. But yeah. Why didn't he want to train you? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=815.52s)]
*  He was really good about, hey, you want to do this? Great. I want you to be the best. And he was [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=820.0s)]
*  confident that I could do well, but he didn't want to touch it because he felt if he did anything, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=826.64s)]
*  he even left, he was on the writing team at the time for SmackDown. He left the writing team [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  before I got called up because he actually went to Full Sail or Lando and started that. He didn't, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  he thought it would be against me if he spoke out in any way like, well, Cody should do this. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=840.72s)]
*  It's a conflict of interest. Conflict of interest, for sure. And there are some dads, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=845.9200000000001s)]
*  I've seen it work both ways, who are so in on their kids. So in. And it works just as well. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=849.28s)]
*  But our strategy worked the same. It did. That was the best. He had never had to push for me. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=855.0400000000001s)]
*  He never had to be in an awkward conversation or anything like that. He let me just do it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=860.0s)]
*  Okay. So what, are they feeding you storylines? And then what is the process? And this during [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=863.36s)]
*  the harder time? What is the process when you get a storyline that you don't fuck with at all? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=869.44s)]
*  Well, it's like, I refer to them as the little battles. Again, it's not our sandbox. So [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=874.96s)]
*  whoever's ever promoting, booking, whoever it may be, like right now Triple H is in charge of the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=880.96s)]
*  creative. I love that because most of the things that Triple H says, yes, great. I will run that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=885.7600000000001s)]
*  play. All you can do in that position is say, hey, I don't love this. What about this? You always [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=892.08s)]
*  should have an alternative to that's something that when you're younger, you don't realize. You [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=898.16s)]
*  can't just say no. Can't just say this sucks. Hey, I don't love this. But what about this? How do [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  you manage up? How do you influence your own storylines? And what I tell me about the little [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=906.88s)]
*  battles every day is you can only most of them, you won't win, but you'll feel much better going [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=910.56s)]
*  home. If you at least fought the little battle, if you said, Hey, I don't want to say this. And [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=915.8399999999999s)]
*  then it becomes a, Hey, we really need you to say this. All right. Well, at least set it versus [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  letting it all bottle up. Oh, I hate everybody. And you're just all that angst and all that. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=924.32s)]
*  Cause that happened to me during Stardust during the younger run. I wasn't speaking up. So they [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  change your character to Stardust. So you and your brother can kind of be this unit. And it's awful, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=933.36s)]
*  man. Yeah, awful. And it actually was okay. Like crowds were kind of fun with it. We won the tag [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  titles. There's some significant moments, but it was you. It just wasn't. God, man. It was just so. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  It's like if the Williams sisters only got to play doubles. You know what I mean? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=951.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. I think at the time I learned this from when I went away is absolutely some of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  the behind the scenes aspects out of my control weren't my fault. And this was something I had [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=963.8399999999999s)]
*  been tasked to do. And I did give it my 110%. However, I found that a lot of it was on me. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  A lot of it. So wrestling is the suspension of disbelief and it's entertainment. There's, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=978.88s)]
*  you know, we have writers, we have our show, whatever it may be. However, it's a lot more [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=984.48s)]
*  fair than people think. If you put yourself in the best of shape, if you invest in your gimmick or [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=988.72s)]
*  your character, if you work on your promos, if you are the go-getter who goes in, you know, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=995.36s)]
*  especially in this era of social media, if you go out and you create a little empire, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  you work with the digital teams, again, small bones, if you just take advantage of all that, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1004.56s)]
*  somebody sees it eventually. And that's where things can pick up for you. And I wasn't doing [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1010.8s)]
*  all that. There's certainly parts of it. I can say this was just a bad idea, guys, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1015.68s)]
*  because the original Stardust also had a hat. I only say hat. It's supposed to be a mask, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  but it looked like a hat. And it's like the original Electro from your 90s Spider-Man run. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1024.08s)]
*  Okay. But it also had the, like, basically, I don't know what you call it, it had the look of [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1028.64s)]
*  a condom that had just been yanked on your head. And I went and I showed it to Creative at the time. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1034.8000000000002s)]
*  And I remember as showing it, I was like, I can't wear this. That's okay. And this was the part [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1042.0s)]
*  where my heart broke is I had long hair at the time, or longer. I didn't have a shaved head. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1047.76s)]
*  I never wanted to have a shaved head. And, gosh, they were like, well, no mask, but cut your hair [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1053.12s)]
*  like your brother. And at that point, that heart broke. I remember sitting there in that chair and [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  just like cutting my hair and no idea what I was getting into is Cleveland, which used to be the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1063.12s)]
*  Quicken Loans arena. But that arena, poor thing. I've had some great moments in a sense. But when [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  I walk in there, it's just a dark feeling. Tour announcement. First of all, New York City, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1071.76s)]
*  thank you so much. I love you. Okay, that was absolutely incredible. Okay, we got kicked out [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1078.24s)]
*  of that shitty Brooklyn theater. We stepped it up, went bigger, we went better. And we blasted [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  through four shows in an hour. Unbelievable. Thank you guys so much. You all held me down. I cannot [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1087.92s)]
*  wait to go film a special there. I'm very, very excited. I'm glad that you are all going to be [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1093.6s)]
*  there. Anybody who could not be there that day, we're going to have more shows, eventually in New [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1097.68s)]
*  York City. We're going to have more shows. We got a lot going to focus on these right now. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1103.6s)]
*  The rest of the tour. These are the shows that we have left. We have a second show in Reno, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1106.72s)]
*  San Jose. Both shows are sold out. Portland sold out. And then Honolulu, Hawaii, the Blidesdale [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1110.72s)]
*  arena. That's the final show of the tour. It's kind of crazy. It's really almost wrapped up. I [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1116.16s)]
*  can't believe it. But thank you guys so much. TheAndrewScholes.com. If you want to get any of [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1121.5200000000002s)]
*  the tickets to those remaining shows. I appreciate you all so much. See you soon. Peace. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1126.24s)]
*  Also guys, quick show announcement. November 1 and 2, Lexington, Kentucky. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1131.2s)]
*  That might be the home of the Klan or maybe that's Louisville. Either way, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1135.68s)]
*  I would love for you guys to all show up. Let's talk things out. Let's see what our differences [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  are. Maybe we can make amends. November 22 and 23, Rochester, New York. December 4. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  Announcing this right now. I'm coming to Long Island. I've never headlined in Long Island. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1146.8s)]
*  I am mostly scared of you guys. But now that we interviewed Donald Trump, I feel like you're [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1151.04s)]
*  going to love me. I'm one of the good ones. So I will be at Governor's in Levittown. Come through [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1155.68s)]
*  all those dates and more at AkashSingh.com. Also, we're still doing our thing on fan bases, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  dropping content there. So check that out as well. Now let's get back to the show. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1165.2s)]
*  Did your brother like doing the Gold Dust character? It really depends on the day you ask him. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1169.04s)]
*  I know he's extremely proud of it. Extremely. Especially during the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1174.64s)]
*  androgynous run of the late 90s and him and Rowdy Piper going into WrestleMania 12. He got that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  He read WrestleMania 12. So here was a moment that I, again, I'm in middle school at the time [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1186.64s)]
*  that Gold Dust comes out. Okay. So there's a lot of kids. Yeah, we're about the same age. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1191.28s)]
*  Attitude era is extremely popular. So now all these kids who didn't watch wrestling with [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1195.04s)]
*  elementary school want to ask questions. Well, you know, that's it. I don't have a lot of answers on [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  Gold Dust. And at the time, him and my dad. A lot of words you can't say now. Right. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1204.48s)]
*  Him and my dad weren't speaking. And one of the cooler moments where I realized no matter how [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1209.76s)]
*  bombastic and ridiculous and out there the Gold Dust character was, I watched that Rowdy Piper [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1214.56s)]
*  match at WrestleMania 12 and how much it was a thread throughout the show. It was one of the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1220.0s)]
*  bigger stories of WrestleMania 12. And my dad, who hasn't talked to Dustin at that point, three or [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1224.08s)]
*  four years, I could see him just smiling ear to ear. And he was so, he was so happy that he got [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1228.48s)]
*  that moment. And he had went out and did it on his own. He wasn't Dustin Rhodes. He was Gold Dust. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1235.92s)]
*  And I, it's a very unique character. It's so funny that I went to a comedy show in LA a few years ago [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1241.36s)]
*  and they were talking about if Gold Dust came out today, how he wouldn't be a bad guy at all. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1249.2s)]
*  For example, the guy's doing this Gold Dust, but he's like, I'm Gold Dust and I'm going to kiss this [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1259.28s)]
*  man. And they had a plant in the crowd stand up and go, that's totally cool, man. No, no, but it's [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1263.68s)]
*  going to get me heat. And he's like, no, man. They like threw a rainbow across his street. It was [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1270.32s)]
*  really special and fun. And like, yeah, Gold Dust was just a unique character. But I think if you [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1275.2s)]
*  ask him, it kind of depends. Here's this country boy from Austin, Texas. And then this is the thing [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1280.0800000000002s)]
*  he wanted to do, but he really put like dove into it, dove into it. He's a cinema buff [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1286.48s)]
*  because of Gold Dust, because they'd always want him to quote these lines. So it's something that [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1292.24s)]
*  we're two kids in our family who didn't, we didn't go to college. Our education is this, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1298.48s)]
*  you know, our worldly experience. And I think Dustin got a lot of a good experience out of it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1303.6s)]
*  I think the rumor was that Vince was upset at your dad or something. So gave him this rough [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1308.0s)]
*  character. That's always the story of, so there's no truth to it. The families didn't like each other. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1313.44s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's a good story. It's helped me, you know, but I don't, maybe there's some truth [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1320.8s)]
*  here and there, but I never experienced it so much. I was too young too. I think maybe Vince [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1331.0400000000002s)]
*  and my dad had some back and forth just because my dad went on and did his own thing. He wanted to [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1337.2s)]
*  go back to Florida. He wanted to run Jim Crocker promotions, which was the rival promotion. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1342.48s)]
*  Also, yeah, I don't know if there was a rivalry that existed. It really didn't come down to me, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  unless of course the moment they say, hey, you're Stardust, unless that was it. And I just didn't [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1352.24s)]
*  read between the lines. I'm very naive, so it's possible. Okay. So you're tired of being Stardust. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1358.0s)]
*  You're like, I got to get the hell out of here. You asked for your release. What's going on [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1363.52s)]
*  emotionally right there? Are you going, my career's over. Do you believe there's a path [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1369.6s)]
*  to redemption on the independent circuit? What's happening? I apologize to any wrestler today in [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1374.88s)]
*  any company who thinks they're going to get a release because I ruined it for a lot of them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1381.04s)]
*  And here's why. I told them in a very like, hey, I'll see you next week. I said, no, you won't. I [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1389.92s)]
*  remember telling the talent relations guy, I said, no, you won't. And of course everyone [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1397.04s)]
*  has their emotional dramatic filled weeks and maybe they just thought it was that. But I actually [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1400.1599999999999s)]
*  put my statement out on social media that, hey, thank you so much. Done. And once it was out in [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1405.44s)]
*  the ether, there was nothing. It was a huge gamble because I could have been sued. To this day, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1412.64s)]
*  I don't think I've ever signed the contract. What's it called when you get the- Basically- [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  No non-compete clause. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1426.0s)]
*  I never signed anything after that and it was sent to my house. I could have been sued, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1427.04s)]
*  probably should have been sued, but I needed to take a very big risk and a very big gamble [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1431.1999999999998s)]
*  in that moment. I felt I'd earned it. I thought, hey, the respect they have for my family, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1435.9199999999998s)]
*  all that I've done, never slipped up here once, done everything you asked, give me this one. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1440.7199999999998s)]
*  Let me ride off and okay, we're not going to chase him. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
*  Your dad wanted you to leave, right? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1449.84s)]
*  Oh, well, he just got tired of hearing me complain. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1451.36s)]
*  Right. You're unhappy. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1454.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think as a dad, it just became, well, then quit. Then quit. And [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1455.6s)]
*  you know, I don't know how much he meant it, but I know if he, I always tell people this, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1460.64s)]
*  if he was like, wake up today and come back in this room, he would be, I'd have so much [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1467.68s)]
*  to explain to him about what happened. Everything that happened. And yeah, like, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1474.0800000000002s)]
*  I think if I started it with, well, I've main evented WrestleMania twice. I think he'd, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1482.8s)]
*  all right. All right. What else happened? Like, don't worry about it. You know? But yeah, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1488.24s)]
*  no, it was, I needed to, I tell people all the time, it wasn't just a burn the bridges. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1492.16s)]
*  It was a full burn the boats. I need the idea that I may never come back. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1495.6000000000001s)]
*  You accepted, you might never go back. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of money to walk away from. That's a part that I don't know if people [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1501.28s)]
*  always realize. Like you had a guaranteed life. You could be Stardust forever. You could even [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1504.72s)]
*  potentially go back to Cody Rhodes and the way that it was and make great money for the rest [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1509.44s)]
*  of your life and go off in the sunset. Oh, I didn't know that the, I thought the financial [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1514.0s)]
*  conversation was based on like how often your character was used. No, no. So at the point, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1517.76s)]
*  you know, the attitude brought out guaranteed contracts. So guaranteed contracts, it was not [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1521.6s)]
*  only that, an Epo baby contract, good money, we're out of respect for the family and what they've [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1526.8s)]
*  done. Good money. But I didn't care about like the respect for my family. I love that. I cared about [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1531.44s)]
*  the respect for me. Like I never went anywhere. I've been here this whole time, guys. Like I've [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1536.88s)]
*  been part of WrestleMania angles, intercontinental title. Like why you get me so close to the top of [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1541.76s)]
*  the ladder and not going to take it. And again, I put a lot of that blame on myself looking back [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1546.32s)]
*  at it in hindsight. But at the moment, it was, you mentioned the emotional state. I was, I don't know [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1552.48s)]
*  how I could possibly describe that emotional state other than I was scared to death, but couldn't let [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1559.6000000000001s)]
*  my wife know I was scared to death. And financially, this is the thing that no one knows. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1566.16s)]
*  I wasn't the best with my money. So I tell people all the time, like, oh, I'm fine. I worked there [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1572.88s)]
*  for 10 years. I'm good. I got a good net. Wasn't the case. How bad? So, well, basically I'd still [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1577.28s)]
*  be working. If I started working immediately after the WWE deal ended, I would be check to check [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1585.0400000000002s)]
*  in terms of check to check. I just bought our first house and didn't outside of Dallas. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1592.48s)]
*  And it wasn't as I always tell people I'm the one Rhodes is good with his money. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1598.24s)]
*  No, not necessary. Yes. And it's gotten better. It's gotten better. But that was a very scary [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1603.36s)]
*  moment because I had a wife, you know, and like, that's the number one thing is I can [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1612.9599999999998s)]
*  not spend it. Like she worked for WWE too. Yeah. She was a ring announcer. And she of course, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1617.36s)]
*  because she's super loyal. You know, the number one thing you want. She's I didn't think she was [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  going to leave. And then a week later, she's like, Oh, yeah, I'm out too. No, don't. Yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1631.04s)]
*  One of us needs a job. I needed her far more than, than she realized in that point. You know, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1638.32s)]
*  everyone there have been some imbalance in terms of one time, I think she was leading pulling the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1645.04s)]
*  wagon and other times I was able but I had the best partner in the world. I mean, ballsy and [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1651.6000000000001s)]
*  bold for her to leave. She left and she needed to because she was getting really when I was gone, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1656.8s)]
*  she was saying some wild stuff. She was yelling at people. Yeah. She was just very much a wonderful [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1661.8400000000001s)]
*  wife. Ready to fight at all times. So like, you know, she's from Detroit, Michigan. She's yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1667.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so you go into the independent circuit. Yeah. Okay. But you do this thing where you post, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1673.44s)]
*  I think what is on Twitter, the list, the list, the list. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. So the list is [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1678.72s)]
*  fine. Explain like the thinking behind this. Are you creating your own storyline? Are you using the [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1684.3999999999999s)]
*  heat of leaving and trying to propel yourself in the independent circuit? Is it purely financial? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1689.2s)]
*  Or is there like a long game for this as well? The list was I'd found when people got fired a lot. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1694.8799999999999s)]
*  I hate saying it so strongly, but when people got let go that they would say something like, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1702.8s)]
*  hey, that's great. Thank you. Stay tuned for the next chapter. I always stay tuned for the next [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1707.36s)]
*  chapter to me is the kiss of death. That to me almost reads as you don't have the next chapter. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1711.68s)]
*  So I wanted to have a next chapter. Stay tuned to the next chapter. You haven't planned anything. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1717.68s)]
*  Right. This means, hey, this is my plan. This is under control of my fucking destiny. And these are [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1722.0s)]
*  the names I want. And I wanted to mobilize. So at the time social media is really, really [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1727.36s)]
*  as strong. I mean, it's you could build a brand on there alone. So I wanted to mobilize those fans [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1732.4799999999998s)]
*  who did rally behind, I can't believe this is happening. Like this is, this was one of your guys [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1737.76s)]
*  and he's out there. So I wanted to mobilize. And I went to Kevin Owens, who I work with at WWE. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1742.4799999999998s)]
*  And Kevin Owens was the one who kind of proofread the list in a sense of that one's not going to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1748.7199999999998s)]
*  do anything. Do you really want that one? Yeah, I think I do want that one. And these were the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1755.68s)]
*  biggest names on the independent circuit. I guess it wasn't so much the biggest names, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1758.48s)]
*  some of the biggest names, but it was more a real diversity to the list. And what I mean by diversity [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1762.64s)]
*  to the list is I trained through WWE as a WWE type wrestler, old school TV style, a different style [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1766.96s)]
*  of wrestling. And at the time, the underground scene, it's almost better to label it underground [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1774.72s)]
*  than independent was the coolest stuff you could imagine. Ring of honor. Ring of honor, every [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1778.88s)]
*  independent. I mean, like you big, crazy high spots, athleticism out the roof, a bunch of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1784.0s)]
*  psychologically nonsensical stuff from my training. But I wanted people to know, like, I'm not above [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1790.24s)]
*  that. Like, F it. I'm going to come and I'm going to try what I would consider some stupid stuff. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1796.32s)]
*  And I don't want to wrestle anybody. I don't want to do a WWE versus WWE guy. No, like put me against [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1802.56s)]
*  the youngest, dumbest guy who does really fun stuff. Like put me against that person. I want [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1808.48s)]
*  to see and test myself. And that was- So everybody on the list is just an idiot? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1814.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. They're all smart in their own ways. You know, like- [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1817.8400000000001s)]
*  That's a code for an idiot. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1823.0400000000002s)]
*  White meat baby face coming out of my mouth. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1827.6000000000001s)]
*  All right, so you're beating up these retards. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1830.8000000000002s)]
*  There's only one guy I never got. There's one name I didn't check off the list. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1834.96s)]
*  Wait, who? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1838.64s)]
*  It was a guy named Roderick Strong, not an idiot. We just never crossed past. Like I thought, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1839.2s)]
*  we got to get this one on the list. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1847.6s)]
*  WrestleDaisy at 41. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1848.64s)]
*  Yeah, man, we got to get it off the list. But yeah, that was a really fun time. Every one of [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1849.84s)]
*  those people offered something huge to what I was doing. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1854.8s)]
*  Okay, are they aware of the list? Are they hitting you up on the side? Like, hey, this is a [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1857.68s)]
*  brilliant idea. Let's make this happen. Okay. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1860.96s)]
*  Well, most of the people on the list were really, I mean, not to like- Most people on the list were [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1863.6s)]
*  yes, we'll make this. There's like five different indies I work for who want to book this. Where do [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1868.0s)]
*  you want to do it? And I'll do promos. I'll do that. Most people were really excited. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1873.28s)]
*  So you guys are both cutting your own promos. You're starting up these stories, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1877.28s)]
*  and then they're happening on the indie circuit. Do you immediately notice crowds [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1880.4s)]
*  being a lot bigger than they would normally be at some of these indies? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1885.2s)]
*  When does it feel like there's a little undercurrent? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1888.96s)]
*  Well, the second weekend I did independent wrestling, I did it for a company called [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1892.0800000000002s)]
*  Northeast Wrestling that's Connecticut based, and they were more of a mom and pop indie. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1895.76s)]
*  And they did a softball fields for their big summer shows. And I noticed, I did three in a [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1900.8s)]
*  row. I noticed we were at like 1,500, 2,000, 4,500. These aren't indie crowds. Indie crowd is 50 to [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1908.16s)]
*  200. And a smart indie is going to book a building that only holds. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1916.64s)]
*  So it looks nice. Yeah. And it's loud and they're excited. And that's your core group. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1920.64s)]
*  But I noticed there we were having numbers. Two things are happening at the same time. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1924.72s)]
*  I've helped mobilize me and get people, hey, please come check me out. If you've never seen [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1930.8s)]
*  an independent before, we'll do some cool stuff. You might find some people you like. But also at [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1935.52s)]
*  the time, independents were on the rise. So because of guys like Matt and Nick Jackson, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1939.44s)]
*  or two people, I use an example, but that happening, that happening was the perfect storm. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1944.08s)]
*  Because some TVs at the time for WWE were doing 4,500. It's not easy. I mean, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1949.84s)]
*  it's not easy to sell tickets on a regular basis. So the fact that that was happening [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1957.6799999999998s)]
*  really opened my eyes. I was in Manchester in the United Kingdom and there was a show [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1962.9599999999998s)]
*  at a kid's ice arena. But it held about, I think, 6,000 people. And I never will know the full [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1967.28s)]
*  number. And I could give you the wrestler exaggeration of like, we had seven there. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1974.72s)]
*  It's a great part of the Vince Dock where he goes, we had 93,000 people in Detroit. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1978.48s)]
*  We had 93,000. And some guy goes, there was 70,000 people. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1982.24s)]
*  It was Silver Blades Arena. And I remember thinking, this is like a mini, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1989.04s)]
*  this is actually what I thought. I have seen a mini WWE show. There's signs for the locker rooms, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1992.8s)]
*  there's catering, every seat is full. And that was a big one for me where I thought there's a [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=1997.44s)]
*  thing happening. I wonder who else is in on this thing. Who else knows who else can drive this? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2002.56s)]
*  What is the next steps? And I didn't know though. Did you feel like you were spearheading it? Or do [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2008.8799999999999s)]
*  you feel like there was other? I felt like there were two huge fronts to it. And I think I was at [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2013.44s)]
*  the lead of one of those fronts. I think the other front was a group called New Japan Pro Wrestling. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2025.6799999999998s)]
*  And New Japan was doing mind-blowing athleticism and storytelling. They had Kenny Omega and they [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2030.8s)]
*  had the Young Bucks. And I don't think we have anything in common amongst the four of us other [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2037.52s)]
*  than we wanted it. We wanted it. We would fight for each other. We would pair together. I went [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2043.2s)]
*  over there and saw exactly the Bullet Club was happening. What's the Bullet Club? So the Bullet [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2050.08s)]
*  Club was this faction, great factions in wrestling. DX, the Four Horsemen, whatever. It was a [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2054.56s)]
*  faction in New Japan, but they had the sickest merchandise. It was this skull. And it got so big [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2060.0s)]
*  that actually this rep from, I think he was Hot Topic or somewhere, came to a WrestleMania. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2066.96s)]
*  And he asked somebody, he said, where are the Bullet Club guys? And they were like, oh, that's [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2071.36s)]
*  an independent thing. And again, I was so lucky to, their wave was going and my wave was going. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2076.0s)]
*  And that's where we collided. And from there it was different. There it is, the Bullet Club. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2083.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. I was the leader for a short period of time. There's a whole online argument [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2088.24s)]
*  about was I ever a Bullet Club leader? It is official. I did lead it. You heard it here. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2093.12s)]
*  I did lead it. I won against Kenny to get leadership of the Bullet Club for a brief time. But [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2097.92s)]
*  a guy in WWE, I have to shout him out for that logo, is Finn Balor. He's probably owed millions [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2102.8s)]
*  of dollars for the success of Bullet Club. He started it. And I don't think he's ever seen any [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2108.0s)]
*  of that. I know he's just happy that he was the one. Well, as a former leader, you should cut him [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2112.96s)]
*  a treat. Hey, man. I just put him over on the lap. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2116.7999999999997s)]
*  You, Kenny the Young Bucks, you start talking about this event. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2124.7999999999997s)]
*  Can you tell us how All In ends up happening? All In is the craziest. The original All In was [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2130.0s)]
*  an independent show. Oh, no, no, no, no. Go back even for the Meltzer tweet. Yeah, he said we [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2136.64s)]
*  couldn't do it. So there's a guy, he's a wrestling journalist. He is. Meltzer. It was his birthday [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2142.08s)]
*  yesterday. Well, let's let's because he I think plays a really important part as in all wrestling [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2146.0s)]
*  stories. There are all these side factions that influence the he's the biggest observer is what [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2151.76s)]
*  his newsletters called, but he's been covering wrestling and mixed martial arts for 40 years. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2158.48s)]
*  And it went from being a newsletter that fans got the inside scoops, but also a lot of the financial [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2164.48s)]
*  aspects of this that he just always covered it and like, whoa, I feel almost forever this tether [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2170.64s)]
*  to him. We're not I wouldn't say we're close or anything like that. But I always feel this tether [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2176.64s)]
*  because he made that tweet. And here I am. He tweets that they asked, could ROH get 10,000 people [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  in arena? Ring of Honor. This is at the time I've been on these shows. Yeah, I know we can't. I'm [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2187.3599999999997s)]
*  buddy. I've seen it like have you done the show with the Young Bucks and Kenny with Ring of Honor [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2194.16s)]
*  yet? So we have we've done together with Ring of Honor in New Japan. We did a show at Lakefront [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2199.36s)]
*  that was for Ring of Honor specifically that did as many seats in the building was 7,000 people. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2203.84s)]
*  So what are we talking about here? If you're feeling the bus? Yeah, not only feeling the bus. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2209.04s)]
*  I'm pre workout up at the gym. I'm loaded. Niacin is like pumping through my veins. It's a lifetime [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2213.04s)]
*  fitness in Woodstock, Georgia. And I saw this tweet and I thought like, no, man, like this is [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2223.2000000000003s)]
*  again, let's just will it into existence. So he goes, I don't think anyone in America outside [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2228.64s)]
*  the WWE can do 10,000 seats. You tweet. I'll take that bet Dave. I said I'll take that bet. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2233.3599999999997s)]
*  And then what is the what is the like underground feeling or does it cross over from underground to [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2240.3199999999997s)]
*  just WWE fans? Like what's happening? Well, immediately upon tweeting it, I had to call [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  everyone. And hey, are we interested in this? I am very, very worried. And I would, I would not [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2249.92s)]
*  worry that we couldn't. But at this point, I'm wrestling for one company, pretty exclusive [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2259.6s)]
*  domestically in the United States that being Ring of Honor. And Matt and Nick were all making the [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2264.4s)]
*  same rounds. Kenny's in Japan the whole time. We need financing. Can we go to Ring of Honor for [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2269.84s)]
*  some assistance with financing? And he just passed away. A wonderful man named Joe Koff was [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2276.72s)]
*  he's far more instrumental in it than people ever know, because he saw what we were doing and thought, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2282.08s)]
*  okay, it's definitely not in your contract, but we can help with production. We can, we can help you. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2287.3599999999997s)]
*  Here's the number to call. Here's Gary Juster was his name. Because again, I'm now calling buildings. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2294.24s)]
*  Hey, Ontario, California, you know, that building out there is a US bank arena or something like [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2299.4399999999996s)]
*  calling these buildings like, hey, we want to run a show. Like I have no cold calling. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2304.56s)]
*  I am cold calling. Yeah. And so we get what we need in place to be able to do it. We're also told, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2308.48s)]
*  I think it was Labor Day or Memorial Day weekend. And they give us the September, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2316.96s)]
*  which one September Labor Day? Labor Day. Yeah, they told me that's the worst date for wrestling. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2320.48s)]
*  It's it's never like everything. People have plans. They're partying at the beach. Why would they go to [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2324.64s)]
*  the wrestling? That's why it's available. And I thought, okay, it's cheap. It's available. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2328.72s)]
*  Here we are. We're going to scale. This is one of my favorite things in my brief management run was [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2333.6s)]
*  to be able to scale tickets. So, okay, front row, $150. You know, that's like this bowl, like $25. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2337.76s)]
*  I thought it was so cool. I get no clue what I'm doing. But and Matt, and Matt, Nick, Brandi, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2346.32s)]
*  Dana, Kenny, we're all kind of in on this together. We're paying people the most, you know, PayPal, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2354.08s)]
*  DEMO, cash. But the big rule we wanted to break was there was rules even for all the companies [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2360.72s)]
*  that you can't cross the streams. Like this is before the term forbidden door was coined. But [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2366.56s)]
*  can such and such from CMLL in Mexico be in the same ring with a guy from AAA in Mexico? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2371.3599999999997s)]
*  And we were of the thought, there are no rules to the show. We're running the show. Me and these two [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2377.2s)]
*  other guys are running this. So if you want to be on it, it's going to be huge. And how we knew it [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2381.04s)]
*  was going to be huge is we put the tickets on sale. It crashed. We're on the drive from this press [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2385.12s)]
*  conference where the mic didn't even work. We're already as Bush League as we could be and it [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2390.48s)]
*  crashes and it sold out in I think it sold out in 23 minutes 11,236. United Center, Chicago. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2395.2799999999997s)]
*  Not United. It was United holds like 20,000. This was a now arena in Schaumburg. Oh, this is [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2402.08s)]
*  the suburb of Chicago. But also there's like a plaque on the outside of it to this day with me [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2409.6s)]
*  and Matt, Matt, Nick's faces that I've never seen in person just because they were doing graduations [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2415.68s)]
*  might some minor league games here and there. They hadn't had something fill it up like that [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2422.8s)]
*  either in a long time. And yeah, 23 minutes or 11,236 people and everything at that point, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2426.16s)]
*  everything, everything in my life changed. Do you tweet anything at that moment? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2431.92s)]
*  I think I tweeted a lot of stuff. A lot of free workout. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2435.68s)]
*  Always my best ideas under pre-workout. I actually tell Triple H whenever I send him a creative idea, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2441.68s)]
*  I always will say this is I'm caffeinated up because I'll look at it 10 hours later and be [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2447.52s)]
*  like, why was this important? The post pump clarity. Yeah, is that unreal? And that's where [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2452.72s)]
*  the tweets should go out. But at that point it was the first thing that happened with All In isn't [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2458.24s)]
*  just the show itself. The best way I can describe it, it was like Woodstock for wrestling. Because [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2464.72s)]
*  this guy who does a series of podcasts, he's super successful. He's helped rehabilitate a lot of the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2468.9599999999996s)]
*  older wrestlers. His name is Conrad Thompson. Conrad told us, he's like, hey, can I run a convention? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2473.6s)]
*  People are going to piggyback off this destination event you guys have created. This is unheard of. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2478.9599999999996s)]
*  Can I do a convention at the Hyatt and I'll take care of it. You give me the rules, you know, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2484.16s)]
*  because we were really big on it's not going to be a legends deal. This is young, this is up and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2489.2s)]
*  coming. You're going to see the next generation of superstar and wrestler. And once he set that [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2494.16s)]
*  three day convention, every vendor applied, every booth was filled. I remember walking into that [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2500.8799999999997s)]
*  hotel and there's just an entire lobby full of wrestling fans all in that Bullet Club shirt. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2506.48s)]
*  And they've got a live radio set up in the lobby. And when we walked in, everyone just stood up and [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2511.7599999999998s)]
*  clapped. Wow. And I felt like royalty. Then I went by the bar menu and the bar menu is labeled with [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2516.3199999999997s)]
*  Faro's fries, American nightmare cheeseburger. I was like, yes, this is happening. We made it. Oh, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2524.08s)]
*  man. Did anything go wrong? Everything went wrong. Like minutes leading up to the event where you're [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2530.32s)]
*  like, oh, we got to cancel it. So I almost, I wouldn't be sitting in this chair had this [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2536.32s)]
*  gone the other way. And this is not a fun story to tell or anything like that, but it's the truth [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2542.56s)]
*  because some people know the story. I got into a slight tussle the night before because I'm [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2546.1600000000003s)]
*  walking Faro, my beloved husky, who's always a part of what I do. And I had him off a leash. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2552.4s)]
*  I was in the wrong. But Faro is chill. Faro's not ever going to be a problem, but this man got in [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2559.04s)]
*  my face over it. So you shouldn't, that's dangerous. Probably right. He's probably had a bad experience [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2565.12s)]
*  with a dog. I'm not even, you're probably right, but something about it. Maybe I had some caffeine [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2569.6s)]
*  in my system. I don't know what it was, but he like got so close that I felt like he had encroached [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2573.36s)]
*  on my space. So I did shove him. And when I shoved him, he rolled back into the bushes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2577.92s)]
*  Like he took this enormous Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin style fall. And the next thing I knew was [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2582.64s)]
*  like, oh no, he's a wrestler. And he had called the cops. I decided, hey, I'm going to stay in the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2588.88s)]
*  lobby. I'm not going to try and run. I'll stay in the lobby. So it really had, he said like, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2599.28s)]
*  charges. It's over. It's over. It's over. And that was the first, the next day was the first [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2603.44s)]
*  day in my career. I had a security detail and my wife was, you do not leave this room without this. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2608.96s)]
*  His name was Sam. He's like, Sam is going everywhere with you. Like I had, like I was a problem child [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2615.12s)]
*  all along or something. This one incident happened over our dog. You got to put a leash. Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2618.96s)]
*  They put me on a leash, but I got to the building. Yeah. Cause it was, it was touch and go for a [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2624.96s)]
*  second. In addition to that, we lost one of our producers. There's a little pyro, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2630.0s)]
*  high jinx that went off at the beginning where we were trying to show people that we were the [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2636.24s)]
*  first company to have pyro again and it didn't explode. But then it did as I was starting to go [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2639.04s)]
*  into the next bitch. It was like the fucking joker. Randomly. I got an email again. I've [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2644.16s)]
*  almost been arrested now, so I can't go to sleep. I got an email in the middle of the night from [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2651.28s)]
*  John Mayer's publicist. And I thought, no, it's going to be not real. Like, say, hey, John would [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2655.2s)]
*  like to come with his friends who are doing a bachelor party, but there are no seats. I guess [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2661.12s)]
*  a true, true sellout. I'm like, yeah, whatever. Like I'm not replying to this again. I'm already [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2664.88s)]
*  in the doghouse the next morning. I wake up and Dana Massey was her name. She tells me like, hey, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2670.16s)]
*  did you get back to that email? Like, no. Well, I did. We, John Mayer is coming to the show. I'm [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2674.64s)]
*  like, wait, John Mayer, like the actual John Mayer, like he's coming. And we legit didn't [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2681.04s)]
*  have a seat. So we put him in the middle of the aisle. So he's just in the middle. So [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2685.44s)]
*  the whole show, you can see him. Like every match. There he is, man. John, that's so cool. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2692.08s)]
*  It was really like touching that he wanted to come. I just didn't believe it. But yeah, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2698.16s)]
*  it's just a series of little calamities. But when we got there, everyone was so excited to be on it. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2701.84s)]
*  How was the wrestling that night? The main event got super rushed because one match went over, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2708.0s)]
*  but even super rushed, it was fireworks. Ray Mysterio was part of it. Just him giving us the [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2714.4s)]
*  rub. It's like, here's a former world champion and WWE Hall of Famer. Ray Mysterio wants to be part [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2719.44s)]
*  of All In. And again, I'll never forget Ray is heading to the ring, taking pictures with other [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2725.36s)]
*  wrestlers who are backstage shocked that they're in the same locker room as Ray when the show has [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2730.88s)]
*  eight minutes left on the air. I'm like, buddy, in his little Wolverine outfit, I'm like, please go [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2735.28s)]
*  to the ring. But I think the most fun I had was after my stuff was over, I got to sit down in the [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2739.44s)]
*  producer chair and just put the headset on and call a few shots here and there. I said, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2746.6400000000003s)]
*  check this out, this is coming. And it just felt like the job I always wanted, the moment I always [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2752.0s)]
*  wanted. But I'm real greedy. I am. I'm super, white meat. I'm super greedy that the moment it [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2756.96s)]
*  was happening, I just was thinking, what else are we going to do? I bet we can do this again. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2763.84s)]
*  I bet we can go double or nothing. I bet we can do this again. And yeah. When do you get the call [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2768.08s)]
*  from Tony Khan? He was at the original All In. Okay. Yeah. I needed some help. So I needed help [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2773.28s)]
*  flying Chris Jericho. Matt Nickme needed help flying Chris Jericho there. And Tony offered to [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2780.08s)]
*  use his plane. And Tony's a big wrestling fan. Yeah. Okay. But he also comes from some money. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2785.6000000000004s)]
*  I think his family's involved with the Jaguars and stuff. Yeah, they own the Jags. They own the [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2791.76s)]
*  Jags. Okay. Yeah. So he, you and him connect. He sees what the four of you guys are doing. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2794.8s)]
*  AEW sprouts out of that. Yeah. Do you have to pitch him? Is he pitching you guys? No, I think, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2801.5200000000004s)]
*  and I think that's one of the more why maybe I don't, I wouldn't say, I hope there's no tension [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2806.4s)]
*  between all of the four on the ground, but everyone's got a different story a little bit. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2812.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. And everyone's story puts them in the in the driver's seat for sure. And I think he already [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2817.92s)]
*  had in his mind, because he had scribbled down the name dynamite for TV, I think he'd already [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2824.64s)]
*  had in his mind what he wanted. Yeah. I think what we offered was proof of concept. Yeah. And that, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2829.44s)]
*  hey, we can show this to somebody. Because I remember sitting in the up fronts for, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  at the time WarnerMedia before Discovery. Upfronts are a like an advertising showcase. So you. Yes. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2841.76s)]
*  Just for anybody's watching right now. Yes. So basically, you talk to all the people that [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2847.2s)]
*  would potentially advertise on your programs. Right. And you pitch them what it's going to be. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2851.2s)]
*  Yeah. And it was at Madison Square Garden. Yeah. It was a blue carpet, all this. And I remember, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2854.48s)]
*  so I'm sitting there and this guy is going on and on about the show we're doing, but he's never seen [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2858.56s)]
*  it. And they're using photos from all in and photos from like our independent run. They're [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2865.3599999999997s)]
*  just plastered up there. And there's like Daniel Radcliffe sitting in front of me. Shaq is in the [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2869.9199999999996s)]
*  corner. I'm like, please take my picture down. This guy spent a lot of time on us. Like, I hope [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2874.32s)]
*  we do well, but that's where it all started. And everybody had a different, again, Madnik can claim [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2878.96s)]
*  to be in the driver's seat. I have a claim to it. Tony for sure has a claim to it. Kenny, everybody. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2883.28s)]
*  I think that's why it worked. Yeah. I think that's why it worked. I look forward to everyone's books [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2888.1600000000003s)]
*  being out where it's like, ah, it was me. I did it. There's a great book called The Dirt. Which is [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2891.84s)]
*  like Motley Crue's story. Yeah. And it's told in four different ways. Oh, I love that. So each [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2896.56s)]
*  member of the band has their rendition of the story. Yeah. And how different these four [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2902.56s)]
*  fucking stories. Oh, yes, that's the best. Like there's one story where a guy's like, yeah, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2907.92s)]
*  I fell in love with this girl. And then the next guy is telling the story. He's like, this guy was [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2911.6s)]
*  fucking my girl. And they all truly believe that's what's happened. That's why I never, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2915.2s)]
*  I never try to go in absolutes on anything because I know everyone truly believes their part in this. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2924.72s)]

*  the independent scene, I got to give a little WWE guy TV, but I got the, like the underground rub. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2976.56s)]
*  I got, especially, hey, I'm going to try this stupid stuff. Some of it, I'm going to go for it. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=2983.2s)]

*  so great and like you could feel them kind of coming up. Were there any that were depressing? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3178.88s)]
*  You go from an arena every single night to then within a week you're in a ballroom at like a [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3183.04s)]
*  Marriott. Okay. So there's, I always say I did, because we did an absurd amount of every weekend [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3188.6400000000003s)]
*  and the schedule was where I'd have to fly every day because it wasn't like a normal loop where I [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3195.36s)]
*  could travel and the logistics weren't coordinated. I got from all pro wrestling and NorCal to one in [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3199.6800000000003s)]
*  Corpus Christi. There's one bad indie I did, but every indie had its unique charm. For example, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3205.92s)]
*  there's no pyro. There's no explosions. There's not a lot of production on independence. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3212.16s)]
*  I remember I did this really good one actually called VIP wrestling and I stood up on the second [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3215.68s)]
*  buckle to do something, flex, stick my arms out, just G up a little and this dude shot like a pop [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3219.68s)]
*  gun of confetti up into me and I thought that's okay. That's where we're at. Thank you. Yeah, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3225.92s)]
*  like, you know, appreciate it, dog. Thank you. How do you honestly react? No, I remember thinking [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3232.8799999999997s)]
*  like a lot of times in my mind and say like, yep, this is where we're at. I knew what it was [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3239.12s)]
*  and as long as the seats were full, I'm not mad, you know, so that's the one you didn't want to be [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3245.52s)]
*  at and I am lucky I did not have one of those where you see these horror stories online [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3250.64s)]
*  and I didn't have the second row was empty. I didn't have it. I was lucky that every place I went, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3254.96s)]
*  we got to fill up or near fill up. The only bad one I ever did, I was doing a guest role on [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3260.08s)]
*  Arrow at the time. Stephen Amell, who I'd worked with briefly at WWE gave me this huge opportunity [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3267.92s)]
*  to come and do Arrow and I lied to the production. Again, money. I again needed to get serious about [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3274.0800000000004s)]
*  this. So the production was like, you got to stay in Vancouver. You can't leave. Well, I know I'm [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3282.88s)]
*  not shooting on this day. I know for sure I've double confirmed. So I'm going to go to this [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3286.7200000000003s)]
*  random independent in Connecticut, which is a hike to get there from Vancouver. From Vancouver [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3291.52s)]
*  Connecticut on the way. And I'm going to do my normal bit, have this big match and I'll stay in [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3295.52s)]
*  the ring. And if you want to come in the ring and take photos, it's always for me, that was the best [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3301.2s)]
*  part of the night, the end of the night. So I go to, I go to Connecticut to this independent. And [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3304.0s)]
*  the night before I'm in Vancouver and it's legit three in the morning and they haven't done, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3308.48s)]
*  they're not done with me yet. And I'm laying in a pool of water and they're, they've got just the [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3313.04s)]
*  gun from the scene pointed at me and they're just trying to frame the shot up. I'm in the middle of [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3317.6s)]
*  like cold winter in Vancouver, laying in this water in full gear and the whole deal. And I told [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3322.32s)]
*  the lady at the production, I was like, have that van ready to take me to the airport. Like just don't [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3328.56s)]
*  say anything about where I'm going. Have it ready to take me to the airport. So go to the airport. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3332.4s)]
*  It's just a stressful day. I'm putting on spray tan in the bathroom at the Sky Club. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3335.92s)]
*  Just having a stressful day. But I wanted to make this show and I get there and we do the [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3342.0800000000004s)]
*  match and it's great. And then I'll remember the promoter had promised me for an after party. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3347.28s)]
*  And that didn't, I didn't, that didn't seem right. I didn't feel like that was part of the deal. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3353.84s)]
*  And I had said like, Hey, I'll sign a bunch of stuff, whatever you need, but like, no. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3357.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he got a little aggressive with me on this was part of the deal that you do this after [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3362.32s)]
*  party. So at this point out of spite, like you got it, I'll be there. So the guy's driving me. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3368.1600000000003s)]
*  I come to the after party. I get carted outside the door, which has been a long time, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3374.3199999999997s)]
*  big marker on my hand. I'm like, Oh, this is great. I sit down. There's nothing to this. I did not [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3378.24s)]
*  need to be here. There's not a fan engagement to it. There's nothing to it. And I guess it was his [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3382.64s)]
*  birthday or something. So when he walks in, everyone clapped for him and had this big moment. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3386.48s)]
*  And I thought this is, this is the one bad one I've had. And a lot of other factors went into it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3392.0s)]
*  It wasn't just his birthday party, but yeah, other than that, I had no bad experiences. I knew what [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3397.44s)]
*  it was. Yeah, I knew where you level set the expectations. Also, my mom, she's, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3401.84s)]
*  she has the best quote of all when I told her I'm gonna go do independent wrestling and I'm [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3406.96s)]
*  gonna make something of it and I'm gonna make it. I remember telling her and she said, great, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3410.88s)]
*  you'll either end up dead or in jail, dead or in jail. And now mama Rhodes is a fixture on [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  WWE television. She gets her front row seats every show. So just does a little wave. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3421.84s)]
*  I always laugh when you tell a story because it's like dead or in jail. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3427.76s)]
*  Mom, it's wrestling. It's selling drugs on the fucking corners in Baltimore. It seemed a bit [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3431.92s)]
*  extreme. Dead or in jail. Also, like, how do you get dead or in jail? Hey, the independent wrestling [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3438.5600000000004s)]
*  didn't work out. So I got murdered. So I started crime. Like, I don't know, dead or in jail. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3443.6000000000004s)]
*  And now she's loving it. How different was the bag like when you left WWE to doing the independent [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3449.76s)]
*  circuit? Like how much? So the biggest thing you've got to do, and I think it's the same [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3454.72s)]
*  to this day, is you can't out price yourself on an independent. So I noticed some guys would come [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3462.7999999999997s)]
*  from WWE and this promoter, remember they might have 200 seats to sell. They're probably all 20, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3466.8799999999997s)]
*  $30 maybe. And they're going to get some from the tables if they have guys like merchandise [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3471.68s)]
*  element to it or whatever, maybe. So I'd see guys price themselves at $4,500 a show. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3476.64s)]
*  I mean, let's just do the math. Like you got 200 people, $20. What was that, four grand? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3482.4s)]
*  Yeah. So this is one guy. So one guy prices himself at $4,500. Over three days, unless you [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3486.88s)]
*  have a sponsor or somebody's there. There's all these little like loopholes you could find. I [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3493.6800000000003s)]
*  didn't want to be that guy because I knew they won't bring me back. But I also can't price myself [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3498.56s)]
*  too low. So we ended up, there were shows I did for, I mean, there were some shows I did for free. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3502.48s)]
*  Wow. There were some shows I would do for like $1,500. And some shows I did for $750. It was all [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3509.84s)]
*  over the map. But the point was they're going to have such a good time. I'm not going to be involved [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3519.36s)]
*  in your storyline here so much. You don't have to worry about that. I'm going to do so much with [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3524.0800000000004s)]
*  them at the end of the night and throughout the meet and greet that you'll keep me coming, keep [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3528.5600000000004s)]
*  me coming. And they never, I always stayed booked. It's one of my things I hate the most about modern [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3532.6400000000003s)]
*  indie wrestling is the inflation. The money is now huge in our game. So guys are saying, oh, I need [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3537.44s)]
*  first class and six grand. Like, buddy, again, there's 200 people there, man. Like take a look [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3544.4s)]
*  at the room. Do you want to do this or do you not? And yeah, I was lucky that it was definitely a far [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3549.84s)]
*  beneath where I was at with WWE in terms of the bag. But if you hustle, and there's a guy on the [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3557.12s)]
*  independency now, Matt Cardona, who had been with WWE for, if you hustle, you will find a lot of [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3564.0s)]
*  money. It's just new to you. Matt Cardona spoke about an interesting concept with you. It's called [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3570.64s)]
*  the Cody lie. Cody lie. Yeah. Yeah. He's famous for the Cody lie. What is the Cody lie? Cody lie is, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3575.92s)]
*  this is your heel turn right here on the Flavor of Fuck. If the story needs a little extra, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3582.96s)]
*  then you just throw it, you got to keep it, the rule of the Cody lie has to be true, but there's [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3587.76s)]
*  just got an added element to it. He talks about his first meeting when he had come to talk to us [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3592.48s)]
*  at AEW and how he blew that meeting and he claims he didn't say the things he did. He said two of the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3597.44s)]
*  three things I said he did. The third is just an added for the color, for give it a little something. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3603.04s)]
*  Yeah. But these lies are outside of entertainment. These lies are just in life, right? What's the [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3608.2400000000002s)]
*  difference? I would say it's never a lie. It's just you got to put a little something on it. Yeah, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3615.12s)]
*  exactly. If you've ever seen the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, it's a classic, once the [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3621.44s)]
*  legend becomes fact, print the legend. Come on, I grew up under the tree of the storyteller man. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3626.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm reading a book to Liberty and that's not as great. Mother Gothel may not be the heel [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3637.52s)]
*  in this story. I would be if she had her own problem. You got to use lies to tell the truth. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3643.04s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. Exactly. Cody lie has been exaggerated in the business now to the [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3647.2000000000003s)]
*  point where I have to be very firm about, hey, the dead serious. Please understand this is not a bit. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3651.04s)]
*  This happened. And I hate that. What is the action figure lie that you told him? Listen, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3657.7599999999998s)]
*  he claimed Hasbro WWF action figures, which are famous. There's a rumor that there's a [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3667.68s)]
*  yellow boots variant Dusty Rhodes. And the reality is there isn't. There's a sun damaged Dusty Rhodes [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3673.2799999999997s)]
*  where the boots have become yellow. And that's what people are talking about the yellow boots. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3682.0s)]
*  But I told him and I would be the expert on this being that's my father that I did have one. And [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3686.3199999999997s)]
*  that I had spoken to someone high up at Hasbro and they wanted it. But I wanted him to get the first [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3692.0s)]
*  look at it. Matt Cardona. And he asked, well, where is it? I said, I'll bring it to TV. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3698.32s)]
*  And I had it in my bag. I had nothing in my bag. This is I'm seeing how long I can go. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3703.1200000000003s)]
*  This is not a Cody lie. This is a lie. Just a regular lie. Well, here's where the truth might be. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3708.96s)]
*  There might be. So I told him, I said, just go go. It's in my bag. Just go get it. But the whole [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3714.1600000000003s)]
*  point of this was I wanted him to get caught going through my bags so that I could tell the [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3724.56s)]
*  locker room here this guy's going through our bags. We need to kick him out of the locker room. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3730.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what the look in his bag. And then he tells everybody. He's got some kind of steal shit. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3735.44s)]
*  You don't go into someone's bag. That's an instant see a lie. Why is he in your bag? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  So I went right in on him. Like, you can't trust this guy. He's going into people's bags. And he [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3743.84s)]
*  was how he didn't know. Why would I put it in my bag? Like, if it's this valuable piece, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3748.4s)]
*  is it just loose in my bag? But yeah, I told everybody it went through my bag. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3754.56s)]
*  And that's the problem in the locker room. You know, we got over it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3757.52s)]
*  Okay. A.W. You're the VP. You have everything. Once again, life is great. You're making money. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3762.2400000000002s)]
*  You took all the risk. No reason to leave. You're killing it. Everything's going great. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3769.1200000000003s)]
*  Why on earth would you shake the cage again? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3774.96s)]
*  I don't want to give you a Cody lie. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3780.32s)]
*  There's so many factors that went into it. But this is one small example, because when I start [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3783.52s)]
*  talking about this, people try to cite, oh, it was this. Oh, it was this. It was this. Here's what I [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3790.4s)]
*  can tell you. It wasn't. It wasn't anything to do with Tony and Brandy. That's a big one you hear [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3796.08s)]
*  all the time that Tony didn't sign Brandy. No, Brandy had been re-signed. Roads to the Top. We [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3802.24s)]
*  had a nice show on TBS that had been renewed for a second season. Go Big Show, which I was doing [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3807.2799999999997s)]
*  with Bert Kreischer and Snoop. You're killing it. You have all these other things are also leaving. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3812.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if people realize that, but you had the reality show, the show that you're hosting [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3818.16s)]
*  with Bert, and obviously you're a fixture and part of a VP of this wrestling organization. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3821.7599999999998s)]
*  So to leave all of that. Yeah, it was just a situation that felt icky. And this is how I [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3827.84s)]
*  kind of look at it in the end. I had really great memories with all of them, all the way back to [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3833.52s)]
*  All In, like the Woodstock of wrestling. I had a really beautiful experience for a while, and I [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3839.1200000000003s)]
*  wanted to keep the memories good. I wanted to be able in 10 years, if I see those guys or I wanted [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3845.36s)]
*  to keep them good. Yeah, I also wanted them to know this is the Louisiana Purchaser Wrestling [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3853.04s)]
*  Dog. I'll make sure. But I had great memories with them and I wanted them to know. Is it true [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3858.48s)]
*  that Vince flies to your house in Atlanta to pitch you on coming to WWE? Yeah, he found out through [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3868.2400000000002s)]
*  the dirt sheets, as we call them. We need a better name for our wrestling media, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3879.68s)]
*  but that's what we call them, the dirt sheets. Sounds like a ditty party. Oh my God. Yeah, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3883.52s)]
*  we really need a better name. He found out that I was free and free free. Nobody wanted to [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3888.72s)]
*  dabble. If you're not free, if this is a storyline, if this is a bit, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3895.04s)]
*  we don't need to be talking because that's trouble. So he found out I was free free and [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3898.72s)]
*  came to my house in Atlanta and it was really old school in terms of, hey, there's no promises [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3903.68s)]
*  beyond this is what we are considering. You wrestling Seth Rollins at WrestleMania 38 in [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3911.52s)]
*  Dallas. Seth Rollins was somebody I'd felt like I'd been chasing when I was there the first time [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3917.7599999999998s)]
*  and really old school scribbled on a piece of paper the amount of money the contract would be for [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3923.04s)]
*  and just slid it across, which was unnecessary. What was it? I can't tell you exactly how much [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3929.2s)]
*  it was. I can tell you it's, I mean, 15 times more than what I had been making in WWE at the [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3935.84s)]
*  first run. It was a different layer of- Of course, well, you've earned it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3945.04s)]
*  It was a different, it was a different, even with everything I'd done and I had with all those other [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3949.44s)]
*  shows, but this was hilarious that it was slid across to me. You guys are alone in your house. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3953.6s)]
*  Yes. Say it out loud. You can just say it. Just slid it across. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3958.16s)]
*  Yeah. You can't get out of character. It's impossible for them. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3962.16s)]
*  But that happened and I looked at that and I actually didn't, again, not the smartest. It [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3965.6s)]
*  wasn't really a money thing. It was, I thought this is huge if I'm, I own all this stuff, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3971.2s)]
*  the logo, my music, my look, my, most of the times you get caught in the aspect of that's ours, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3978.7999999999997s)]
*  these creations of yours. So many of little things I created don't belong to me. However, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3985.44s)]
*  this was created outside. This is one of the most random things here. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3990.08s)]
*  So I can bring this actual whole thing. So that was my concern. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3994.4s)]
*  This meaning the American nightmare. The American nightmare. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=3998.0s)]
*  The music is a big part of it. Every aspect of what I do, the fact that I'm not going to say [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4000.16s)]
*  title, I'll say belt, the fact I have to be me. And one of the quotes that was given to me in [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4005.44s)]
*  that meeting was it's not broke. That's why we're buying it. And I thought, okay, then we're on the [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4011.52s)]
*  same page. Because I really wanted them to know I was not, hey, I'm a grown up now, but I wanted [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4019.04s)]
*  them to know I've done a few things here. I've got a good command of what I can do and what I cannot [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4024.64s)]
*  do and almost overcompensated and explaining that to people so that they get like he's not to be [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4030.24s)]
*  trifled with these days. And I played my cards that way, I suppose. And the next thing you know, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4035.68s)]
*  there's like this three month period where now I'm off, shockingly have left this baby of mine, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4042.0s)]
*  this thing that I really loved to go back and go after the burst stream I had in the business, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4048.72s)]
*  which is what's been awkwardly sitting on my lap. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4054.8s)]
*  Was that interaction with Vince when he's at your house different than every other interaction you [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4059.04s)]
*  have with him, you know, growing up or even in the promotion the first time? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4062.8s)]
*  No, he was always really, again, I had a great experience because maybe it was respect for my [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4066.64s)]
*  family and not so much respect for me. So I was always treated with a quality. I think this one, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4071.8399999999997s)]
*  maybe it was different because I could talk to him about things that I had been educated on. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4079.04s)]
*  You're a big boy now. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4083.92s)]
*  Well, like I can talk to you about- [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4084.7999999999997s)]
*  You've also been in his shoes. You know what it's like to run a promotion. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4086.08s)]
*  I can talk to you about a format. I can talk to you about this silly, we timed this. I can talk to [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4088.4s)]
*  you about the overhead on Bill. I can talk to you about a few of these things. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4093.04s)]
*  You're not just an actor. You're a director. You're a producer. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4096.72s)]
*  Yeah, right. Which is one of the quotes from my original run in WWE. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4099.04s)]
*  I think it was Bruce Pritchard who told me this, but he said, you know, if you really get good at [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4104.56s)]
*  this job, you have to be your own wrestler, your own referee, your own commentator, your own [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4108.56s)]
*  cameraman. You have to know everything you're doing at all times. And these people with you have to [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4113.04s)]
*  know because then you'll be in control. And that was very much, it felt like one of those moments. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4117.36s)]
*  I thought in that meeting, I wasn't coming back though. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4121.6s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4123.68s)]
*  I thought in that meeting, it would be good to have a moment of, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4124.56s)]
*  okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. It feels good to be wanted. It feels great to be wanted [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4129.04s)]
*  and wanted by the place that helped raise me, my home. But I thought I was still going to go out. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4135.52s)]
*  Again, my plan looks like I had a plan. Everybody else, I was a total bluff. I didn't know what the [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4141.84s)]
*  plan was. I certainly could have gone back at that point. We certainly could have figured that [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4147.28s)]
*  out and been fine. But I just, something inside was pointing a different direction for me. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4153.36s)]
*  I think it was the slide. I think it was the camera. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4161.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It is really funny how you keep pretending it's not the money, but you've got 15x what you've [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4163.2s)]
*  got before. And you're like, I don't know why the theory of force was pulling me towards spirit. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4169.36s)]
*  A private banker. I have no idea. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4175.84s)]
*  It's always a great call though, when you can, for example, I get called brandy. I was like, hey, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4177.84s)]
*  you got to know what was just slid across on a piece of paper. You got to know. And just, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4184.8s)]
*  my wife is, she's a stone. Very little breaks her. And it's fun when you can hear like, wait, what? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4190.16s)]
*  Oh, wow. And just, we had to be really sure it was the right thing. Because remember, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4196.72s)]
*  I left there not on the best of terms. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4200.96s)]
*  So here's my curiosity. Are you getting pitched a storyline in that moment? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4202.72s)]
*  No. So people think there's a storyline. People think there's a contractual. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4206.96s)]
*  So all you have is Seth Rollins, WrestleMania. One match, one dollar figure. That's it. Under [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4210.64s)]
*  the idea that I would come in and be there for three years. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4214.88s)]
*  So, okay. They have the right to you for three years after that. And you get to take all your [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4217.6s)]
*  IP into WWE, which is kind of unheard of. Super complicated too. Nobody can do that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4221.2s)]
*  Now WWE's legal team. There's Disney World, right? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4226.56s)]
*  Oh my gosh. Wait, what do you mean? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4229.2s)]
*  Well, no, it was so complicated for them to be like, wait, he owns the song, but do we like? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4230.88s)]
*  Because they're used to creating the character and then owning the IP. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4237.04s)]
*  Even when those characters leave, they can't be their WWE version in other organizations [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4241.04s)]
*  a lot of times. Today you probably could because Nick Khan and Triple H are kind and open to the [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4246.72s)]
*  idea that, yeah, go take that. But back in the day. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4252.88s)]
*  It used to be very much, hey, if your finisher was the Crossroads and it was named on our show, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4255.36s)]
*  Michael Cole was the first to say it. You have no claim to that. What's a yeah. So, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4260.88s)]
*  but I brought everything of my own into it. And just to see them have to work it out, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4264.64s)]
*  to see them all have to kind of work hard legally. I thought, oh, that's cool. We're really [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4269.52s)]
*  they're really doing everything they can to get this and make this work. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4273.68s)]
*  So take it. Go, go out. Go. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4277.28s)]
*  One thing I don't understand about your time in AW as a VP, how come [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4278.4800000000005s)]
*  you couldn't challenge for the championship again? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4283.36s)]
*  Like who's idea? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4285.92s)]
*  Oh, it's a great. So I that's a great question. I had done two full storylines that I would say [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4286.56s)]
*  I completely oversaw. One was with Chris Jericho for the championship. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4293.92s)]
*  And Chris collaborated on that offered hugely to it. Tony as well. But that was like, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4298.320000000001s)]
*  here was my week one, week two, week three, week four. I was terrified of winning the championship, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4303.04s)]
*  even though there's kind of these revisionist history. The last year I was a bad guy. They were [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4309.360000000001s)]
*  they were booing me left and right. But those first two years, and especially those first few [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4315.2s)]
*  months, I was the hottest thing they had. And that was a great spot to be in. But my fear was [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4319.5199999999995s)]
*  if I win the title, I'm abusing this. You're abusing your power. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4325.2s)]
*  I'm the executive vice president. And my dad, who was the executive vice president and executive [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4328.08s)]
*  producer of Jim Crockett Promotions, he had won the championship and the people loved it. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4333.2s)]
*  But later the Meltzer's, the different and I'm not knocking Dave by any means, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4338.4s)]
*  but the industry journalists, that's something they looked at and they would judge. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4342.48s)]
*  And I would say it's a huge mistake that I went that route, because I was hot and the fans were [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4346.48s)]
*  happy. Oh, huge. So in my mind, I would I didn't want to do it. And we put ourselves in a situation [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4351.5199999999995s)]
*  where I can never challenge for it again. I remember it's wrestling. Clearly, you can go [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4357.2s)]
*  back on it. And I told him like, Nope, this is a never go back on. I want to make it clear. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4361.2s)]
*  I want to make my stories just as big as the world title, which was a problem in itself. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4366.16s)]
*  You might as well be world champion. But that story was the one I had a good control on. I'd [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4370.0s)]
*  look back at it and say, perhaps that decision was a mistake. But my heart was in the place of I [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4376.24s)]
*  didn't want fans to think I'm going to abuse this position. Clearly, I'm juiced into the office and [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4380.88s)]
*  helping lead this forward. I didn't want them to think I was that even though probably from a [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4386.8s)]
*  creative standpoint, it would have been just fine. I think it's a hold you that you can never go for [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4391.76s)]
*  the title again. Yeah. And once you're there, you got to have a ceiling. Once you're there, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4396.64s)]
*  I didn't realize how much of a ceiling that is for certain fans. To me, I thought, no, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4401.04s)]
*  you'll be fine with I'll do these really great stories that just don't revolve around the title. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4404.64s)]
*  Wrestling into the day. Sometimes it's not rocket science. It might just be about the title. You [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4409.280000000001s)]
*  know what I'm saying? Like, and it's not about the side, but having an end goal is exciting to [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4414.8s)]
*  people. 100% and knowing you can't ever get there, I think removes a little bit of that journey. And [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4419.280000000001s)]
*  the only way I could get there is by being a bad guy fully like, ah, screw that. I was a self [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4424.96s)]
*  imposed. Yeah. And I was okay. I understand that as the misstep. I do think not being able to get [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4429.52s)]
*  the title adds to your lore for when you know what I mean? So I think I think it worked out in the [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4435.92s)]
*  long run because we constantly are rooting, right? Like give this guy a fucking chance. Why can't I [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4442.4800000000005s)]
*  get it? And it will come in later WB again. It was all about the title. Resume in 39 and in LA at [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4446.64s)]
*  SoFi. Everyone's thinking this is it. Well, I want to get to that. So after 38, the Rollins [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4451.28s)]
*  match, like, I mean, there's just this awesome moment where he's standing there. He's kind of [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4456.32s)]
*  sitting there and like, does he know how long the delay is going to be? I don't think, I don't think [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4460.16s)]
*  Seth knew he was going to be in the ring that long. I mean, before the lights go out, he's there. And [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4464.5599999999995s)]
*  then it looks like he's like, then he starts going, stop making me wait. But he literally, I feel [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4469.84s)]
*  like he's going, guys, what the fuck? Stop making me wait. If he said it, he 100% minute, let's go. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4475.84s)]
*  And then the lights go out. And then people, I feel, thought it might be you, but they didn't [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4481.280000000001s)]
*  believe that it could be. To me, I didn't believe it could be. I just went out and did all this. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4487.84s)]
*  And also I was worried you're going to boo me. Like I started the other place with my buddies, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4494.400000000001s)]
*  and then we went head to head with NXT and really took a lot of shots. I mean, my first [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4500.240000000001s)]
*  PLE there, I smashed a facsimile of Triple H's throne just to let people know, hey, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4505.76s)]
*  this is the direction I'm going. But when I walked out, it didn't matter to them. It was weird. When [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4511.76s)]
*  I walked out at Mania, you can see for about 40 seconds, I'm in a trance. I'm blown away that [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4518.0s)]
*  they're jumping, like not just cheering, but jumping up and down. I wanted that my whole life. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4526.0s)]
*  I don't know. I haven't been in a WWE ring. They're different types of rings. I haven't [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4532.240000000001s)]
*  even trained in a WWE ring. I haven't been one in eight years at this point or whatever. Just [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4536.16s)]
*  every step I'm in this trance. And the feeling I got was, it just felt like the brother, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4540.4800000000005s)]
*  our kid who was part of the family hadn't been home, just walked back in the door. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4547.52s)]
*  That's what it felt like. Young and old fans were like, nah, he's cool. He's cool. He grew up here. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4551.68s)]
*  So you get the positive reaction from the fans. Do you in that moment go, okay, I'm a face? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4558.400000000001s)]
*  Or are you unsure of what you're going to be? I'm forever unsure. So starting this whole [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4564.4800000000005s)]
*  conversation, like, yes, 100% white me baby face. I am forever unsure. And I tell people in charge [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4572.4800000000005s)]
*  that Triple H, who's been so good to me, I tell him this all the time. I say, hey, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4579.52s)]
*  I don't have a good compass anymore because I don't know what's right, what's wrong because [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4583.68s)]
*  I did it all now. I've gone around the spectrum. Maybe I do and I don't admit it, but I feel like [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4589.84s)]
*  my compass isn't as great. So I rely on you. If you think this is the play, that's where the [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4594.72s)]
*  quarterback terminology came up. I'll run it. And the play hasn't been wrong yet. So I like going [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4600.400000000001s)]
*  that strategy just because in that moment I had lost a lot of my compass. Even that great reaction, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4606.8s)]
*  that moment, I still thought, well, this story will evolve. Seth has every right and every reason [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4611.44s)]
*  to gripe. He's been here waving the banner. One of the greatest ever do it. WrestleMania 40's MVP [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4617.2s)]
*  is Seth Rollins. He has every right to chew me up and spit me out on the mic and I'd have to just [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4622.4s)]
*  take it. I'd have to just take it. And they just, again, the fans didn't care. And a lot of little [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4627.599999999999s)]
*  kid fans, they're not interested in it anyway. It's not more in peace. They just, let's blow some [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4633.44s)]
*  stuff up and hit some cool moves. But yeah, no, I was very lucky. Guys, this is very important. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4638.8s)]
*  I need, we need to stress something right now. This is the last episode that comes out before [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4644.400000000001s)]
*  the end of our democracy. Yeah. Okay. I don't know who's going to end it, but according to the [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4648.400000000001s)]
*  internet, no matter who wins, the democracy is ended. Yeah. Yeah. No. You can feel your girls [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4652.96s)]
*  cooked. Right. When CNN is fighting, bro, when CNN, when Anderson Cooper is out there struggling, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4660.96s)]
*  the best man or woman will win. Say again? The best man or woman will win. You mean that? No. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4669.52s)]
*  It's not looking good. It's not looking good. And Trump is on Saint Rogan's today. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4676.8s)]
*  Apparently Trump is on Rogan today. We recorded this Friday. Let's see it. We got to see it when [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4681.92s)]
*  these things happen. Kamala was supposed to go on Rogan and that's not to happen. What do you think [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4688.0s)]
*  happened? Pussy. Or she wants to stay in the battleground states where it actually matters [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4691.44s)]
*  because that's going to win her the election. That actually is a good point being that she's [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4697.52s)]
*  in Texas and specifically Houston and Austin this weekend. Maybe she is. I love it when people- [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4701.12s)]
*  Because I do as well as that too. I don't think she is though. She's in Fri. She's in Houston. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4708.72s)]
*  She's supporting the guy who's going up against Boogerlip. What's his name? Boogerlip. What? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4712.0s)]
*  Cruz or whatever his name is. Remember Boogerlip? And then she's going to be in Austin as well. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4718.24s)]
*  She's there. She could literally go down the block and just make it happen. Also who's ever not voted [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4723.6s)]
*  for someone because they don't spend more time in your state? I thought the same thing but- [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4727.2s)]
*  No that shouldn't affect it. Really? If it didn't affect it they wouldn't all be there. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4731.2s)]
*  But what is the thinking? Like oh they weren't in my state for two weeks. I don't get it. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4734.56s)]
*  There's still people that are undecided. So it's like imagine you speak to somebody face to face [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4739.36s)]
*  that might win you over with this guy every time he meets a person. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4743.84s)]
*  The president of the moment. Exactly. Why are you voting for Killy Rhodes? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4747.92s)]
*  I'm voting for honestly the Undertaker. That's what should happen. And the winner is lights go out. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4753.12s)]
*  Undertaker there. Trump and Kamala. Oh that was fine. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4760.88s)]
*  Yeah I don't know. But listen you can bet on it with stake if you want. Put your money up. Put [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4766.32s)]
*  your money where your mouth is bro. Put your money where your mouth is. Let's go. You put [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4770.96s)]
*  your money up too. Put your money where Kamala's mouth is. That's the president you're talking [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4774.56s)]
*  about. That's first of all the vice president but what her mouth is is saying she's gonna win so [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4780.24s)]
*  put your money on her mouth. Why are you saying this? It sounds weird. Put your money on her mouth. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4783.92s)]
*  Stop arguing with me. Why? You're saying that you're saying that people will put money on [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4788.88s)]
*  Donald's mouth? I'm just saying. Some say that her mouth got her places. Wow I can't believe you [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4792.4s)]
*  so close to the election. You've been watching CNN. CNN has turned into alt-right news network. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4799.6s)]
*  CNN is an alt-right news network. Unlike this show. Not this show. We have no bias [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4804.96s)]
*  whatsoever. We're straight down the middle. Yeah we just put our money on her mouth. If Fox does the [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4810.64s)]

*  that has a 50% chance of winning can win? Do you really think Trump and Kamala are running in this shit? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4866.88s)]
*  You really think? Yo I think Trump has a chance too bro. Now you're talking. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4871.92s)]

*  more decorum. If you want to bet on this election you're obviously doing a stake. Stake is the leader [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4915.68s)]
*  in global betting and you are social casinos. Bet on top sports and political events and use the [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=4919.92s)]

*  It's a Dumbledore arm. Yes. Yes. Yeah. But I think it adds to the lore. Yeah it does. Right? It's like [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5120.08s)]
*  this guy's actually Ernie. It's not just nepotism. It's not just a last name. He's actually Ernie [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5126.0s)]
*  of stripes and it's a rare moment in wrestling where something real is happening in something fake. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5130.48s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? To me that's my whole my whole story. These are perhaps this is [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  an artificial world perhaps. Yeah. But I'm real. I'm real. And this was a case of I so many people [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5143.76s)]
*  were really cool to me about like I can't believe it. And I feel like truthfully anybody who's got a [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5149.92s)]
*  competitive spirit at all would have done it. I love that people like this is crazy. I can't believe [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5157.12s)]
*  you did it. But I just feel like there was a sold out crowd. There was all this interest in that [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5163.52s)]
*  PLE via Peacock that of course they had told us about. Hey we're 40% up on this hell in the cell [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5167.76s)]
*  and it's Seth again someone I have such a respect for. I just here's the part they don't know. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5173.2s)]
*  Had somebody seen it I made sure nobody saw it. The only person who saw it was a guy named Peaches [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5180.08s)]
*  who's the trainer at WWE. And Peaches I think wasn't under the impression I was wrestling. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5188.5599999999995s)]
*  We'll tape you up. So WWE doesn't even know that you did it. They know I tore it. They know I tore it. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5195.76s)]
*  And the doctor who had looked at it said he can't hurt it any worse. It's gone. He has strength in [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5201.6s)]
*  his arms. It's gone because they did double check over and over like is this even possible that he [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5207.92s)]
*  can do it. They went through every little they went to an outside doctor even who ended up doing [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5212.8s)]
*  my surgery like yeah he's he can wrestle. At the end of the day they're liable if you can't hurt [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5217.76s)]
*  one. If something happens right. And I just but I kept my jacket on. I kept my jacket on the whole [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5221.76s)]
*  day and I remember like Michael Hayes who is a legendary producer at WWE has been very helpful [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5227.6s)]
*  in my career especially this latter half of it. But he asked to see it and I started to unzip my [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5234.0s)]
*  jacket a little bit and he goes no no no save it. Save it. Like yeah yeah yeah. No no no. So the [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5239.52s)]
*  first time the first time everyone's seen it is when the jacket gets unbuttoned. And at this point [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5245.92s)]
*  it's healed enough for you to fight but it still looks this bad. I mean it's not healed at all. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5250.08s)]
*  Like three days after. So this is I have a progression of the bruising throughout. It was [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5254.64s)]
*  like a tiny bruise in my armpit and then it was coming down my arm and then it just got bigger [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5258.96s)]
*  and bigger to the point where I thought wow there's a lot of blood in there. The only thing that came [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5263.04s)]
*  of the match I was told and again could be a Cody lie but it didn't come from me was that when they [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5268.160000000001s)]
*  opened me up on the table in Birmingham after the match because I went got surgery immediately after [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5273.68s)]
*  the blood squirted up like for a prolonged three or four seconds not just the normal amount. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5278.24s)]
*  Definitely Cody Lie but I love it. That's great. That's a huge fan. Blood squirted to the ceiling. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5284.4s)]
*  Still on the ceiling right. The doctors were in poncho. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5289.84s)]
*  But yeah that was a that was I wasn't not gonna do it. I had to this day I would. Fans really [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5295.76s)]
*  appreciate it. Yeah and if they weren't on the fence like if they were on the fence and weren't [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5301.44s)]
*  sure about me I always say like it's a peck well spent that this was what they said like yeah no [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5305.6s)]
*  he's cool. He's okay. So you keep on building this trust and appreciation in the fans and in these [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5310.72s)]
*  like real moments in this thing that everybody accepts that is fake. I think one of the Sam [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5316.0s)]
*  Roberts who's a fucking awesome friend of mine. I hate Sam. Yeah I'm sure you do. He's dead to me right now. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5320.88s)]
*  He went on a whole rant about my title run and he technically works for WWE. He's trying to [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5325.68s)]
*  play that line of like nah I'm independent. No you're not Sam. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5330.64s)]
*  So I'm a Rosenberg guy right now because Sam's dead to me. Who's Rosenberg? Peter Rosenberg. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5338.400000000001s)]
*  Peter does a radio show in New York and he also Sam and him do our pre-shows and our kickoff panels [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5343.4400000000005s)]
*  because they do have an element of like this is their own flavor and they've been covering [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5349.4400000000005s)]
*  wrestling. That's cute. He's a wrestling guy? Yeah. Oh wow. Peter Rosenberg. He's really good. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5352.4800000000005s)]
*  Doesn't say anything mean about me. Yeah. White me guys. Okay so basically you have this situation [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5357.360000000001s)]
*  where he says what I thought was really interesting about wrestling is that like we [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5365.52s)]
*  know everything in life is fake right? We know politics is fake, people lie, whatever, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5370.160000000001s)]
*  but they pretend it's real. Wrestling is the thing that they admit is fake. So we don't have to [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5375.12s)]
*  feel gaslit at all. We just get to have pure enjoyment in it and then every once in a while [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5382.88s)]
*  in it there are these real moments and then the audience is like. They feel way more real. Way [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5388.400000000001s)]
*  more real because it was supposed to be fake. So when you see the armpit, when you see the story, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5393.52s)]
*  finish the story, when that is said for the first time, who says it for the first time? Michael Cole. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5398.72s)]
*  So Cole goes he's here to finish the story. Yep. Now all of a sudden the fans goes holy [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5403.2s)]
*  shit this is a real thing. He could finish the story. He could bring the belt to the Rhodes [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5409.04s)]
*  household. So now they're on board on something real within something they know is fabricated. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5414.8s)]
*  I like fabricated but do you see me wince every time? Yeah I'm sorry. No. No no. I don't mean it [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5421.68s)]
*  in a insulting way. No no. So I never get as a kid that was like the and my dad didn't smart me [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5427.36s)]
*  up to the business. So multiple fights as in an elementary school where hey Cody got into a fight [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5434.8s)]
*  and why? Because Tommy said you know what his dad does for a living is the f-word and of course my [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5440.96s)]
*  dad would not just help that. Instead he had a weird three strike rule like hey tell him you know [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5446.400000000001s)]
*  okay next time tell him hey that's how we make a living please leave me alone. Third time you just [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5452.72s)]
*  punch him in the nose and he's like always the nose. It's a really violent thing for a like kid [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5456.72s)]
*  to like think about like punching a guy in the nose. But so the reason. You stomp your feet when [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5460.8s)]
*  you punch him. So I'm all yeah wind up. The big round up. Crossroads. I'm uh it's not that when people use the word it doesn't it doesn't bother me but [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5465.68s)]
*  for me and I mean this in the utmost sincerity I always tell people it's 100% real and what I mean [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5475.92s)]
*  to like extrapolate on it what I mean is whatever I do tonight in Barclays by the way or whatever I [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5482.64s)]
*  do at any show if I see a dad with his son if I see a family if I see casual fans this is their first time [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5489.68s)]
*  their experience is real that's why that's always worked for me and like their experience is real [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5497.52s)]
*  and yes every now and then wrestlers get super defensive about it you've seen so many like news [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5503.92s)]
*  news interviews gone gone wrong. Well I broke my neck for this you know like I mean the David Schultz [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5510.240000000001s)]
*  one. Right. Oh slapping the guy backstage. Yeah. I slapped him pretty hard too. Knocked him down. Yeah I never I never get mad at it as much as it's just [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5514.72s)]
*  for me like maybe I'm different in our world where it's just because I'm not playing anything but myself [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5523.84s)]
*  it just feels as real as anything else. I think one of the best things that happened to wrestling [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5531.280000000001s)]
*  is for the public to to know that it is what what is the word? Fabricated. Organized. Yeah. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5536.16s)]
*  Predetermined because now we can submit ourselves to the fun and focus on these storylines and the [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5543.52s)]
*  storylines are what always would drive it in my opinion whereas before you could be like oh this [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5550.56s)]
*  is I mean I have video of this I don't even know if I can share this because my wife will be embarrassed [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5555.6s)]
*  we were watching the Vince doc and my wife is like kind of on her phone overhearing it and she goes [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5559.68s)]
*  wait it's fake this is like two weeks ago. Got her. This is two weeks ago. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5563.92s)]
*  Okay I have video of this I swear I don't even know if you can include this in the episode. She goes wait what do you mean? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5571.360000000001s)]
*  I go what did you think was happening? I don't blame her at all. You think there's a guy named The Undertaker? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5577.360000000001s)]
*  The Undertaker just comes back to the West. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5581.68s)]
*  Shuts off the power. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5583.68s)]
*  The whole town is saying. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5585.68s)]
*  I get it though because I remember being a kid and then someone you know making me feel like Santa Claus isn't real that moment with wrestling but I'm so invested that even after I'm like nah some of it's real. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5587.68s)]
*  It liberates the art though. It makes it I think so much more special because you get to focus instead of trying to focus on convincing people that this thing is 100% real you get to focus on convincing them what they're feeling is real. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5601.68s)]
*  Forget what they're seeing. I don't care if the punch lands. When that person comes out or you hear that music for the first time or this story is actually realized that's the fucking reaction you're going to get. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5617.68s)]
*  Shawn Michaels is really good and he heads up NXT now and I'm blown away by the next generation of wrestlers all going to be the best ever because they're being trained by Shawn Michaels but he always was of the thought that if they think that match that went on second or third wasn't real or if they feel disconnected from it I'm going to find something in mine that makes them think oh no everything else. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5627.68s)]
*  That wasn't that was fabricated that was artificial everything else but that he was mad he really you know like Shawn is the master of that and I wish more wrestlers and again it's a hard skill set to make but there's so many if you look at Shawn's career there's all these matches where you'll see stuff like oh I heard they were really having a problem with this I heard there was a behind the scenes no. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5649.68s)]
*  He was that good to make you think I mean every like the greatest and again when the lie you know when the fact becomes legend print the legend but Shawn is really special at doing that really special. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5669.68s)]
*  Okay so you get this at what point are you pitched the storyline of winning the Royal Rumble and then losing to Roman. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5681.68s)]
*  So it was never said it was never said you'll be winning or losing and I think. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5690.68s)]
*  Wait against Roman or. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5693.68s)]
*  Yeah we that was that the discussion was something that those discussions happen within days of WrestleMania. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5694.68s)]
*  So you're constantly reacting to what the audience wants and not by you I mean like the writing team. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5701.68s)]
*  Yeah I mean we have the again I don't know like we have the greatest focus group every week it's a literal live audience that it's you know I one of the things I talked with Bert about on the set ago big show was he would find that there was this parallel between pro wrestling and he'd try these jokes out and try these bits out and he'd know where they land. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5706.68s)]
*  What landed he'd build through his big finish all this and it's very similar in terms of every week we have them to we want to lead them for sure but also every now and then they'll they'll yank you like yeah we're not into that that's not it and it's a nice balance they are playing the backup to you if you're the lead singer they're right there it's very different from any other artistic medium that there is in terms of they we depend on them. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5723.68s)]
*  COVID wrestling is the worst. It's the worst. There might there were no fans there might have been good stuff that happened but none of us will ever want to go back and watch it. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5747.68s)]
*  Nobody it's hard to predict what they want what they write you need that live audience there they're the lifeblood and right now WWE is in this unbelievable Renaissance where these crowds are absurd. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5756.68s)]
*  You know we're talking about 10,000 for all in and how special that was now we're dealing with every show is 10 plus every like you know again and don't take it for granted who knows who that's gonna end but there are really great metric to determine they're the number one more than you know the guy who trained me his name is Al Snow I remember him telling me he's like you can get over with your boss and that's cool that'll get you places but you could also get over with the people and that'll get you everywhere and I love because that's honest yeah like great yeah I didn't have to politic or be your [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5767.68s)]
*  buddy but you know I played a game a little bit but if the people are vibing we're good you'll be I'm gonna move forward but yeah those discussions happen within days so you win real rumble yeah you don't know if you're gonna realize this dream if you're gonna finish the story of 39 yeah and I don't even mean to give this answer is gonna sound like a Cody lie but this is a true answer we didn't really know for sure what we were doing until hours before that match do you talk to Roman does age come in and talk to you guys like what that was that was one where it [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5797.68s)]
*  that's again you call the play that's triple H in terms of you you lead the charge that's not something he or I can determine Roman or I are are Mr. Heyman that's that he is he is directing this film are you fucking heartbroken yeah like I did everything to get here we can give the fans what they want you're gonna take that away from me what are you feeling before that even like when you're not sure what's gonna happen what's that whole process I think I went to a place in my mind and maybe I was feeling really positive maybe I will maybe I had experienced enough [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5827.64s)]
*  heartbreak in the business to to not be heartbroken again but what it what it became was I truthfully told myself and I had a really good individual step in and speak to me about this I told myself great I'm still gonna be the champion I'm gonna be the champion for the next year because Roman had select dates and he had done the full-time schedule before so he earned his select dates but he's not there every week I will be there every week I'm at every live event every house show every tour every appearance I'm at every [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5857.64s)]
*  time everywhere so I'm gonna be the champion of WWE without the title and that became the task and the hardest part of the task was they care so much now no way with the attention spans being will they care at 40 no way I know you think you're wrestling him at 40 but no way can you get there and then of course the greatest hurdle of all hurdles right when it does look like no we're going won the Royal Rumble again Steve Austin Shawn Michaels here are back-to-back Rumble winners [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5887.64s)]
*  I want it twice pointed at Roman we're going this is as real as real gets and the Rock shows up and that maybe I don't want to use the term heartbroken but that might be the most dejected for a moment explain what happens when the Rock comes in I can't believe we've jumped over getting you building you back up after 39 like you got to go in with Brock they have to design a way to make people believe no [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5917.64s)]
*  he can go after it you have these legendary matches with the Rock so Brock what gives you the rub right he very much so he very much three three with him again like the f-word is terrifying when discussing him because that's like if basically if you if we all left this room and you stood in there were like all right man we're sending in a bear see if you can just get behind the bed just get behind the bed that's like what wrestling Brock was like just see if you can get just if you can grab him just grab him once for ten kicks you in the stomach once that looked very buddy did you feel so [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5947.64s)]
*  yeah I like the lore of him is that he is is the most just crazy outrageous strong greatest athlete he could end anybody in a moment yeah I'll ruin it for some his professionalism is so underrated oh wow he is he is one of if not the most professional and understanding of what we wanted what and I he sent me some of his [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=5977.64s)]
*  he he has a farm in Canada I hope hope you're not mad at me for sharing this but he sent me an entire cow [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6005.76s)]
*  worth of stakes and he took a picture of himself with the cow because he does it all he's a real farmer love it so I thought this is the what I'm just a legend but yeah no he was the utmost professional with me I was I was I was blessed to have been in that role and again like the bear [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6013.88s)]
*  conversation about I I had to find something you know like he's not giving anything easily and that's the bad the best guys don't give anything easily so they put you against the meanest baddest dude yeah the audience sees you in these battles they start to support you again you know that you have to show out in these moments [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6035.12s)]
*  in these moments oh you have to show out more than you did because now they're seeing you every like I said there's a downside to seeing you every week too oh that's right we get used to you we really this is our end I just they stayed in it all the way including winning the Royal Rumble having gone through matches with Brock J. Uso and I had formed a partnership and that was the first little tease that we might go to Roman again and then Roman WrestleMania 40 and the next thing you know that's when Rock showed back up and that was a match a lot of fans had wanted to see [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6052.44s)]
*  for a long time so Rock says what when he throws the wrench he comes out well the way we designed it and now I'm everyone blames me for this and but I thought I thought I'd done the best I could I was still going to wrestle Roman but it wasn't going to be a WrestleMania so I was going to do just a handoff amongst myself and you know Rock is revered who doesn't love the Rock and and I was Birmingham Alabama and I went out and said hey I'll you know [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6082.36s)]
*  I am coming for that title but not a WrestleMania and one of the guys that took counsel with this guy's you know we didn't really say he's gonna be WrestleMania moment we clearly framed it up Rock's music hits the place loses their minds you know Birmingham Alabama's going bananas and him and I had an embrace he told me something super sweet in my ear that I'm sure he doesn't mind me sharing even though we're not best buddies but he he said we're gonna make both our dads proud and I like [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6112.36s)]
*  smiled for a brief moment and then he stole the title from you well then I left and for some reason I'm not blaming anyone for production they kept filming me like guys I'm not gonna be like go get him you know what I'm saying like I didn't have a face so I got kind of like a resting bee face like it's just everyone judged and picked apart ever like his he's heartbroken he's dejected and I guess I was but also I didn't want them to know that and I did this thing where a gorilla position which is the bright before you go out the backs of his position I didn't want [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6142.36s)]
*  anyone to see me like that so this might have been I skipped around it and went right to my bus just I had told Triple H and everybody hey I'm just gonna be private I don't want to have a meltdown I don't have a moment let that's it they're going there they're going there when they film me on my bus after this documentary because WWE films everything at any point a story could be taking place you know when they film me I'm sitting there with a giant bottle of Wheatley vodka and that's because Wheatley sponsors the bus and we do a podcast [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6172.36s)]
*  with Wheatley it's not because I was drinking this bottle just straight up but the way it looks is like all that was missing was like me eating pizza it's just like it was just a it was a sad image yeah and then that's that's the point what does the audience do when the rock says craziest thing that's ever happened and so here's the best part about it in in my mind I'm thinking what can I do right what can I do should I pursue being angry at [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6202.36s)]
*  this what can I do should I just move on to the next thing at this point in my life I think I just need to be a professional it's a rare yeah moment of maturity like yeah I'm they've got some plan I'm gonna go with their plan and almost defeated now I hate thinking of myself thinking that way my wife is like burn it down you know but I did nothing and there's little movements or and I say little movement because it was just a social media thing at first it was just this we want Cody thing on social media and then [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6232.36s)]
*  they even reacted to us so that's where it became okay the the we want Cody thing was happening online the video of them becoming WrestleMania opponents had the most dislikes those these little metrics but in my mind being Roman Reigns in the right so they set up this match yeah in my mind I thought like that you know digital and social is where people go to complain anyway so you know maybe it's just just that then first night on Monday Night Raw live in the arena there in st. Louis is where Seth of all people is talking [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6262.36s)]
*  about the rock and those were the booze came in people started booing and that's where we saw the we want Cody signs and I mean had this been a marketing plan it would have been genius but it wasn't completely organic it was a real thing provided by the fans and it's over the course of that week that it could have really emboldened me but I was still of the thought like guys as sweet as this is nothing we can do there's nothing we can do it's done I have to find it's done and then I feel comfortable sharing all this because we we have the [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6292.36s)]
*  behind the curtain WrestleMania documentary but it is rock and Triple H who decided okay we're gonna go with him oh wow now we're gonna go with we're gonna go with Cody they want that we're going with them important variable in this story and this is where wrestling has these real moments yeah a few months before that the Rock gets named to the TKO board of directors director of the board he's the director of the board TKO is the company that owns WWE and UFC so the [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6322.36s)]
*  perception of the Rock is no longer just this wrestler he's what is it now the final boss I mean he's the boss and then he became the final boss but he's the boss and a boss swooping in using his power position to take away the opportunity from a hardworking guy that has truly earned it and the people reject that they're like fuck I've been in that situation where the fucking boss takes this opportunity or hire some random friend instead of me and I'm gonna bust in my ass at this [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6352.36s)]
*  fucking company so the people project the Rock in this new position I wonder if the Rock is just a wrestler how they react but seeing him in his a power position abusing his power creates this empathy and like desire for you to fulfill the audience's dream ironically a smart thing you didn't do is react at all let them react so I in his you know again not the best best of buddies but in his defense [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6382.36s)]
*  I think Rock has become so busy the amount of stuff his output is incredible his work ethic his output I don't think he knew so much about the current landscape he knows that company backwards and forwards it's company that he I mean the show's called Smackdown because he said that word he is he had set the table for everybody but I don't think he was always keeping an eye on the table and I think over the course of that week and I could be wrong again I'm so [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6412.36s)]
*  glad that he did see oh okay it's bigger he leaned in right he called your fans to Cody cry baby he fucking turned he in he went on Pat McAfee called them Cody cry baby and then not just turned into a bad guy a lot of people thought oh we're getting Hollywood Rock back Hollywood Rock was one of his great iterations he no he went a whole nother way with the final boss which again in our world of suspension of disbelief is not remotely untrue he is the boss [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6442.36s)]
*  yeah he he dictates the shots and yeah did that I'm glad that's a byproduct of the WrestleMania 40 you know situation because it was a mess that week was was a mess at that point anything could happen one of those lists could have showed up back on social media again anything could have happened the world was I didn't know I wanted to be mature I wanted to be different I'd hey I told you guys I'm different but also I was just I was in my mind getting more reckless getting more [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6472.36s)]
*  you know no I did earn it this time I did and again it's entertainment but it just felt like WrestleMania is a Super Bowl imagine you're the team and you win every game you're supposed to go to Super Bowl yeah no you that's the part where I just I couldn't understand like so what is my plan because I can't understand this one because winning that winning the title maybe the second hardest thing in the business the hardest thing is main eventing WrestleMania that's that's like getting elected into the highest office in our business just a very big task and I had done it once and was so proud [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6502.36s)]
*  but again greedy I wanted number two and I wanted to finish yeah what a number one was Empire Strikes Back let's get to Jedi you know I'm saying let's finish this and it was a it was a tricky week so you devise this thing where you and of all people Seth Rollins my guy have this tag team match against the Rock and Roman Reigns yeah and then you end up fighting Roman of course but the winner gets to decide what that fight is gonna be [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6532.36s)]
*  yeah it was if the final boss and Roman won it would go into bloodline rules right just means there's no rules no rules which is awesome yes you said this twice you and the Rock aren't the best of friends like you guys have some beef behind his ears no I just I just I think when a situation like that happens and it's very real about yeah hey this fans have made a choice yeah and you know it's very real I think there's just a lingering a lingering tension perhaps and he's probably used to being he's been universally loved for decades [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6562.36s)]
*  straight I universally love him I'm I grew up there also might be some wrestling going on here I grew up I grew up I grew up I sincerely might be storytelling happening I say I'd like to be the reason I might say that is because I'd love to we have yet to debrief on WrestleMania and what happened because I bet you his story is a little different right I feel like there's probably people like no they're definitely you're there. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6592.36s)]
*  They're going with you they're going I think maybe some bad advice came or maybe didn't get a good knowledge of hey here's the current layout here's who's sitting at that table but I'd love that one day if we can ever have this little debrief just to explain because I never wanted to do anything in secret I never wanted to do anything behind the scenes because truth is when that happened you start thinking oh I could what if I told such-and-such this story with no no you can't you know I got very defensive it's crazy I'm in that moment he was the people's jet [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6622.36s)]
*  I'm a skill of rock has that that people's champ title too it's a it's very popular in the locker room his people's because it's it's his title like you might you might need to fight for that one you know okay okay so the main event happens you guys fight Seth plays this pivotal role I thought this was like great storytelling his knee completely shredded too no way if you watch it in slow-mo when he gets hit with a chair have you ever had like MCL PCL ACL any of that your knee wobbles so when he falls [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6652.36s)]
*  on the rope his knee literally wobbles horizontally it's absurd his knee was toast oh really yeah that guy's the man dude now he was toast yeah the matches with you and him are great because and I wonder if this net happens naturally the more you wrestle with somebody the better the chemistry yeah it's a rep yeah yeah the first time you're as well somebody you hit each other square in the face like buddy how are we doing this on a regular yeah no it's when you're in there with someone who's as good as him then you have the best dancing [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6682.36s)]
*  partner on earth yeah you can feel where they want to go you know dad train him yeah my dad trained Seth to degree to help them with promos he was their promo coach and character coach at NXT so it was him Roman Becky Sammy Kevin Owens and they all had this name that I effing hated which was Dusty's kids because I'm thinking like it's weird because like I'm his son yeah like but yeah no I I got over that after a while I've all of them have now been told like I hated this [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6712.36s)]
*  by the way guys you know all right guys let's take a break for a second because sleep is very important okay I mean that sincerely I know how important it is because I haven't gotten any of it in about eight and a half months ever since my wife brought our beautiful baby girl into this world I would love to get some sleep okay how do you maximize sleep how do you maximize the amount of sleep time that you have okay eight sleep has figured it out eight as in the number eight sleep they're buzzworthy sleep technology is called the pod let me just [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6742.36s)]
*  explain this okay it is so important when you're sleeping that the temperature of your body is regulated and they basically figured out some people make these mattresses they even have a mattress option the problem is most people aren't going to buy a brand new mattress without trying it's uncomfortable thing for them to get into they've developed a sheet that does all of that I can get into technical details but essentially it is monitoring and adjusting your temperature and the body temperature that you have throughout the night to maximize your sleep [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6772.36s)]
*  it can end up giving you how much more sleep does it end up giving you potentially one more hour of quality sleep every single night think about that one more hour now there's also an adjustable base that fits between your mattress and your bed frame to add reading and sleeping positions for the best unwinding like if you snore for example the pod can detect your snoring and automatically lift your head by a few degrees to improve the airflow and stop your partner snoring it's absolutely amazing okay plus with pod for ultra they have imperceptible sensors that [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6802.36s)]
*  track your sleep time sleep phases HRV and heart rate with 99% tracking accuracy just add the pod for ultra easily to any bed and they also have their own beds if you want to take it that next step further you get after that as well so if you had to eat sleep dot com slash flagrant and use the code flagrant you get three hundred fifty dollars off the pod for ultra that's eight sleep dot com slash flagrant and use the code flagrant to get three hundred fifty dollars off the pod for ultra eight sleep currently ships to the United States Canada [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6832.36s)]
*  United Kingdom Europe and Australia alright guys we got a big announcement you know last year flagrant [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6862.36s)]
*  uh collabed with extra the best wallets in the game number one without a doubt and we had that flagrant extra wallet absolutely uh just a just a fucking pussy dripper [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6867.08s)]
*  uh i know that sounds like a wrestling move it's not it's literal vaginas dripping all over the street it's a problem there are some like flood areas like what do they call them like i think red hook brooklyn is like a flood zone right [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6878.679999999999s)]
*  and there was a thing where they were banning the extra wallets because there were these girls that would just puddle up these sections of red hook i mean the buses couldn't even stop i remember watching an old lady nearly drowned in pussy juice on the side of the street because of the puddle that was created because one guy took out his extra extra wallet right just took it out and then fuck the faucets it was faucets out there hurricane sandy has nothing on what an [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6891.72s)]
*  extra wallet will do to a brooklyn girl's vagina area we're doing it again that's right but much better this time because the new extra flagrant collab wallet exclusively features the blue chew tray this is a big deal you know you're getting these vaginas all drippy if you're getting these vaginas super wet and obviously you know as winter approaches maybe i'm you know they'll probably do some sort of like skating rinks or whatever there's going to be plenty different things that they can do i don't know the temperature the vagina juice freezes at i imagine it's very close to water it's possible that because of the the saline content [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6921.72s)]
*  it might be even colder we might need winter to get down into like the 20s or even teens to freeze up all that coochie juice that's oh you know and red hook the point that i'm trying to make is while those pussies are crazy wet you might need those boners that are only delivered by blue chew and they got the blue chew tray the blue chew tray perfectly fits your blue chew as part of the extra wallet i cannot tell you how genius we are [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6951.72s)]
*  it might have been the smartest thing see a lot of people do you know they'll create a cultural phenomenon right they'll have women literally drained out on the street they think these girls are zombies because there's no water left in their body but they're like now what do we do oh we'll just leave it there we'll just have the vaginas be super wet all around us shucks not us we're going to fill up those things that you got slip and slide it's time to try the number one rated smart wallet in the world stop fumbling for cards and never lose your valuables again try risk-free for 100 days for a limited time [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=6981.72s)]
*  get 30 off your extra flagrant collab wallet at partner.exra.com slash flagrant with the code flagrant that's partner.exra.com slash flagrant now let's get back to the show i mean the storyline is great seth comes on he stands up roman has to make this decision right between pinning you or taking out seth and roman has been so disciplined right this guy's been on a like a reign of terror it's just amazingly methodical wasn't always loved like they really tried to like shove him down [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7011.72s)]
*  the fans throats initially as like a hero and i think anytime the ww like tries to make somebody here the fans naturally reject it they're like you're not gonna tell us who to like kills at his heel unbeatable makes the decision to go hit the one fuck up in this reign the one time he gets emotional so seth in a way creates this opportunity for you great storytelling also a throwback to seth had hit roman with the chair when he left the shield so this is a and seth [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7041.72s)]
*  is dressed in the shield like there's all these stories like braiding together beautiful you do the finisher you do the crossroads three times then you pin them and then as the one two three is being said the guy was announcing it was sam no no no it was colin yeah colin yeah finish oh yeah colin's story i mean yeah it's like everybody's [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7071.72s)]
*  storyline came to this perfect ending in that moment even coles right he starts this finish the story idea and then he counts it out there's a there's a moment where i think was it stephanie that's calling what happened is samantha ervin the or samantha sorry sorry samantha her voice cracks yeah she was crying she's like it's this is real within fabrication this is the real moments you're looking for within what is orchestrated yeah she's getting she's like visibly or like auditorily oh yeah they had to mention it because [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7101.64s)]
*  she was shaking on her voice was shaking and she has a booming announcing voice yeah she's great yeah i mean it was yeah samantha sorry but it was like this beautiful moment yeah what happens i'll tell you what is the feeling i'll tell you a fun thing that happened that i i don't know if i've shared this but is one of the most magical again the artificial world what's real one of the most magical things i've ever seen is the undertaker showing up to choke slam the rock and that match yeah so [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7131.64s)]
*  in the moment i'm laying in the corner and a blackout on tv isn't always a blackout in the arena there's kind of a your eyes adjust so i see this man who is older now in his life and hasn't done this i'm rolling the ring at a speed like a wild animal like rolling the ring like oh my god the undertaker's huge so just the athleticism and this role is i'm totally in the dark and then i see him stand up then i feel the lights come up and now the whole world knows he's in there and they have their moment and he chokeslams the [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7161.64s)]
*  rock and kind of as the sheriff of wwe shows up and makes something right but then no one sees this he looked over at me and i think he wanted us to have a moment but i was still reeling from this whole match so i'm just kind of in no man's land not really looking there is no like clear cut camera shot but he looked at me and just literally just just went and winked and as soon as he winked i kid you not the lights went out and he and i thought like he's magical [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7191.64s)]
*  you know it was it was it was so unbelievable and then after the chair shot um there's like their brief moment i saw john so sena's got his back to the wall he had been part of it he's on the floor he's staying small as we say when like you kind of you can't get out of their arena so you're still out there and i got to make eye contact with him and this is his spot this is his spot that roman [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7221.64s)]
*  has now and any minute now it could be my spot and to have that moment with him was i don't know what he was thinking but in my mind i was hoping there was a belief that i could do it and just a bullet hey i wasn't wrong about this kid he he actually went and got it but those were all very real moments uh i charles robinson legendary referee he had tears in his eyes i again i going from us to me to 39 where i'm looking at this dejected fan base and trying to make eye contact with as many of them as i [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7251.64s)]
*  can basically saying like it's gonna be okay it's gonna be all right it's gonna be cool things happen you know doesn't always end the way we want to be able to have that like celebration and euphoria and it was like unlike any other celebration the closest i could think of was like wrestlemania 10 where all the guys came down and put bread on their shoulders and here's here's guys don't ever like helping each other out by the way if you ask somebody to be in a lumberjack match or do a pull apart nobody wants to know i want to be part of your segment yeah for them to want to be part of it wow and like randy is out [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7281.64s)]
*  there randy randy doesn't roll out of bed for anything for him to come out and put me up on his shoulders i like it's all what you're seeing is all 100 real yeah in that in in that moment and that was just it i don't rate it as like hey what's your top three matches because it wasn't i don't think of it that way and it's and i've never watched it back i've never watched it back fully i've never watched no the undertaker winked at me i don't want to see it not wink at me i want my memory of it print the legend [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7311.64s)]
*  print the legend for sure so i i remember it that way and it was just just just the wildest great like it sets the stage for wrestlemania 41 because we have to do that every time yeah you're right it sounds unrealistic sounds undoable but that's that's why i was in a legion stadium this week for the on sale and i'm thinking like what do we do yeah what do we do you know and like hunters the same way like what do we do next also very different landscape because roman is your buddy i don't know buddy is there is [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7341.64s)]
*  a face now he's a face but is he his i got to tell him something for the first time i got to say something to him for the first time because you'd be shocked if you came backstage you'd be like are they are they wrestling me right now like is this because we we just don't have any interaction oh really we don't it's not there's nothing i'm not saying anything negative about him he i've never heard him say anything negative about me um we understand where we play at in this world [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7371.64s)]
*  uh but i did get to tell him one thing before bad blood in atlanta um which is to me like i didn't it's the thing every wrestler wants to hear which was thank you for the house because that's i mean tickets were really good for atlanta we had sold out but then we sold out again you know just because you open up you open up you open up when he was introduced to the fray so i got that moment i got nothing back which which [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7401.64s)]
*  uh which you know it's a unique relationship every one you're gonna thank you for he did the house well i thought the tickets were free i was yeah i'll be honest maybe i was waiting for a thank you for that no it's it's fine it's he's incredibly special and done so much for ww and when people get on to him about the limited dates and stuff they don't realize he like he was the thing yeah for he did all this he's earned every everything he's got right now so sorry what's a not limited date schedule to let people know how much y'all are really going at it because i don't think people get i'm home two days [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7431.64s)]
*  this month yeah and you're wrestling wrestling uh because we did a full tour so we did five you know five matches overseas maybe two tv matches um wrestling far less than you're actually out on the road if you're not doing that you're doing a promo if you're not doing that to meet and greet if you're not doing that on sale all stuff we used to call out the john cena schedule it's all stuff you just want to go out when you when you hold the the north star to the game you want to go out and represent it represent it the best you can and [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7461.64s)]
*  you know that's thankfully my my wife came from the business she gets it she gets it and yeah man if she didn't she gets it plus you know if you whenever she wants to come on the road and everything like that but yeah you said you haven't spoke to roman you guys never squashed the beef when you were in a w like the tactical envy comments and the tweet oh that was even pre i don't think no we've never talked about any of that other two conversations i've wrestled this guy at two wrestlemania's two conversations [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7491.64s)]
*  one um telling him that i was coming on board and i was looking forward to it and uh maybe even apologizing about that and just saying hey the times were real yeah um and then the other was thank you for the house um yeah it's it feels like there's some wrestling going on you would be shocked i i wish more people come backstage and see just how real some of these relationships are your relationship with seth your relationship with uh roman rang [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7521.64s)]
*  it's very unique environment it really is and and i think it's the best environment because right now wwb is doing the best business that's ever done so if this tension and this competitive we want it you want it i got whatever is good for business i'm about it you hear about this with actors sometimes like i hear this story that maryl streep who plays like this giant bitch in devil wars product yeah really nice and hathaway the first time she meets her and then she goes i need you to know this is the last time i'm going to be nice to you for the next nine months she says she complimented her like i think you're great i think you're awesome [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7551.64s)]
*  also i'm not gonna be nice to you at all off camera on camera i'm barely gonna speak to you for the next nine months just letting you know great movies yeah great movie too yeah no that's the if that's the way you go into it that's the way you go into it yeah understood yeah hmm that's interesting so you have to kind of commit to the character and i think uh when we we say that's why i get why you guys bristle and when people say it's fake i do think it underplays the talent you guys have as athletes you do put your body through a lot yeah and also the [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7581.64s)]
*  character development and storytelling you guys have to do is insane it's on par with any actor comedian like it's it's really fucking impressive well he gave it the big the big high compliment high brow yeah i grew i grew up in a neighborhood where you know i was talking about being a little kid where people didn't look at it that way yeah they looked they looked down like i always refer to my family in my neighborhood like we were the adams family there was just they thought we were unique and weird and like there wasn't enough wrestling fans in that neighborhood to be like no these this is awesome these guys are cool you know and my [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7611.64s)]
*  dad didn't help matters used to go to the pool and his trunks and great man's that barely fit his head and post dots yeah there's 300 something pounds i remember you got on this diving board and he literally i think did it just to show the neighbors and did this like picture perfect dive up down got out of the pool when sat there ordered pizza like he always made a scene of himself and i thought okay you know mowed the grass randy organ in his trunks as well like the adams family thing was probably pretty accurate we were unique you know [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7641.64s)]
*  unique family [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7671.64s)]
*  free the generation of tanning beds every wrestler under the sun would find an excuse to take their shirt off whether they were in shape not in shape you had to be tan yeah that was like a thing so a lot of these old school wrestlers if there's one thing that happens outside for five minutes you'll turn around and like arn anderson's got his shirt off like what are you doing oh tan the tan come on man you know i was i was watching a lot of you know just clips in general and uh there's something i picked up on there were the there's the high flying like acrobatic moves [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7676.04s)]
*  yeah right and i don't know if those are as satisfying as like the moves that kind of tell a story sure so you were talking about the undertaker choke slam yeah to me that is cooler than someone doing like a triple backflip and what i'm trying to understand why that is you know i think it's so i'm of the belief it's both i love especially if you can do both you can do both but there's some that are [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7706.04s)]
*  too acrobatic well if you just do some again the guy who trained me out so he said like i love fireworks we go see fireworks once a year it's awesome fireworks once twice a year whatever maybe he would look at high spot wrestling the bigger flips the we call them high spots the really crazy stunts and he'd say they're fireworks it's not that they're not good but if there's no attachment to them it has to be an attachment to them so this is the big argument that wrestlers have like a lot of young and the gen z and i i have a wrestling school in georgia and i find this with a lot of the [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7736.04s)]
*  kids they want to do all the crazy stuff and i don't want to be the old like curmudgeon so i don't discourage do it do it all but please also like work on how you speak work on what that character might be open like open yourself up because if you do the moves make them worth it make them worth it if you do this really crazy move that could risk your neck and your back and you want to do it on every night at least let them love you or let them hate you so that it works for you and i feel the more um linked you get [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7766.04s)]
*  to the crowd there's a term in our business over you know um i don't think any of the young generation is over minus roman i think i think over is the can't step out of here without 50 people like stone cold yes i think there's a quoting everything you say i think there's a group of like a group of people who are getting over and they're on their way and what i've noticed hopefully kind of being in that group is that they care enough that you can do less and get more [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7796.04s)]
*  but when you say less is more to a 19 year old kid at the nightmare factory or someone who's been hustling on the indies for 10 years they think you mean be lazy i don't mean mean be lazy i mean fine you're great at that flip what's your catchphrase be efficient what's your thing what's your do something you know like promos used to be all the business was now it's a combination a little bit of it all but yeah it's tricky how you verbalize it to others there's an interesting thing i also noticed with the with some of your moves right the uh the crossroads move [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7826.04s)]
*  specifically it's i don't even know the terminology for this but you can reverse somebody's move into it yeah which is very exciting yeah like somebody's putting you in a suplex or whatever like that the opposite reaction is the crossroads it's the quickest path between two divergent stories right it's like he's about to get crushed it's over and he's on top he can finish the match yeah it is it literally is a misdirect so i want i've been trying to like reverse engineer [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7856.04s)]
*  a wrestler in my head yeah has wwe figured this out like what are the things that make a wrestler good or does there always have to be some authentic organic flair yeah i think recruitment is where you think authentic organic flair recruitment and this is all on [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7886.04s)]
*  Shawn Michaels triple agent Nick Khan this is kind of making up the future of wwe if they recruit a gymnast and they see Tiffany Stratton as a gymnast will use as an example they see her do her athletic stuff the gymnast element of it great they can code they try to coach the [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7905.16s)]
*  but one conversation can also say oh no there's a thing here there's a thing that's the most you can't just take we've actually had some athletes come in who are the greatest athletes you get d1 guys now and yeah but they didn't have that little that little thing you know that that Kurt Angle is the greatest example of all Olympic gold medal yeah but what did it for Kurt and people don't realize they don't look back is Kurt behind the scenes in these pre-tapes and in all kinds of promo segments was one of the funniest [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7923.16s)]
*  entertaining I remember that but the other thing is you knew like hey if I get into a fight Kurt Angle wins the fight he's an Olympic gold medalist so qualified so he literally had a both so Shawn and Hunter that's the thing you can't coach the the IT you can't the the thing that's in there you can't coach it IT like the it factor you know you can't coach it but I think you can maybe take a chance and okay they've got this they've got this and I think they've got something when you're creating your moves your signature moves [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7953.16s)]
*  are you thinking that no I just steal my stuff from other guys okay so like the crossroads already existed before you and yeah it's called roll the dice so it works for me it was called roll the dice and at the time they were trying that's the thing I had a lot of the mental hey I know the psychology I was raised in the business so I had the stuff that people get later ingrained in me but the stuff that most people get early like a physicality to being in great shape a good move set I [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=7983.16s)]
*  hate that term but hey do some cool moves yeah that stuff was I didn't have any of that so WWE was backwards and how they hey there's try this so I remember Jamie Noble gave me crossroads try this it was always you know you got a match tonight six minutes as you win it's always like moving really quick and you've got to keep up with it but then I also have like the Mega Man rule if I wrestled you like 50 times I'm gonna use some of your stuff out of respect for yourself oh okay that was the other thing what is the etiquette with that like can you break [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8013.16s)]
*  breaking all etiquette somebody eventually be like hey dude please stop are they are they annoyed like so you're wrestling guy who has a signature powerbomb whatever do you do it within the first few minutes do you tell them you're gonna oh no you got to put it if you're really gonna do it you got to put it in the greatest of spots you've got to respect what's your what's your thieving here I'll give you the most old-school respect earned you know firm don't mess with wrestler in the current locker room is Randy Orton yeah I do what's [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8043.16s)]
*  a Cody cutter which is like yeah you do it often but it's an RKO yeah never flinched he was he was my mentor when we were in the group legacy he watched me grow we always stayed in contact I asked him about it I think that's a big part asking about it you see all these other cutters there's one in NXT that's amazing and I wonder it may not be the same experience for you you might get the old hey that's my thing that's my thing I have feel I feel like I've peppered [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8073.16s)]
*  it in and layered it in a way that it's it's done it's done with love again I'm a gold dust uppercut it's my brother fair game I can have that bionic elbow it's my father fair game I can have that Bob Holly Alabama slam he was my first tag partner and I kind of de facto retired him from WWE I can take that it's the Mega Man you know you beat the boss and you get these certain things little things Roman hit me with a crossroads at WrestleMania 40 you know it's yeah all Austin and Rock did was just each other stuff to the you know [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8103.16s)]
*  yeah there's a charm in that we've gotten away from it because you can get a little overkill with it but you know yeah when you talked about the technicality the moves I remember in terms of emotional attachment the Rock would just do his elbow when he does so much flair that it became a finisher and they called it the people's elbow which is so funny but it's exactly what you the Stone Cold Center is not like a technically insane move it's just this and this but I'm so attached to you exactly that I fucking love that the trick with the people's elbows in the time too you have to remember you got an audience sitting [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8133.16s)]
*  there they want to take the ride if you're moving so fast they can't catch up he's gonna make you take we're gonna have a whole milk this shit we're gonna look at one another I'm gonna throw you my elbow pad I'm gonna hit both ropes yeah I only need to hit one and you're gonna every step of the way be there that's just genius and I think that's something that actually happened for him on the fly yeah as he was growing like oh they're they're biting on this this will stay yeah how do you how do you work the how do you learn [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8163.16s)]
*  to work the crowd like an instrument it seems like the people who are really good at this business can it's energy in energy out right energy out they are working that audience I think you have to always remember your audience is really sophisticated some people think they'll think like and not saying monster trucks audience are not sophisticated but they they again they don't think of it highbrow so the first thing you need to know is your audience is not an idiot the second thing that I have noticed is you [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8193.16s)]
*  have to really look at them so I can always tell a young and like green I guess or naive baby face looking out is if they go out and they're doing this and they're slapping hands that aren't there you know what I'm saying they're thinking I'm supposed to do that I'm doing and then you can see they're nervous so all those things totally understandable but you know look at that kid yeah look at this actually make the hey you're in this with me we're doing this together we're doing this together and it's the same when you're in [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8223.16s)]
*  the ring when you're in the ring you have to really make it clear like you're it we're in this together if I'm hurting you're hurting with me if I'm up I want you up now now's the time I'm making this comeback I want you to get your feet so it's a matter of not performing in what I would call darkness you were performing in front of thousands if not thousands you're performing in front of hundreds and if you can do it for hundreds you can do it in front of thousands get them involved nothing like an independent that's house lit where you can see everything including the concession stand [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8253.16s)]
*  and you know getting them to do something when most people are self-conscious about like do I cheer do I do it you know like there's no there's no drink minimum at this thing like they're coming in cold you know so that's that's the thing you have to really look at him that's something that has worked for me that I got from my brother is this is not for the cameras as much as this is for everybody in this place really cheap seat I've been able to do this thing lately nobody stopped me hopefully nobody stops me I always at the beginning of an interview will say hey we [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8283.16s)]
*  got a lot of people in here if you're up there say hi to the people down here if you're down here say hi to the people up there like let them know I am not doing this just for the camera yeah it's not it's not covert wrestling this is for us here tonight we have a very good time or on those nights like it might be a bad time too but you know I need I need you to feel something when you leave here in the heat of the the the battle right the dance how much is communicated because there are certain things they're like yeah I'm gonna reverse this and then you're gonna do this that can't just [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8313.16s)]
*  be improved on the fly so yeah so there has to be some choreography right again very uh behind the scenes so the sorry my bad so the what I do wrong there no you're fine amongst the battle no the dance because like if you're a killer dancer and I stand up and I take your hand and I put my hand on your waist and you're a killer dancer I don't have to discuss [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8343.16s)]
*  much with you yeah if I can move I can move you I know also what you do if you've been at this long enough it's important that I know what my opponent does he knows what I do when you are really young and and or if you're wrestling someone that might be more of an A to Z this is it this is next this is that but something in our business that's lost and it's really hard to pick up those who are good at it there's a lot of communication in there that no one ever sees I don't see [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8373.16s)]
*  like do you speak carny at all do you know about carny no no what's this so carny is how I talk almost in general you know how snoop talks for shizzle yeah carny to that like that when snoop started doing that I thought like does he know wrestling because that's a thing that's a lost art in wrestling what's carny carny is how you communicate like uh Dizuck you know exactly it's these little things that can be can be pointed out as perhaps trash talk you know Jim Ross always on commentary he's talking a lot of trash in there it's probably [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8403.16s)]
*  somebody explaining where we need to go what we need to do but the masters at it are just you don't know that how they do the trick you know whether it's hair in the face whether it's through the referee whether it's physical again you know I forgive me for giving some of industry secrets away but if ever this this means a bazillion things this means a bazillion things like if you get the Iggy I mean it might mean I'm okay that might mean reverse this is the Iggy that's the Iggy yeah the Iggy so the Iggy also is interchangeable though [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8433.16s)]
*  so you got to really know what's going on otherwise you like you know if a big table bump or whatever and you you got to know what it means in context everything's in context are you have that has ever somebody ever said something to you that like genuinely made you laugh but like in a serious moment and you had to like hold it together on screen yeah oh it happens all the time like what like uh there's a really famous uh moment where kofi kingston who was not jamaican he was from boston [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8463.16s)]
*  they knew it was hard for him like he's doing this jamaican character the accent they knew it was hard so they gave him this out where they were going to be like hey he was going to say like listen guys i'm not jamaican i'm from boston because i think we're we're all part of one team and Triple H was leading this promo but they have this moment where i'm just behind him and you can see i'm really struggling really struggling to keep it in um because years of him doing every appearance do you have it yeah like [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8493.16s)]
*  yeah kofi kingston yeah it was a hell of a moment there for sure jamaican jamaican me crazy was the whole yeah but people bring it up whatever whenever i'm just kind of leering around the back just trying my hardest but i think i i think i'd blow a whole promo line because i'm caught in the moment of what we're doing but it's people think like oh they can't laugh or they can't break character if you're out there with another good guy you can do whatever the hell you want you know what i'm saying like you can like [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8523.16s)]
*  we're friends we're you know like it's okay to have these moments but it happens a lot sammy zane's probably the easiest to do it to people wait why sammy zane when he was part of the bloodline and get on the same page because if we don't it's going to be bad news for all of us i mean any questions i got a question matter of fact i got a problem aren't you supposed to be jamaican what happened to your accent [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8553.16s)]
*  i think i'm supposed to chime in and i'm completely oh my god it's happening because i was on appearances with kofi where he'd be like ah see it eventually like he was trying to do it and you could tell he's like this is this is brutal but sammy zane is the most famous with bloodline stuff because he could make those guys laugh like jimmy and jay and even roman he could make them laugh what would he do well at the time he was part of the what was sammy's name the uh honorary oose he was not he's not a smohan he's not part of the bloodline but they made him part of the group [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8583.16s)]
*  and he committed fully to talking like yeah here's this you know white kid from montreal montreal you know wildling he's yeah he's not a samoan and the way he'd be like that's right and you could just see they were it was real it went from being this funny backstage bit to no they they ran with it it became a whole tv he really loved it and loved them which is why it hurts so bad when roman turns on him like it's hard it hurts yeah because he really did love this interaction but sammy can pop a lot of people all the usos can pop a lot of people [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8613.16s)]
*  too so there's an infamous moment where i couldn't keep it together um at a press conference because of jay so uh i i it's it would be widely considered the most unprofessional moment of my career wait wait i'm sorry is this the bloodline moment sammy yeah sam sammy's right there yeah i want to get back to this with this is that thing he's just not himself right now that's it okay he's just not lately he just hasn't been very oosey yeah jimmy's back there he's [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8643.16s)]
*  so [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8673.16s)]
*  honorary oose man so sammy's trying to crack him up he likes it but it's it's also like he's character [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8687.64s)]
*  appropriate again the meryl streep thing sammy's the type that he's going in on this yeah honorary i [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8695.4s)]
*  mean there was a picture of all of them from high school because they all grew up together and somebody [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8700.2s)]
*  just photoshopped sammy into it and like as a high schooler clearly not a member of the family clearly [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8703.800000000001s)]
*  yeah he was really good at it yeah my most unprofessional is the press conference [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8709.640000000001s)]
*  there might have been other factors involved with the press conference wait why what do you [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8713.960000000001s)]

*  so different than how it used to be i thought okay not our best look we obviously didn't say [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8833.4s)]
*  anything stupid and jay is the sweetest and like we didn't know we had the press conference i didn't [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8838.84s)]

*  if there's some trouble but instead they just decided to put the whole thing up on youtube the [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8847.96s)]
*  next day because they're like this is great you know and i thought oh i'm glad i won't do it again [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8852.68s)]
*  people people really want him and i i thought about it several times when we do these pressers to [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8857.96s)]
*  maybe crash jay's press conference just to bring it back because it was like a nice weekend update [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8862.2s)]
*  vibe to it so yeah but it's a great moment that was in between wrestlemania 39 and wrestlemania [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8866.52s)]
*  yeah it seems recent yeah yeah that's a big part of the resurgence right like um treating it like [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8871.880000000001s)]
*  sports teams like you do the post yeah the post conference you do the walk-ins yeah [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8879.320000000002s)]
*  like from espn it came in and man just the way he looks at and produces television very much [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8883.720000000001s)]
*  i love that because i grew up always wanting we're trying to emulate sports and we're trying to so i [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8890.68s)]
*  love that he brings that immersion from the sports world he's been a really terrific asset for wdb [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8896.12s)]
*  nick khan feels the same way and and again these ples after this is a real moment the questions [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8901.960000000001s)]
*  that come they're not always you know the safest questions it's they can't be the safest these are [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8907.880000000001s)]
*  real press conferences so it's it's a it's a very different company from the one that i left [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8912.6s)]
*  initially it's a really cool cool environment yeah i have a couple random wrestling questions [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8917.08s)]
*  hit it biggest pop you ever heard about that you were a part of or that you saw biggest pop i ever [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8921.88s)]
*  heard gosh that is a i really want to nail it and narrow it down to you know what it might be [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8927.16s)]
*  the rumble provides some of the biggest pops ever the royal rumble because the surprises returns [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8937.0s)]
*  and i have been around some of the the biggest pops so i'm gonna kind of put this between two [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8943.08s)]
*  and maybe it was just how i heard it in the arena in the moment but they were two that drove me [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8948.039999999999s)]
*  crazy one was my brother coming back to fight me at the royal rumble which we had not had that [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8952.76s)]
*  interaction and this was i had a mustache at the time uh doing a whole nother level of [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8958.039999999999s)]
*  character stuff with wdb trying to make it work uh and uh not a character at all think about it [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8963.8s)]
*  yeah well it wasn't real to me so it wasn't near on the level that yours is i can't grow [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8969.64s)]
*  face facial hair that well so what i did to compensate is i colored it you colored it so [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8973.64s)]
*  it was like it literally was a airport test head scratcher like look like makeup that was an [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8979.0s)]
*  amazing moment three years for that yeah it took a lot that took a long time shawn michael showing [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8985.88s)]
*  up to fight randy ordan and i remember he was in all camo and he like parted the seas that was an [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8990.68s)]
*  amazing pop i remember hearing i think the greatest pop in all of wrestling maybe uh [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=8996.12s)]
*  wrestlemania 40 was definitely up there but wrestlemania 18 rock hogan when hogan hits the [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9002.12s)]
*  leg drop and rock kicks out it is everything you could possibly want about our business in terms [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9009.720000000001s)]
*  of moves do they match the moments do the moves matter and that again it's not even always it [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9016.92s)]
*  has to be a stadium because sometimes a stadium the sound goes straight up yeah you don't know [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9023.08s)]
*  and then but it some of the smallest buildings ever i mean some significant moments the original [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9027.08s)]
*  all-in that's the one for me that i'll never forget the original all-in wrestling a guy named [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9032.6s)]
*  nick aldis who's now the general manager of smackdown before we locked up there was such a [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9037.56s)]
*  feeling about what had happened that weekend and how we had done this that the place is shaking [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9043.32s)]
*  and i remember they went around the barricade because they could see everybody oh my gosh you've [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9048.68s)]
*  got me now i'm on a rant here we go here's my final answer on the greatest pop aj styles and [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9052.28s)]
*  leon france just recently we do old school intros i'm champion at this point wrestling aj styles [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9057.400000000001s)]

*  situation you possibly imagine you can see on his face we knew we were in some sort of special [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9070.76s)]
*  moment because that crowd is currently the top crowd in all of wrestling i mean every crowd's [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9077.32s)]
*  been amazing but leon sound wise it sounded like they were going to bring the building down [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9082.119999999999s)]
*  unbelievable that's my favorite one i was ever in the ring for wow yeah that's awesome yeah you [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9088.039999999999s)]

*  such a cool moment such a cool moment i'm curious you had mentioned that like not necessarily dashing [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9098.199999999999s)]
*  cody rhodes era but on the way up that you plateaued when you had to actually switch to [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9103.88s)]
*  stardust yeah what is that plateau why does that character plateau and then what is the difference [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9110.199999999999s)]
*  when cody rhodes comes back what is the difference with that character and the initial character so [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9114.92s)]
*  sometimes i think it's as easy as physical like your physicality so this is going to sound silly [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9118.92s)]
*  but this is a vanity business there's still that you still have to if you're robust for example then [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9123.8s)]
*  what do you do to subvert the expectations how do you use that to your advantage like my father was [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9129.88s)]

*  importantly i should have fought the little battles hey i don't want to team with my brother today hey [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9218.359999999999s)]

*  really long time the rock is in his 50s probably this point still wrestling undertaker was wrestling [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9338.68s)]
*  forever still getting in the ring john cena i see him running down the ring as a 40-year-old man i'm [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9343.24s)]
*  like for your knees just that sprint the sprint yeah just sprinting down the ring or you got too [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9348.36s)]
*  many muscles for those knees dude what are you doing yeah what is it that keeps them doing it [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9351.32s)]
*  how do they do it why do they do it i mean if you look at rustlemania 40 when his music hits [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9355.720000000001s)]
*  that's the why that's the why there that that could you hear that and that's for you [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9360.68s)]
*  you could probably jump through the ceiling but what is the move where he puts on his shoulders [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9365.32s)]
*  and it helps attitude adjustment the attitude adjustment yeah yeah his hat kind of goes off [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9369.4s)]
*  almost crooked and he takes it and he fucking chucks oh yeah dude he is on fire no no that's [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9374.52s)]
*  the people he's a he's a fed by the people type wrestler in terms of that energy but to be [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9380.52s)]
*  smart he realizes he might be balding and he's like oh let me just adjust all this shit right [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9385.64s)]
*  just like a bag i forget who i think one of the guys austin theory might have come after the [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9389.32s)]
*  the balding and john's reply i don't know exactly what it was but i remember john had like [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9394.199999999999s)]
*  just such a non-cell of it like yep great i'm i'm still gonna beat you you know like the way [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9399.56s)]
*  approached him no he's been fantastic yeah john john's special uh that i think though that's [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9406.199999999999s)]
*  misleading that pop can be misleading that pop can make you think you can do everything [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9411.4s)]
*  and you so so i the reason i say 45 is also selfish because my dad was an old man rustler [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9416.92s)]
*  he wrestled all the way i mean he was he wrestled with you probably 60 yeah when he had had his [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9423.72s)]
*  last match maybe even 65 like and i hated seeing that i knew people liked it i knew he was okay [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9429.48s)]
*  but i hated seeing him that way i wanted to remember him differently and in battlegrounds [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9437.0s)]
*  the match where he hits his last bionic elbow on uh dean ambrose on the floor john moxley [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9444.279999999999s)]
*  and what people don't know about that is the reason all of it took place on the floor is [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9449.88s)]
*  because he couldn't get up the steps that easily and i think at that point i that's like the hardest [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9453.24s)]
*  thing to see is you know he knew though i gotta call it like let me go guys let me go and that [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9460.119999999999s)]
*  was the last one of the last big things he did with me on on screen but it was a really great [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9467.0s)]
*  gift but i because of that i don't ever want to ever want to overstay my welcome i've really [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9471.56s)]
*  enjoyed uh being you know i had the management role with my previous company i i would say i [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9476.76s)]
*  failed at that i didn't necessarily succeed but i i learned a lot from that failure and with this [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9482.04s)]
*  company with ww if that's something that comes up for me would you like to be behind the scenes [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9487.960000000001s)]
*  it's definitely something i'm considering um because i had a whole run at it once before where [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9492.52s)]
*  i pretty much bombed so at this point i know like you know what i think i can get this now i think [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9496.68s)]
*  i can figure it out long way off though long way off i want to hang on to the two uh to this as [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9501.240000000002s)]
*  long as i can i just want to ask one more thing yeah the story and ending the stories ultimately [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9506.52s)]
*  you getting the belt yeah and bringing it to your father so that no one could ever take it away [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9511.56s)]
*  that's right did you and your mom and your brother and the rest of the immediate family ever have a [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9516.199999999999s)]
*  moment where you kind of honored your dad with the belt because he couldn't be there [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9521.64s)]
*  the it's it's right there in the ring after us mania 40 the only uh i remember when rock was [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9526.119999999999s)]
*  like going in on mama roads and he thought it was really funny and i remember thinking she doesn't [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9532.039999999999s)]
*  watch like you think she watches she know her dad was i mean her father her husband was dusty roads [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9538.92s)]

*  it's real yeah a little you know what i'm saying and and when that moment was happening he's [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9553.64s)]
*  yelling at her and all that i actually had this whole epiphany of like i could have had rick flair [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9557.88s)]
*  who was my dad's greatest rival with me i could have had arn anderson who was my manager previously [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9562.84s)]
*  i could have had my brother i could have had one of these people who was really like dad and knew [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9568.36s)]
*  enough about dad that i could share with them i realized in that moment no one was more qualified [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9573.960000000001s)]
*  than her nobody um sorry but uh in the ring i got to hand it to her and that was just the best it [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9578.36s)]
*  really it really was the best because when you're a wrestler's wife oh my god a wrestler's kid like [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9588.92s)]

*  with it and hung with it and uh she knew the story wasn't so much about handing it to him anymore just [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9615.56s)]
*  about us having it like nah he's you keep saying his name he trained this guy trained that guy [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9620.84s)]

*  how can it be felt in the biggest way and his youngest son winning the hardest title to win in [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xvx77i23c&t=9632.12s)]
