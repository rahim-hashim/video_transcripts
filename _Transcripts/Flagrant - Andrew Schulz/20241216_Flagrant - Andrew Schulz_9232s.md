*  So he did the corporate way of trying to keep you down. Oh, it's not me. It's now it's them and then [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=718.0s)]
*  When M says he's not gonna do it if I don't if I'm not dead, let's go that yeah [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=723.88s)]
*  What's your and Jay's issue? It's just competitive stuff. It's really just this is what I'm saying when it gets past [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  Actual art but actual music and you trying to block something this in business then it feels weird [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=736.84s)]
*  It feels like we should be having beef. Mmm. Oh [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=743.08s)]
*  Okay, so that's the behind-the-scenes thing that we don't see it's one thing when there's like people talking about each other in music [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=747.0s)]
*  Yeah, but there's behind-the-scenes business deals that a guy is getting involved when on the side and it's not like you're gonna go public [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=752.7800000000001s)]
*  And be like they tried to stop my vitamin water. Oh this deal and you go [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=758.6s)]
*  He said that to you like [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=763.24s)]
*  Don't speak to your temperament like say, you know, 50s look crazy. He'll say anything you see what saying anything did to target [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  So they're trying he's basically trying to scare people out of the deal [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=773.84s)]
*  Interesting and then M shut it down and he was like, you know, he's not coming. I'm not coming and then [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  thing cuz [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=783.72s)]
*  He really is the biggest. Yeah, like, you know, they can say what they want. Yeah, but we go to the stats [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=784.98s)]
*  The numbers don't lie [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=791.12s)]
*  The bots and all that shit there's a there's a you know, M obviously speaks with you with high praise [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=794.48s)]
*  But there's a there's a few videos that I see and everybody talks about funny [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=799.6s)]
*  You are they talk about obviously the album is all the success but like Eminem specifically talks about your rapping skill a lot [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=803.2s)]
*  Is that mean a lot? I'm like it does [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=810.68s)]
*  He never left [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=814.08s)]
*  that part of [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=816.2s)]
*  The creativity okay would go back when you don't see him he's back he's in his regimen of the studio [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=817.92s)]
*  Yeah, and this is why like he kind of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=824.08s)]
*  That they can't you can be as good as him, but you can't really beat him at that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=827.72s)]
*  Because you have to put all your energy there and you're just not gonna do it once these guys get famous [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=832.2s)]
*  They leave the they leave the city and they go and the thing that makes him feel good is he? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=836.56s)]
*  Joe you heard what I did last [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=840.48s)]
*  And [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  Gives him that again. So if that's really what's driving you it's really tough to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=844.08s)]
*  To be better than and some of them may have a gift [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=849.2s)]
*  And maybe it may be a God-given talent that they can rap the way we speak but they don't work as hard as it [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=852.72s)]
*  It's like Kobe Bryant. Yep is was outperforming people because he would work harder [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=859.4s)]
*  Yeah, conditioning himself to do it and other than and mounting the bodies who's the most talented rapper you've seen? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=864.44s)]
*  Period just talent natural born this well [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=871.48s)]
*  maybe Craig G [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=875.6s)]
*  Like when the artist can freestyle like without thinking about anything and it just all falls in line and say sometimes they can [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=877.2s)]
*  End up rapping so it's so easy for them that they don't know exactly what to rap about [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=884.08s)]
*  Even eminem because I remember those freestyles where they would just give him a word and just go [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=892.08s)]
*  Oh [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=896.54s)]
*  Sometimes you miss like the connectivity with the music like their songs [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=899.3s)]
*  There's comedy where it might not even be like the most perfect joke, but it makes you feel [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=904.18s)]
*  To you that it connects [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=911.3399999999999s)]
*  And a lot of times if there's no truth to it, it's not funny [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=913.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it has to have some sort of connection is grounded in truth [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=917.5s)]
*  But it's almost a war perspective being offered by the comedian [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=921.62s)]
*  The timing the way it comes in I look at it I'm like yo [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=925.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. Like, you know, you see things like the the the white party be there and then they have a little baby like in [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=929.98s)]
*  a sandwich [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=936.58s)]
*  Pictures at the white party though, what is that? I don't know every picture is a little bit so happy to be there [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=948.5s)]
*  I'm like this regular parties people don't just hug each other. I think four hours of traffic [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=954.82s)]
*  That's crazy, I'm telling you was that fun crazy. It was a little too much. That's just white boy shit [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=967.26s)]
*  That's why it's the white party [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=972.26s)]
*  The whitest party [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=974.54s)]
*  What is going on in the one in the right that is insanity [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=979.78s)]
*  He looks like he's unzipping his pants [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=984.74s)]

*  It's just harder to connect. It is harder to do it that way from my perspective [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2609.48s)]
*  Yeah, quick question about the nausea thing [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2612.6s)]
*  He knew you were gonna do that track and still didn't call you or maybe he just didn't I don't think it [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2614.2s)]
*  It was aware of it, but they did that right right right in his behalf [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2618.2799999999997s)]
*  You know i'm saying they said no [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2622.68s)]
*  No, I know they did that and then shifted for him to rap on the record and then when that happens and i'm like damn [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2623.96s)]
*  Why you didn't call me to just say? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2629.08s)]
*  That it was that it i'm not on the record that he's on the record [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2631.64s)]
*  Yeah, see cuz they that would do you think he knew that you were on the record already? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2634.92s)]
*  Because maybe he didn't know I think that he yeah [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2638.68s)]
*  Oh, he took him off the record. Yeah, okay. All right guys. We'll take a break for a second [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2641.8s)]
*  Listen, we gotta talk about how the nfl is trying to trying to steal christmas. Yeah, I love it dude [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2645.64s)]
*  They are really grinching it up. Yeah, they're trying to steal christmas from mba mba always had christmas lock down [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2650.68s)]
*  That was their day. That was their day. Yeah, and the nfl is like nah 50 cent with alex. That's my corner now [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2655.7999999999997s)]
*  They really try to take that corner. Yeah, so we got a couple games good games. I think you like these [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  I think good games stealers choose chiefs the chiefs every fucking game [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2667.7999999999997s)]
*  They play is close and the steelers are good [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2672.04s)]
*  So the steelers could win I guess you still bet on the chiefs just because they keep winning [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2674.04s)]
*  Yeah, but uh, I don't know what the spread is but ravens texans. I don't trust the texans [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2677.24s)]
*  I hate to say that as someone from texas, but I just don't trust them this year [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2682.44s)]
*  So you think ravens got it? I think the ravens got it. They haven't been amazing this year [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2686.6s)]
*  But I trust them more than I trust bro going back to the steelers real quick tomlin is so funny [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2689.7999999999997s)]

*  One of my favorite things about the mic'd up situations. Yeah [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2697.56s)]
*  Is when a player is acting different than normal and the other players realize he's mic'd up [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2701.24s)]
*  So he'll be like in the locker room be like, all right guys, let's go and they'll be like, oh you mic'd up [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2707.08s)]

*  Okay, so there you go [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2757.2400000000002s)]
*  Cool. Yeah, that's fire. But also like [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2759.6400000000003s)]
*  You already got the game in a bag [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2762.52s)]
*  Your job is incredibly dangerous. Yeah [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2765.0s)]
*  Why go out there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2768.84s)]
*  Fuck the single game record. You could go over to season also saquon hasn't been this healthy in years normally [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2772.2000000000003s)]
*  He gets hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hate the eagles. Yeah, you want to go get hit in the head [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2777.48s)]
*  You're like, I'll just sit on the bench [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2781.48s)]
*  The young guys [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2783.48s)]
*  Okay, so when and then uh, and then the ravens you think uh got it I think the ravens got it [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2788.04s)]
*  I think they'll figure it out, dude [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2792.2s)]
*  Is there a storyline you like this year in football? Is there something you find really detroit and buffalo interesting? Yeah [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2793.88s)]
*  I think those are it's like [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2799.64s)]
*  We finally could see one of these cities win a super bowl and I think that would be so like a fun redemption story [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2801.72s)]
*  Yeah, man buffalo the most loyal fans [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2808.04s)]
*  Yeah, detroit been getting shit on for decades and every every possible way [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2810.52s)]
*  Yeah, and if either one of them got a super bowl, it would be so sick. So i'm hoping that happens [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2814.44s)]
*  Yeah, detroit's already been detroit's never been I just mean it's a city the city is just [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2819.8s)]
*  L after l honestly and detroit's a good city ever go to detroit. Yeah, that's cool. It's a cool city [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2824.76s)]
*  It's actually coming up a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a good it's yeah [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2829.4s)]
*  But uh, I think that would those are the storylines. I'm most interested in russell wilson's like kind of back [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2832.92s)]
*  He's like kind of playing well, we thought he was cooked cooked. Yeah, what do you think changed there? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2837.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I think penceburg has a good enough supporting cast [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2841.72s)]
*  So that he doesn't really matter. He just needs to be serviceable and he's been managing that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2845.0s)]
*  Yeah, but also denver a lot of people were saying sean payton who coached russell wilson last year [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2849.08s)]
*  He was the problem, but now they're kind of winning with the rookie quarterback [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2853.16s)]
*  So like he's kind of redeemed himself a little bit [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2856.52s)]
*  So there's a lot of redemption going on for everybody except the cowboys, which is cool [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2858.84s)]
*  Um [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2862.12s)]
*  Well, how about your chiefs though using the dark magic to to always win [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2863.72s)]
*  The chiefs look very vulnerable this year, even though they're 11 and one. I know that sounds crazy. Maybe 12 and one whatever they are [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2867.0s)]
*  12 and one sounds crazy, but they are I think 10 straight one score games [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2872.6s)]
*  They've won and at some point you would think that has to give I know they got [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=2877.16s)]

*  I have faith in I just use [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3641.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm assuming there will be consequences [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3646.7799999999997s)]
*  Actions that this brother is talking about [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3650.14s)]
*  Why is that a part of his thought process today while we're here having a good time [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3654.22s)]
*  That's a good you do have people who really [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3659.1s)]
*  Look when you break up with them, they don't care about you anymore. Yeah [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3662.7s)]
*  So they'll say things and you go. Yeah, but it doesn't hold merit doesn't have any connect. No real [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3665.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course after all this years and you don't see nothing. Yeah, like the girl did she's upset with you [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3670.7s)]
*  She's just angry with you. She got yeah and you go [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3674.7s)]
*  I thought I thought the smartest thing jay said in in the statement was uh, if if you really believe this happened to press criminal charges [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3678.3799999999997s)]
*  He said pull up but I don't think that was [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3685.58s)]
*  Tell me tell me. Okay. Look [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3688.3799999999997s)]
*  Because of the statute limitation is oh there is no criminal [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3690.94s)]
*  So it's a so making a statement is to make people feel like but apparently if she's under 18 [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3694.62s)]
*  Didn't you say it still could be criminal? He knows he's fed [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3698.8599999999997s)]
*  He used to be a cop [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3702.62s)]
*  Into a cop he was a sell drugs became a police officer. Did you know that? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3704.62s)]
*  You know what he would do when they would arrest g-unit guys he would be like [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3711.98s)]
*  Bitch [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3718.3799999999997s)]
*  That's extra fucking cheese sandwiches [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3723.74s)]
*  Hey, you know, I don't know man, I think what's the name [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3730.46s)]
*  I get confused too [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3734.3799999999997s)]
*  When you look at this shit, it's a lot. It's a lot of confusing information, right? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3736.06s)]
*  But I think when you do point out that why didn't you file criminal cases? Because you can't you can't it's over 20 years old [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3739.2599999999998s)]
*  This was 2000 bro, but I think if it's I think if it's a money this is happening [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3747.34s)]
*  I'm not even 50 cent yet [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3751.58s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow, you see what i'm saying? Like this is that that that's that far back. Yeah. Yeah, so it's like i'm not [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3753.42s)]
*  It didn't even take place at that point. So i'm like [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3759.7400000000002s)]
*  Yo, can I this is [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3763.1s)]
*  I want to get back to can I ask you a question? How did you convince? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3764.94s)]
*  Louisiana to change the laws [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3768.36s)]
*  No, it was your influence is a little scary sometimes bro [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3770.62s)]
*  Like you play around on the internet, but then like [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3773.58s)]
*  You made a state change of law. Have you been to shreveport? They need it [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3776.94s)]
*  No, yes, but I spent half my childhood basically in shreveport [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3781.02s)]
*  So I know they need everything you can give them. Can you explain what happened? Because [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3784.7799999999997s)]
*  This was crazy. Yeah shreveport. They were first to provide tax incentives [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3789.18s)]
*  and they um, they blossomed first and then their political [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3793.9s)]
*  Stuff to go on out there had them pull it and a lot of people [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3798.38s)]
*  Gravitated to a lamp and closer places that they can work consistently in the field that they were working in [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3802.06s)]
*  So now when you get a chance to come out there like I didn't have [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3807.58s)]
*  It was millennium studios originally I worked on streets of blood out there [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3811.18s)]
*  I filmed with val kilmer and sharon stone and so I had an experience in shreveport as just acting talent [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3815.18s)]
*  at that point and then um [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3820.46s)]
*  Avi learner had on the studio at that point and avi he just financed the expendables [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3822.22s)]
*  I did the expenditures with stalone. Uh jay said them and [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3827.42s)]
*  Uh megan fox dolph london [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3830.7s)]
*  All squad that's the one that like all my action stars are in it. I like action as a genre [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3833.58s)]
*  So I did that movie, but while i'm there i'm asking him like what was wrong with he was like nothing [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3838.06s)]
*  It's just the incentive on the way [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3842.7s)]
*  So we were filming in bulgaria because they understand that they need to bring [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3845.18s)]
*  the productions out there and then [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3849.58s)]
*  And just real quick for everybody that's watching is that sometimes states will actually reduce the taxes on a production [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3851.82s)]
*  It could be a tv show or a film and that will incentivize people to do it and their incentive hollywood or their incentive new york [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3857.9s)]
*  A lot of times they shoot toronto instead of new york city actually how you went in new york are the worst places to shoot [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3863.9s)]
*  It's too expensive. Yeah, yeah [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3868.94s)]
*  It's the worst place to shoot and it's turned into that because it's become such a frequent thing [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3870.3s)]
*  And then now everybody's moving to different areas to create businesses that are functional [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3875.6600000000003s)]
*  So you do you go by this huge film complex in shreveport? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3881.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh throw a pretty sick comedy show in order to crack off super crack off they can't afford that show [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3886.48s)]
*  Everybody showed bro. It was everybody showed it was chapelle cat [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3896.0s)]
*  Uh andrew schultz i'll be wherever [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3902.3999999999996s)]
*  Put my boys up in the room that's what i'm saying [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3907.2799999999997s)]
*  Bill bellamy was there like it was gary oh it was like dc was there [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3910.48s)]
*  It was crazy. It was it was [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3916.24s)]
*  And it was not I mean backstage was there was 2 000 people backstage [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3918.7999999999997s)]
*  It was definitely like now you are an industry guy [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3923.9199999999996s)]
*  There was no pressure for them to do like long sets just being is enough [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3927.68s)]
*  Like they didn't have to that's fine, you know, and then [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3932.0s)]
*  Now but giving that to the city was very cool [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3935.2799999999997s)]
*  You blow it up and you're there and and there's these tax incentives for the state [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3937.6s)]
*  And then it comes out I think with the new administration they're getting rid of the taxes again [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3942.4s)]
*  So i'm like, ah, I go what the fuck. Yeah, you gotta imagine what that feels like after you just spent five [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3946.32s)]
*  What [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3954.0s)]
*  So what i'm trying to understand is what happened because a week later [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3956.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we went I went the state said [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3960.32s)]
*  We actually would like to bring back the tax incentives. Yeah, it's what it was up, but they had to go to pass to [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3962.96s)]
*  Different areas of government so they had but it was questioning it went from they reduced it from 150 million dollars to 125 million [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3969.3599999999997s)]
*  but it's still [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3977.8399999999997s)]
*  Now it's functional still the right place for me to film so i'll be able to [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3979.2799999999997s)]
*  Do some things and I had bought I bought a lot of property out there. I thought the whole waterfront or whatever [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3982.64s)]
*  Like downtown because because I got revitalizing and get it up to [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3988.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, like the hotel rooms was a little off. Yeah [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3993.3599999999997s)]
*  I gotta make sure the experience is like what i'm putting on my performance [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=3999.2s)]
*  But you know what's interesting about this is like [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4004.56s)]
*  It that's that this is what all the people who buy uh sports teams are doing now like what you're doing [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4007.04s)]
*  With entertainment is what golden state warriors did they basically get the city to pay for the new arena [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4013.4399999999996s)]
*  The conglomerate the group people buy up all the real estate around that shitty ass place [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4020.56s)]
*  And they rented out to restaurants they make condos there [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4025.76s)]
*  So much traffic they make more money off the real estate than they do off the team [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4029.44s)]
*  So knowing that you're going to build up this city and you're going to make it a hub for projects [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4033.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you got to get those places and revitalize and this is the only way that you can [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4037.28s)]
*  Assure that it'll be that the lights will turn on when you need them to like so for to actually [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4040.6400000000003s)]
*  Have places to go out to eat and do things that you [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4045.76s)]
*  Enjoy out there because that's that's the basic experience [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4048.88s)]

*  The fear that everybody there lives in they're they're terrified at every second [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4670.8s)]
*  They're like yeah part of it too is like the certain things i'm not gonna compromise right you look and go [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4675.6s)]
*  That's the old hollywood. We told them while it was like [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4680.96s)]
*  And it was different too. You wouldn't dare say something about sexuality [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4683.92s)]

*  Got him to see peep by my own [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4712.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, so so you find a way to [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4715.36s)]
*  Essentially operate as yourself in these spaces you have to hit a roadblock [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4717.84s)]
*  There has to be a time where you come across someone they're like, hey, can you just calm it down on social media? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4721.28s)]
*  Always get that. Okay. And then how do you handle that conversation? You know, I do look it was usually from stars [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4725.2s)]
*  I would get that energy from them like they would say you got their whole network on your back and they have the balls to come [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4731.04s)]
*  Yes, could you just calm it down a little? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4736.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, well, you know you're asking me to to not do what is why you even have success [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4739.36s)]
*  So they're so detached from yeah. Yeah, it was like I don't like oh, you know what? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4745.04s)]
*  Okay [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4748.879999999999s)]
*  Then when you don't see me put posting anything connected to them [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4749.5199999999995s)]
*  That's because now i'm like i got 41 shows across 10 different networks. God damn damn [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4752.24s)]
*  I wouldn't have been able to look god 19 of those shows they had to tell me no [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4757.28s)]
*  Who stars stars had to tell me? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4762.4s)]
*  For me to go out and sell it to another now. Wow [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4764.88s)]
*  So i'm the easiest person to say no to I don't care about [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4768.32s)]
*  Particularly someone else go by stars like i've dragged the most people to stars. Yeah [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4771.599999999999s)]
*  With the material that I created so now when they would like it to be other [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4777.04s)]
*  Projects like they would like it to be outlander [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4781.5199999999995s)]
*  Um [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4784.24s)]
*  If that works for the network and that audience is there hardcore for it is a bigger network. Yeah [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4785.2s)]
*  Like you know, I mean, so they wanted to be that so they promoted that all the time and i'm like, yo [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4791.6s)]
*  You forgot to say this [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4796.56s)]
*  And i'm like even though [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4799.84s)]
*  You know, I you know, there's different things you could did [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4802.56s)]
*  Just in entertainment period there's blocks. There's borders of things, right? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4806.4800000000005s)]
*  and I think when you um [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4811.2s)]
*  diversity it is they limit how often they'll [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4813.2s)]
*  Specifically take a time to point out that it's doing what yeah, you know, I mean because there's other spaces that [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4817.5s)]
*  That you know that it feels like they are pro that or yeah. Oh, that's interesting. They care more about [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4824.16s)]
*  Their identity being wrapped around outlander. Yes wrapped around your show, which are the most successful shows [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4832.32s)]
*  To create the actual [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4839.5199999999995s)]
*  The people are going to decide what your identity is when you're a tv network a tv network doesn't decide [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4844.96s)]
*  The people decide when you got a ceo there and he says this is the mandate premium women [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4850.48s)]
*  And you go [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4855.759999999999s)]
*  You know the shows that we just put up their work. Don't match a new mandate. Yeah, they don't get it [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4857.28s)]
*  It's yeah, and also they have an arrogance. They think that they're the ones that are making the show successful [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4862.799999999999s)]

*  Every month but they'll look at it and say premium women if you look the females are paying that bill [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4880.16s)]
*  You see what i'm saying in the house thinking about household, right? And then they go [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4887.28s)]
*  When you look and you see that data you go all premium woman [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4891.28s)]
*  So you want to create content that targets this demo and it's just a person that has [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4893.44s)]
*  Information is not paying attention to what they're actually right that means she's not watching the tv because you like the show [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4898.4s)]

*  Okay, I got you [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4915.04s)]
*  There's a yeah go go you've had some of the craziest business moves like vitamin water a bunch [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4916.88s)]
*  I can the list goes on but power was probably one of the flyest moves because [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4921.68s)]
*  First season and correct me if i'm wrong first season. I think you only were getting like 17k an episode [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4926.879999999999s)]
*  like he lowballed himself and then after the success then you [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4932.96s)]
*  renegotiated and now [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4939.12s)]
*  And now he has fucking just go to the nightclub just go no no no performance. Yeah, just i'm gonna be here [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4941.28s)]
*  Yeah, I got paid more to do that. I wanted to make the show so you bet on yourself like that shit is fire [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4947.599999999999s)]
*  And they go look they told me no we pitched to everybody ain't gotta know first [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4952.88s)]
*  I I came back I had time because I knew the storylines and everything. I I wrote music that matches [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4958.0s)]
*  The characters and stuff like that. So I said this we're gonna do when you pitch [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4963.92s)]
*  Portion of pitch then we'll press play [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4967.2s)]
*  And then portion of pitching they will press play and then we'll be able to have the room looking and going they had an experience [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4969.68s)]
*  They can steal it music from 50 cent at that point and then i'm going this is [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4975.04s)]
*  The place where they where they spend the less the least amount of money in the production [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4980.400000000001s)]
*  Because the last place they're doing is musical clearance [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4984.96s)]
*  The last thing they've already done all the special effects everything else. Everybody's already got paid [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4988.4800000000005s)]
*  So the music supervisor will come in after yeah thought yeah [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4992.4800000000005s)]
*  And they'll pull out the things that you put and place things that are comparable [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4996.16s)]
*  He changed that and now every show is putting like drake on [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=4999.52s)]
*  Also shout out you for the for clearing, uh, oh no, that was [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5004.64s)]
*  Song man for a special respect respect, but but okay [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5009.76s)]
*  So anyway, so you were able to bypass certain things [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5014.0s)]
*  But one thing you said to me when you were bossing is I was like, why do you think the shows are so successful? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5017.4400000000005s)]

*  But I was reading the scripts but they gave it to draw because they wrote it with intentions for it to be something [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5674.4s)]
*  Yeah, but jarod butler I had it because I looked for the best shit to find [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5679.28s)]
*  So I wasn't in the movie guys, so five years later i'm cool enough [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5685.76s)]

*  I am available. I'm at a point where it's a good time to pivot [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5702.5599999999995s)]
*  Like you look and go look right now you think [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5707.92s)]
*  Like in drake's case because because of the success he's feeling the backlash of his success [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5712.08s)]
*  Yes [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5716.88s)]
*  Right now everything that he said he did they they did in that lawsuit. They did it. What do you mean? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5718.08s)]
*  Like university music group reducing the price of the no everything that he did is a part of marketing. I feel that too [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5722.4800000000005s)]

*  Right because this they're looking at it like a business completely not personalizing each individual [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5744.24s)]
*  Play the record don't play it. They're just selling music. They don't care about it's not a personal relationship at all [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5751.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's like hershey's owns kitkat too. You'll feel personal because you feel like you made them so much money [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5757.28s)]
*  And no go no, it's not personal at all. Listen [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5763.36s)]
*  But drake's your man. How do you personally feel about him suing? I don't look [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5766.32s)]

*  All right. So and then there's a point where your voice becomes a hit [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5779.84s)]

*  I never knew [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5873.76s)]
*  If it for what I what I was thinking is forward and I understand it [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5875.2s)]

*  What the fuck [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5891.04s)]
*  Like this and you you were on fire just a week ago [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5893.12s)]
*  And now they're like did you did you think or something changed about you? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5897.2s)]
*  All right, so everybody when everybody's coming at you, right? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5901.04s)]
*  When you're on top you're on top of the world [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5903.76s)]
*  You feel the energy of all these people that don't have what you have right and even if they're not coming directly [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5905.52s)]
*  They're like saying indirect sneak shit. They're still like would like the idea of you not [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5911.6s)]
*  And they relish and then support the things that are against you [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5917.6s)]
*  They laugh at it. They regurgitate the the talking points of it to appear unaffected by things that [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5921.76s)]
*  Bother you will but they are from actually having to go through but they're affected by your success [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5928.8s)]
*  Because they think your success is stopping theirs, but people realize it's like they just suck [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5933.92s)]
*  It's gonna take time for that bullshit. You have to connect anyway [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5939.4400000000005s)]
*  Because they rather think that you're the one stopping them then they ain't shit [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5946.320000000001s)]
*  They ain't shit, no, no, you're in the way [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5952.16s)]
*  Blame something like you say [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5955.76s)]
*  Look, this is why they always say our artist's first album was his best album [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5959.2s)]
*  Because you don't get a second chance at a first impression that first impression [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5963.92s)]
*  Everyone was in a grience that this shit is cool and you had no expectation [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5967.4400000000005s)]
*  Right, so it's like low expectations keep organically you can put a record out [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5971.4400000000005s)]
*  Nobody knows who you are and it organically starts streaming it starts to work [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5974.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they go you always knew so you can do things during that period [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5977.4400000000005s)]
*  You can make a million mistakes on that first while you're going up the charts for the first time [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5980.96s)]
*  And then afterwards you have to figure out all of the mistakes that you made and not fuck up again [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5985.84s)]
*  Because you can't launch the project without having a marketing campaign set and and know exactly what the single is and when [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5990.32s)]
*  You're gonna have your targeted date for it to hit radio and everything else because [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=5998.48s)]
*  It's not gonna stream as they went [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6003.12s)]
*  They're not finding it for the first time. Yeah, so they'll go. Oh no, that's cool. But it's not like his first shit [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6005.5199999999995s)]
*  Is there anything you would have done differently music was? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6011.12s)]
*  No, I I think i'm gonna make the right decisions because I didn't [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6014.8s)]
*  I left before they told me to go [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6018.8s)]
*  And you know what usually [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6023.84s)]
*  The artist is the last one to know he fell off. Yeah, like you're not paying attention because they're not [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6026.08s)]
*  All right, you know how the fuck you know, so you could be there like yo I ain't doing a show and look [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6032.56s)]
*  No, because you still think you're supposed to get 80 000 [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6037.2s)]
*  And you don't bring the fucking number down and then you'll have shows moving around [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6040.08s)]
*  Sometimes you need to do a show for 17 grand and then you got 42 shows in production [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6044.32s)]
*  But they won't take that ego. Yeah, sometimes you got to pay the dope boys on the corner [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6048.72s)]
*  And just like and they're not exactly so you can show them with boston [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6052.88s)]
*  That's and then yeah, that's it's always been a part of it. Yeah, you get it [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHTwv56jZ7E&t=6057.12s)]
