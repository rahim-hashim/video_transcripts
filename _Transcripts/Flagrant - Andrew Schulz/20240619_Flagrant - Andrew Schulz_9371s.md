# Chael Sonnen Exposes WWE’s Vince McMahon, Conor McGregor’s Legacy, & Anderson Silva Revenge
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA)
*  I mean when Vince got me to down the business, I did think it was a surprise but as good as he is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=0.0s)]
*  I would not completely count that he couldn't come back when the men start coming out. It will be a different story [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4.64s)]
*  We used to bang dudes. Oh, yeah, but he would hold their careers over just like you would the women [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9.3s)]
*  It was the same thing you get paid more you get pushed more [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=14.58s)]
*  This is not a secret in the industry [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=16.5s)]
*  There is a lot of homosexuals that Vince came across but there was also straight guys [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=17.76s)]
*  It just wanted to push in the business where it like turned into prostitution. That was very well-known [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=21.8s)]
*  If you had a bang one dude, who would it be? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=26.88s)]
*  If you're Vince, who are you choosing? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to think of an anth- without sounding gay [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Go like, right in the stereo so you don't have to see his face [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  See, now that's a stud answer right there [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=36.88s)]
*  Connor needs a win to prove that he deserves another fight [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=39.68s)]
*  And he could sell and he could still be a top draw [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=42.72s)]
*  I don't know for how long without winning you could do that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=44.72s)]
*  But my point is I mean Connor really is fighting for a lot like possibly his career is on the line [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=46.96s)]
*  I'm sorry for the insensitivity we might have said with the word gay early [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=50.72s)]
*  I didn't see the fingernails coming [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=54.72s)]
*  That didn't- so- [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=56.72s)]
*  Who? Are you voting for a worm man? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=58.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=60.72s)]
*  For- I'm sorry, worm? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=62.72s)]
*  Is that Trump? No [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=64.72s)]
*  Who's worm man? Come on dude [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=66.72s)]
*  You don't know worm brains? No! [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=68.72s)]
*  I mean I assume you're talking about RFK because it's the only person we're not discussing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=70.72s)]
*  No, what's a worm brain? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=74.72s)]
*  He said a worm made part of his brain [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=76.72s)]
*  Oh my god! What happened there? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=78.72s)]
*  That was like a week ago! [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=80.72s)]
*  Why did he say that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=82.72s)]
*  I don't know, he was doing great [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=84.72s)]
*  Everybody's like there's a third option [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=86.72s)]
*  He was doing great! Why did he do that? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=88.72s)]
*  Because that wasn't to explain his voice [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=90.72s)]
*  I mean it had nothing to do with that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=92.72s)]
*  If he said a worm ate my voice box [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=94.72s)]
*  We'd be like oh that makes sense [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=96.72s)]
*  Poor guy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=98.72s)]
*  But it was literally at the pinnacle [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=100.72s)]
*  He's at the zenith of his popularity [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=102.72s)]
*  And nobody's supporting Trump or Biden [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=104.72s)]
*  And he comes up and he goes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=106.72s)]
*  By the way, a worm brain [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=108.72s)]
*  He comes up and he goes by the way [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=110.72s)]
*  A worm ate a piece of my brain [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=112.72s)]
*  If you look at his voice you'll see that it's something completely unrelated [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=114.72s)]
*  Did he run that back by the way? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=116.72s)]
*  What happened after the worm brain incident? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=118.72s)]
*  I think he's just kind of standing on it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=120.72s)]
*  Oh he is! No really, a worm has part of my brain [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=122.72s)]
*  Alright [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=124.72s)]
*  I think he said three arms eat my brain [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=126.72s)]
*  And I'd still be smarter than either of the candidates [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=128.72s)]
*  Which is a fairly good response but [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=130.72s)]
*  You've seen Men in Black [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=132.72s)]
*  He might be proof that politicians need to lie [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=134.72s)]
*  He's been really honest about everything [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=136.72s)]
*  He's like chill dog, it's too much [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=138.72s)]
*  He went on the house [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=140.72s)]
*  I can't remember why they had him in there but he testified something in front of the house [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=142.72s)]
*  And Nancy Pelosi [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=144.72s)]
*  They destroyed him [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=146.72s)]
*  It was honor of Joe Biden, Democrats will eat their own [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=148.72s)]
*  Republicans won't do that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=150.72s)]
*  But they destroyed that poor guy [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=152.72s)]
*  And a lot of it had to do with his beliefs on COVID [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=154.72s)]
*  Which turned out he was kind of ahead of the curve [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=156.72s)]
*  But it also had to do with the CIA [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=158.72s)]
*  And the assassination of his family members [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=160.72s)]
*  And I feel like that's a sensitive topic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=162.72s)]
*  To tell him he's wrong [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=164.72s)]
*  Yeah, can you blame him? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=166.72s)]
*  No, can you blame him? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=168.72s)]
*  How would you feel if your father and your uncle [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=170.72s)]
*  My goodness [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=172.72s)]
*  By the way, have you ever gone to Dallas, the place where Jay was shot? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=174.72s)]
*  If you stand there and you do that daily tour [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=176.72s)]
*  You just look around [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=178.72s)]
*  To the prison and the suppository [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=180.72s)]
*  And you go, it is a lie [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=182.72s)]
*  Lee Harvey Oswald did not do that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=184.72s)]
*  For sure he did not do that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=186.72s)]
*  At least not alone [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=188.72s)]
*  That shot from that window [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=190.72s)]
*  It's a good shot [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=192.72s)]
*  But the point is, why doesn't he take it when the car is coming straight? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=194.72s)]
*  He waits until the car [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=196.72s)]
*  It's very relevant though [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=198.72s)]
*  And you've seen those pictures, they're very graphic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=200.72s)]
*  But of JFK's head, it's like a waterman [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=202.72s)]
*  So gross, but it's a brain [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=204.72s)]
*  It's really bad [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=206.72s)]
*  So you can tell the exact angle that it's at [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=208.72s)]
*  You're saying you couldn't make that shot [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=210.72s)]
*  No [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=212.72s)]
*  I would have taken it straight on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=214.72s)]
*  He was military trained [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=216.72s)]
*  But even a country boy like me [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=218.72s)]
*  You can take that straight on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=220.72s)]
*  And even if you took it [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=222.72s)]
*  The point is, he was clearly hit in the front [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=224.72s)]
*  Where the brain is leaving [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=226.72s)]
*  And not the side [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=228.72s)]
*  That kind of wraps the whole case [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=230.72s)]
*  You don't have to know a lot about ballistics [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=232.72s)]
*  You can just look at the photo, look at the window [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=234.72s)]
*  That's an amazing story [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=236.72s)]
*  Jack Ruby has an amazing story [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=238.72s)]
*  You know Trump has that real story [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=240.72s)]
*  All the presidents do [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=242.72s)]
*  And Trump promised he would release it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=244.72s)]
*  And he didn't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=246.72s)]
*  He kept like every day [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=248.72s)]
*  He wouldn't release it, he wouldn't do it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=250.72s)]
*  And was it Alan Dershowitz? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=252.72s)]
*  A well known lawyer [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=254.72s)]
*  I don't think it was Alan [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=256.72s)]
*  But he contacted him and said [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=258.72s)]
*  Why did you not release it? You promised [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=260.72s)]
*  It was a big thing, I helped you campaign [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=262.72s)]
*  I really wanted to know this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=264.72s)]
*  And Trump said, if you knew [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=266.72s)]
*  If they showed you what they showed me [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=268.72s)]
*  You wouldn't have released it either [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=270.72s)]
*  And he's gone [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=272.72s)]
*  All these aliens and stuff, the presidents know that too [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=274.72s)]
*  But Trump has really tried to let us know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=276.72s)]
*  Yes, there is some [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=278.72s)]
*  I'm not going to be like these other presidents [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=280.72s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=282.72s)]
*  But he is trying to let us know [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=284.72s)]
*  For when it does come out [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=286.72s)]
*  Do you believe it? I didn't lie [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=288.72s)]
*  Aliens? Golly, what do you call them? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=290.72s)]
*  Do you call them aliens? No, I don't think there's somebody from like Mars or something like that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=292.72s)]
*  But I got to tell you this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=294.72s)]
*  Everyone that I talked to, and I'm not any different [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=296.72s)]
*  Ghosts and aliens and God himself [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=298.72s)]
*  What did your mother tell you? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=300.72s)]
*  Did your mother tell you there's no such thing as ghosts? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=302.72s)]
*  Alright, then you don't believe in ghosts [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=304.72s)]
*  She told me there was no ghosts, she told me there was no aliens [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=306.72s)]
*  A good friend of mine told me [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=308.72s)]
*  It's a very sound theory, he said aliens are just [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=310.72s)]
*  Agents [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=312.72s)]
*  And that's it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=314.72s)]
*  I don't know how to respond [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=316.72s)]
*  Do we laugh? I don't know either [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=318.72s)]
*  It's your theory [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=320.72s)]
*  I never said that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=322.72s)]
*  They look the most similar [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=324.72s)]
*  It was my theory, my theories [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=326.72s)]
*  They look the most similar, they're the smartest, they probably are the aliens [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=328.72s)]
*  See, I'm glad that happened [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=330.72s)]
*  Because I don't want to laugh and then end up in HR [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=332.72s)]
*  But now I know what you're talking about [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=334.72s)]
*  Why don't you use the ender? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=336.72s)]

*  I gotta tell you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=340.72s)]
*  Have we started the show? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=342.72s)]
*  I don't know, this is what we do [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=344.72s)]
*  When Chael is on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=346.72s)]
*  When the bad guy's on the couch [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=348.72s)]
*  He does whatever the fuck he wants [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=350.72s)]
*  He came on 20 pounds heavier than last time [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=352.72s)]
*  He's jacked the fuck up [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=354.72s)]
*  Steroids in a little glass bottle [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=356.72s)]
*  He's got to fight June 15th [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=358.72s)]
*  The guy's on it [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=360.72s)]
*  Not only [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=362.72s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=364.72s)]
*  There was no salesmanship [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=366.72s)]
*  This fight, apparently that I'm doing with Anderson [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=368.72s)]
*  You can't get a ticket, it's a private event [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=370.72s)]
*  There's a multi-billionaire [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=372.72s)]
*  It's like his company party [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=374.72s)]
*  He owns a beer company [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=376.72s)]
*  This is a black tie event [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=378.72s)]
*  He's not even at an arena [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=380.72s)]
*  He has a place, he set up a ring [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=382.72s)]
*  He called the Brazilian commission [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=384.72s)]
*  Sometimes you'll hear that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=386.72s)]
*  Celine Dion went and sang for Saudi Prince [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=388.72s)]
*  I don't mean to compare ourselves to Celine [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=390.72s)]
*  But it's like that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=392.72s)]
*  We're just going in this room [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=394.72s)]

*  I read somewhere there could be up to 600 [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=398.72s)]
*  There was a zero added [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=400.72s)]
*  I don't know which it is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=402.72s)]
*  I actually think it's going to be closer to 60 [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=404.72s)]
*  There is no distribution, there is no television [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=406.72s)]
*  Somebody will film it but they're not selling it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=408.72s)]
*  Or it's alive [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=410.72s)]
*  What's the check? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=412.72s)]
*  It's a corporate event [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=414.72s)]

*  There was a rounding error [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=440.72s)]
*  It is amazing how you do not let the truth get in the way of a story [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=442.72s)]
*  Just like that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=446.72s)]
*  It was this great thing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=448.72s)]

*  He was always irritated [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=452.72s)]
*  I think there is a part of them [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=454.72s)]
*  To your point [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=456.72s)]

*  He got 10 [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=464.72s)]
*  He does hate budget meetings [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=466.72s)]
*  I heard him say that on a podcast [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=468.72s)]
*  He was like I never want to be in a budget meeting [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=470.72s)]
*  So maybe he missed that one [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=472.72s)]

*  8.8 [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=476.72s)]

*  No, we are not [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=480.72s)]

*  I would have never failed a drug test [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=616.72s)]
*  They did a scumbag move on me called [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=618.72s)]
*  Random testing [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=620.72s)]
*  That had never been done before [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=622.72s)]
*  They would have explained [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=624.72s)]
*  The rules ahead of time [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=626.72s)]
*  I would have manipulated them [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=628.72s)]
*  I didn't know them ahead of time [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=630.72s)]
*  Thank you [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=632.72s)]
*  That's the game really [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=634.72s)]
*  So they can test all they want [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=636.72s)]
*  They can't random test [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=638.72s)]
*  They can't come in and set an eye on it [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=640.72s)]
*  That's a trap [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=642.72s)]
*  That would be a real dirty move [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=644.72s)]
*  It doesn't really matter [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=646.72s)]
*  The fact is you're going to get to go in there [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=648.72s)]
*  You're going to get to beat Anderson Silver for the third time [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=650.72s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=652.72s)]
*  Under any realistic rules [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=654.72s)]
*  It is kind of bullying dude [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=656.72s)]
*  Do you feel bad about that? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=658.72s)]
*  I didn't know how to take it in this regard [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=660.72s)]
*  He [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=662.72s)]
*  Every little piece of my career [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=664.72s)]
*  Does tie to him [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=666.72s)]
*  Whether it was a live gate [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=668.72s)]
*  Or merchandise sales [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=670.72s)]
*  I'm just trying to think [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=672.72s)]
*  Maybe a press conference that somebody would join [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=674.72s)]
*  But it all would tie to him [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=676.72s)]
*  His career is not the same [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=678.72s)]
*  He had a lot of other big matches [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=680.72s)]
*  He had lots of title fights [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=682.72s)]
*  I appreciate that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=684.72s)]
*  Was I the special one? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=686.72s)]
*  Was I special to him? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=688.72s)]
*  In his career [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=690.72s)]
*  Was I meaningful? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=692.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=694.72s)]
*  You're in the documentary [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=696.72s)]
*  To watch it with him on the couch [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=698.72s)]
*  Remember you guys were watching the documentary [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=700.72s)]
*  It was beautiful [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=702.72s)]
*  And you faked those crocodile tears [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=704.72s)]
*  So you can sell this fight [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=706.72s)]
*  Dude look at that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=708.72s)]
*  It's all coming together [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=710.72s)]

*  Those opportunities to go check out the life tour this summer [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=736.72s)]
*  Thank you guys so much [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=738.72s)]
*  For coming out to all the shows throughout the country [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=740.72s)]
*  Shit throughout the world [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=742.72s)]
*  Appreciate you guys so much [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=744.72s)]
*  I'll see you guys out there, peace [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=746.72s)]
*  I'm not going to go along without winning you could do that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=756.72s)]
*  But my point is, Connor really is fighting for a lot [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=758.72s)]
*  If you look at it in that perspective [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=760.72s)]
*  Quite possibly it's his last fight, quite possibly his career is on the line [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=762.72s)]
*  The stakes are bigger than people think [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=764.72s)]
*  Big fight novice, but if I'm thinking Connor macroscopically [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=766.72s)]
*  It feels like he had his peak as a fighter [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=768.72s)]
*  And then it really kind of leveled off [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=770.72s)]
*  Went downhill from there [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=772.72s)]
*  Do you think he just wants to reestablish his legacy as a man? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=774.72s)]
*  Even just one fight [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=776.72s)]
*  I'm going to try to knock this guy out [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=778.72s)]
*  And you're going to remember what I was and then I can be out [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=780.72s)]
*  I think to a degree, I don't know if he's thought it through that clearly [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=782.72s)]
*  But I think to a degree [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=784.72s)]
*  I think he's very sincere when he said he wants to go to the Middle East [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=786.72s)]
*  And box with Manny Pacquiao [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=788.72s)]
*  For whatever reason [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=790.72s)]
*  But they even have a lawsuit [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=792.72s)]
*  Connor's got an 8 million dollar judgement against Manny [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=794.72s)]
*  And he's trying to collect them [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=796.72s)]
*  There's actually a real story there [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=798.72s)]
*  But to a degree I think he sees himself as a fighter [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=800.72s)]
*  Not as an actor [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=802.72s)]
*  Not as a club owner [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=804.72s)]
*  Like I got all that but now I remember [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=806.72s)]
*  Now that I have it and I'm still not full [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=808.72s)]
*  What I am at the end of the day is a fucking fighter [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=810.72s)]
*  I see it with like comedy [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=812.72s)]
*  Jerry Seinfeld goes and does the biggest sitcom ever [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=814.72s)]
*  And he's like no but I'm a comic so I don't care about this [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=816.72s)]
*  I'm walking away at the peak of this thing [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=818.72s)]
*  Because I'm a comedian and I'm coming back to this [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=820.72s)]
*  Can you explain the 8 million dollar thing with Manny Pacquiao? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=822.72s)]
*  I didn't hear about that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=824.72s)]
*  Yeah so Connor McGregor set up a sports company [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=826.72s)]
*  I want to call it McGregor Inc [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=828.72s)]
*  McGregor Sports Entertainment [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=830.72s)]
*  So one of the first guys they signed [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=832.72s)]
*  Connor and his partner Audie [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=834.72s)]
*  Who happens to be a great manager and a lawyer [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=836.72s)]
*  They signed Manny Pacquiao [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=838.72s)]
*  So Manny Pacquiao did the deal [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=840.72s)]
*  They paid him an upfront fee [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=842.72s)]
*  To get him [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=844.72s)]
*  And Pacquiao went and did a deal with somebody else [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=846.72s)]
*  Burned them, didn't do the match [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=848.72s)]
*  And Pacquiao is actually known for that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=850.72s)]
*  I think it was Sports Illustrator [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=852.72s)]
*  But there's a massive publication that said Manny Pacquiao has left [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=854.72s)]
*  Roughly 50 million dollars on the table [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=856.72s)]
*  For having multiple people speaking for him [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=858.72s)]
*  That don't talk [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=860.72s)]
*  Who's the guy? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=862.72s)]
*  Who's this guy? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=864.72s)]
*  He's a tall white guy [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=866.72s)]
*  Conch? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=868.72s)]
*  He's a guy who kind of operated in [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=870.72s)]
*  Boxing circles for Michael Conch [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=872.72s)]
*  American guy? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=874.72s)]
*  Or you said white guy? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=876.72s)]
*  I don't know [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=878.72s)]
*  And Manny is a congressman or something [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=880.72s)]
*  Was I supposed to say his name? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=882.72s)]
*  No, not at all [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=884.72s)]
*  I just thought you might know [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=886.72s)]
*  Michael Conch [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=888.72s)]
*  Yeah apparently he [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=890.72s)]
*  This sometimes happens I imagine [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=892.72s)]
*  With fighters where you need someone [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=894.72s)]
*  Who is your liaison to all the people that are trying to get things from you [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=896.72s)]
*  And there are certain people who are very good [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=898.72s)]
*  At mingling [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=900.72s)]
*  And gaining people's trust [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=902.72s)]
*  And then they gain people's trust [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=904.72s)]
*  And then they became their sole representative [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=906.72s)]
*  In the world [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=908.72s)]
*  And you don't even really know [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=910.72s)]
*  So the question was how much was he meddling [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=912.72s)]
*  I think there was a contract disputes with Golden Boy at one time [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=914.72s)]
*  So I wonder how much of that is the Michael dude [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=916.72s)]
*  And that's one of the things [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=918.72s)]
*  Like if you look at Manny [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=920.72s)]
*  What an unhonorable guy [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=922.72s)]
*  How many times did you give your word and not honor? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=924.72s)]
*  I'm just not positive [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=926.72s)]
*  He knows [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=928.72s)]
*  And I lived a little bit [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=930.72s)]
*  Where you get multiple people, hey can I manage you? Can I do this? Can I do that? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=932.72s)]
*  And you want to help [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=934.72s)]
*  And you tell them yes [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=936.72s)]
*  If you do that, here's the thing [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=938.72s)]
*  But then this other guy that thought he was your manager [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=940.72s)]
*  He's like wait a minute, I'm getting the calls from the same people [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=942.72s)]
*  And you've given this guy the authority [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=944.72s)]
*  And so what ends up happening is this person that finds out [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=946.72s)]
*  Just pulls out [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=948.72s)]
*  And that was what the article on Pacquiao was talking about [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=950.72s)]
*  That he had left roughly 50 million on the table [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=952.72s)]
*  Just for sponsors like PepsiCo [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=954.72s)]
*  For example that looked at it [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=956.72s)]
*  We're out, we don't know who to talk to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=958.72s)]
*  That's going to be a problem [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=960.72s)]
*  So I only suggest that [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=962.72s)]
*  I'm not sure Manny is quite the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=964.72s)]
*  Disappoint for not being a man of his word [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=966.72s)]
*  I do think there's possibly [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=968.72s)]
*  He's got some distractions and doesn't know [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=970.72s)]
*  I think, possibly [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=972.72s)]
*  But Connor and Audie, God bless them [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=974.72s)]
*  Said look, we'll work it out [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=976.72s)]
*  You owe us money and we have a way to pursue you [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=978.72s)]
*  We'll drop it [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=980.72s)]
*  We fight [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=982.72s)]
*  And then he might need a big win in the UFC [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=984.72s)]
*  To propel him to that super stardom again in the fight game [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=986.72s)]
*  To fight one of these boxing guys [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=988.72s)]
*  To make that 100 million [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=990.72s)]
*  You talk about his super stardom [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=992.72s)]
*  I don't know the exact stat, but I believe it's that Connor's not one to fight in five years [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=994.72s)]
*  Whenever the Donald Cerrone fight was [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=996.72s)]
*  Is the one that he's won [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=998.72s)]
*  Or possibly he's only won one fight in five years [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1000.72s)]
*  Which is now six [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1002.72s)]
*  You talk about that, you're on your way down [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1004.72s)]
*  He's fighting Chandler for no reason [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1006.72s)]
*  The International Fight Weekend, which is historically Dana's biggest card of the year [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1008.72s)]
*  Is always capped off with a world title fight [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1010.72s)]
*  Not this time [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1012.72s)]
*  These two [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1014.72s)]
*  It's got no contendership [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1016.72s)]
*  Nobody really knows the weight class, we know it's not 155 [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1018.72s)]
*  And so the media's like, said it's 170 [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1020.72s)]
*  But it's actually never been stated, it could be 168 or 169 [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1022.72s)]
*  And the reason I bring that up, if you don't have a weight class, you have no point for fighting [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1024.72s)]
*  They have no point for fighting [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1026.72s)]
*  Now, before you think I just put the fight down [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1028.72s)]
*  They already have the largest box office [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1030.72s)]
*  In the history of our industry [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1032.72s)]
*  Not just the UFC [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1034.72s)]
*  $23 million [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1036.72s)]
*  And it's not sold out [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1038.72s)]
*  It's going to come in closer to $27 million [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1040.72s)]
*  The UFC has never broken $20 million [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1042.72s)]
*  Their highest gate is 17.2 [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1044.72s)]
*  It was their first time in Madison Square Garden [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1046.72s)]
*  Which by the way, held by Conor McGregor [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1048.72s)]
*  He's beating his own [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1050.72s)]
*  All top 10 records [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1052.72s)]
*  All top 10 pay-per-views are all McGregor [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1054.72s)]
*  And I figured he could still come in at number seven [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1056.72s)]
*  Number eight, beat himself [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1058.72s)]
*  But his heydays, nope [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1060.72s)]
*  He is at his height right now [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1062.72s)]
*  At least at the box office [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1064.72s)]
*  Ever [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1066.72s)]
*  Ever [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1068.72s)]
*  What's the formula? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1070.72s)]
*  I don't know [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1072.72s)]
*  What is the formula? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1074.72s)]
*  What about that movie, by the way? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1076.72s)]
*  He goes and does that movie, Amazon Prime [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1078.72s)]
*  But it was the most watched movie [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1080.72s)]
*  He's a star [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1082.72s)]
*  Conor McGregor's a star [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1084.72s)]
*  And that's a weird word, what does that mean? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1086.72s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to break down [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1088.72s)]
*  What is the formula? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1090.72s)]
*  Without the formula for Conor [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1092.72s)]
*  But Mike Hogan's definition [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1094.72s)]
*  Mike Hogan is the Dana White of Bellator [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1096.72s)]
*  But he said his definition of a star is somebody [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1098.72s)]
*  That regardless of opponent [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1102.72s)]
*  Or what they're doing [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1104.72s)]
*  They could box in this case [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1106.72s)]
*  People are going to stop and watch [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1108.72s)]
*  And he said there's only been a couple [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1110.72s)]
*  He put Kimbo Slice in that category [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1112.72s)]
*  And he had Kimbo in her contract [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1114.72s)]
*  He said that was a massive star [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1116.72s)]
*  He said he couldn't walk down the street with Kimbo Slice [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1118.72s)]
*  At any rate, and then you have McGregor [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1120.72s)]
*  And then you have everybody else [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1122.72s)]
*  But I really didn't know that Conor [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1124.72s)]
*  In this sport that is driven [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1126.72s)]
*  Conor and Chandler have a couple of things in common [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1128.72s)]
*  One, they haven't fought in a meaningful period of time [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1130.72s)]
*  Two, they're not 170 pounders [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1132.72s)]
*  Three, they both lost their last fight [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1134.72s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I think they lost their last couple of fights [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1136.72s)]
*  There is nothing that a main event [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1138.72s)]
*  Or a top draw or a box office hit [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1140.72s)]
*  Ever in history [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1142.72s)]
*  Has these ingredients that you talk about [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1144.72s)]
*  This is a very unique thing [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1146.72s)]
*  And Chandler, he might be my favorite fighter [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1148.72s)]
*  I can't get enough Michael Chandler [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1150.72s)]
*  And then it turns out he's funny [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1152.72s)]
*  And then it turns out he's prepared [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1154.72s)]
*  He's popping in on WWE [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1156.72s)]
*  And he's holding his own with those guys [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1158.72s)]
*  Chandler's great, I'm glad he's back [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1160.72s)]
*  I wonder if [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1162.72s)]
*  An aspect of the stardom [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1164.72s)]
*  Is never knowing [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1166.72s)]
*  What they're going to say [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1168.72s)]
*  So you're compelled to watch [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1170.72s)]
*  Or listen [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1172.72s)]
*  Because you truly cannot predict [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1174.72s)]
*  What's going to come out of their mouth [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1176.72s)]
*  And then you couple that with concussive knockout power [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1178.72s)]
*  In your sport [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1180.72s)]
*  Outside of that, you don't need the concussive [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1182.72s)]
*  Knockout power [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1184.72s)]
*  But Mike Tyson is another example of this [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1186.72s)]
*  You never know what Mike is going to say [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1188.72s)]
*  He always surprises you [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1190.72s)]
*  Sometimes he's like, I give all grace to God [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1192.72s)]
*  I'm a Muslim now [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1194.72s)]
*  You were just eating kids [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1196.72s)]
*  Every day there's a new thing [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1198.72s)]
*  And you have no clue what's going to happen [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1200.72s)]
*  You watch his podcast [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1202.72s)]
*  He's in the washrooms [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1204.72s)]
*  Bill Burr is saying jokes to him [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1206.72s)]
*  He's straight facing him [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1208.72s)]
*  He has no clue what the fuck is going on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1210.72s)]
*  So I think there is this aspect of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1212.72s)]
*  What is he going to say next [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1214.72s)]
*  And when you can also knock people out [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1216.72s)]
*  Why would I not just look at this dude [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1218.72s)]
*  Anthony Edwards [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1220.72s)]
*  Just says whatever the hell he wants [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1222.72s)]
*  I think that's all superstars [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1224.72s)]
*  I really think unpredictability [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1226.72s)]
*  Connie is the same way [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1228.72s)]
*  I think it's a human nature thing [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1230.72s)]
*  And with basketball [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1232.72s)]
*  If you can't really [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1234.72s)]
*  There's not excitement [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1236.72s)]
*  Steph Curry pulling up from 40 feet out is exciting [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1238.72s)]
*  And Duncan on your head is exciting [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1240.72s)]
*  Knockouts in UFC [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1242.72s)]
*  What I was saying is in interviews [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1244.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1246.72s)]
*  To your point [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1248.72s)]
*  So you have to have an elite skill [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1250.72s)]
*  Within the profession [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1252.72s)]
*  I don't know if you even need the elite skill [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1254.72s)]
*  Home runs, you don't have to be a good baseball player [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1256.72s)]
*  But you have to be able to jack home runs [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1258.72s)]
*  I think even on a media level [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1260.72s)]
*  With all due respect to Charleston White [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1262.72s)]
*  You have no idea what he's going to do [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1264.72s)]
*  He's so entertaining because there's something so [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1266.72s)]
*  Mercurial about him [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1268.72s)]
*  He's going to pepper phrase someone, fight someone [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1270.72s)]
*  He's going to get canceled [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1272.72s)]
*  I would say that his skill is also being funny [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1274.72s)]
*  Because he can say anything [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1276.72s)]
*  And be crazy, but he can also be funny [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1278.72s)]
*  And roast [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1280.72s)]
*  It is interesting how that works [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1282.72s)]
*  So it's that unpredictability [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1284.72s)]
*  What the fuck are they going to say [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1286.72s)]
*  Every single time they're in front of a camera [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1288.72s)]
*  Plus a skill [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1290.72s)]
*  And that infuriates people [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1292.72s)]
*  When a guy and his skills or his entertainment [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1294.72s)]
*  Can propel his career [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1296.72s)]
*  It infuriates, but this isn't about who wins [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1298.72s)]
*  It's about who can sell the most tickets [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1300.72s)]
*  No kidding, they say they've just cracked the code [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1302.72s)]
*  You get these young fighters [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1304.72s)]
*  Come out and do interviews [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1306.72s)]
*  He wants to know how many people are interested [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1308.72s)]
*  In seeing you fight, he just revealed something terrible [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1310.72s)]
*  About the organization [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1312.72s)]
*  Oh Dana's a businessman, what an asshole [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1314.72s)]
*  He's going to put these on in events because he wants people to come [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1316.72s)]
*  Oh he wants them to come [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1318.72s)]
*  Well guys, show dates, first of all thank you all so much [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1320.72s)]
*  We're selling it everywhere, it's fucking fantastic [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1322.72s)]
*  And this June [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1324.72s)]
*  21st and 22nd I'm going to be at Good Night's Comedy Club [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1326.72s)]
*  In Raleigh, I expect every Indian [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1328.72s)]
*  In Morristown or wherever that place is to come through [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1330.72s)]
*  June 28th and 29th, Buffalo, New York [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1332.72s)]
*  Then I'm off for a few weeks doing some private gigs [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1334.72s)]
*  July 26th and 27th, Jacksonville [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1336.72s)]
*  And Hawaii, get your tickets [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1338.72s)]
*  I'm coming at the end of August, August 29th and August 30th [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1340.72s)]
*  Honolulu, Hawaii [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1342.72s)]
*  Blue Note Comedy Club, get your tickets for those shows [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1344.72s)]
*  And more at AkashSingh.com [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1346.72s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1348.72s)]
*  Are you vegan? No [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1350.72s)]
*  Do I look it? No [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1352.72s)]
*  I was at a place across the street [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1354.72s)]
*  And they have spaghetti squash [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1356.72s)]
*  And they say you go in [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1358.72s)]
*  And you get the spaghetti squash [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1360.72s)]
*  And I was like, what a torqu- [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1362.72s)]
*  I was giggling [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1364.72s)]
*  I'm like, he does [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1366.72s)]
*  Okay, this is why [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1368.72s)]
*  I'm gay [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1370.72s)]
*  Not that there's anything wrong with that [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1372.72s)]
*  Besides the gay part [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1374.72s)]
*  Is that liable? Could you sue yourself for saying that? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1382.72s)]
*  I could, I could [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1384.72s)]
*  You know regular spaghetti is also vegan, right? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1386.72s)]
*  No, I- [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1388.72s)]
*  That's a great point [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1390.72s)]
*  That's a great fucking point [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1392.72s)]
*  Just eating vegetables [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1394.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1396.72s)]
*  No, you got me, I'm trying to find out what that is [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1398.72s)]
*  It's like, don't you find- [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1400.72s)]
*  Sometimes they eat ham [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1402.72s)]
*  Sometimes, sometimes [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1404.72s)]
*  Or something like that [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1406.72s)]
*  No, I'm trying to stay off the bread, man [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1408.72s)]
*  That's what it is [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1410.72s)]
*  Oh, it's a carb issue [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1412.72s)]
*  It's more gay than what I didn't want to say [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1414.72s)]
*  Being vegan, at least there's something justifiable [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1416.72s)]
*  So they do a spaghetti squash pasta [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1418.72s)]
*  They make pasta, spaghetti squash [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1420.72s)]
*  Did you fucking order it? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1422.72s)]
*  No, but I was- Yes you did [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1424.72s)]
*  How would they tell you if you didn't order it? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1426.72s)]
*  I got this diet thing, I got this fight coming up [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1428.72s)]
*  I put like 13 pounds on me [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1430.72s)]
*  You know how depressing that is by the way? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1432.72s)]
*  You know how depressing that is? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1434.72s)]
*  Working out, watching your weight [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1436.72s)]
*  And gaining 13 pounds in 7 days [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1438.72s)]
*  That sounds like my life, Doug [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1440.72s)]
*  It's miserable [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1442.72s)]
*  It literally will depra- [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1444.72s)]
*  You walk by the mirror, you don't want to look [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1446.72s)]
*  Your belt doesn't fit [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1448.72s)]
*  No, it's a whole thing, but [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1450.72s)]
*  It's part of it, yeah [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1452.72s)]
*  You can start putting on that one [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1454.72s)]
*  It's the opposite, practice is getting harder [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1456.72s)]
*  Because you're gaining weight [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1458.72s)]
*  Your condition is getting worse [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1460.72s)]
*  He's bulking and I think with the fat [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1462.72s)]
*  You still gain muscle [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1464.72s)]
*  You still gain fat with muscle, I think is what he's saying [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1466.72s)]
*  But then the practice getting harder, you're saying your cardio is worse? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1468.72s)]
*  Yeah, because of the added muscle [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1470.72s)]
*  You know what I'm like, you're trying to bounce around and move around [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1472.72s)]
*  It's harder [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1474.72s)]
*  You're a way better person [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1476.72s)]
*  Yeah, slowing me down [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1478.72s)]
*  I thought that your one recovery is way better [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1480.72s)]
*  And to the time in which you can work out is longer [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1482.72s)]
*  For sure [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1484.72s)]
*  Your timing is off in terms of your speed and your cardio [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1486.72s)]
*  But that is managed by the fact that you can work out twice as much to get it back to where it needs to be [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1488.72s)]
*  I think it's worth it, yes [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1490.72s)]
*  I mean like the pain that I would have without manipulating testosterone [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1492.72s)]
*  It would be crazy [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1494.72s)]
*  Yeah, really [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1496.72s)]
*  I'm 47 [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1498.72s)]
*  And I make fun of guys like that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1500.72s)]
*  I make fun of guys that go and try to do a kids sport [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1502.72s)]
*  I tease guys like this [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1504.72s)]
*  And my wife is like, I'm going to go to the gym [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1506.72s)]
*  I'm going to go to the gym [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1508.72s)]
*  I'm going to go to the gym [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1510.72s)]
*  I'm going to go to the gym [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1512.72s)]
*  And my wife is like, what are you doing? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1514.72s)]
*  I don't really know how to answer that question [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1516.72s)]
*  But there was one guy [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1518.72s)]
*  I feel like I am very civilized [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1520.72s)]
*  I would find somebody rude if they challenged me [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1522.72s)]
*  And that's it, what a jerk [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1524.72s)]
*  Can I ask you a quick question? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1526.72s)]
*  Find somebody rude [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1528.72s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that's a rude thing to do [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1530.72s)]
*  But it wouldn't be like, alright, well I'll see you outside [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1532.72s)]
*  Except with him [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1534.72s)]
*  How are things with your wife? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1536.72s)]
*  She's so hot [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1538.72s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1540.72s)]
*  Because you said that last time, and I don't respect I didn't look [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1542.72s)]
*  But you, you were [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1544.72s)]
*  There was a moment in the last one [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1546.72s)]
*  I was telling you how pretty [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1548.72s)]
*  I was doing some bit [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1550.72s)]
*  And he and I got into a conversation [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1552.72s)]
*  And her name is saved in my phone as Brittany Hoddy [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1554.72s)]
*  Somewhere you saw it, she texted my phone [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1556.72s)]
*  And you said, I have that same number, Brittany Hoddy [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1558.72s)]
*  That was the funniest thing [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1560.72s)]
*  I have thought about that after [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1562.72s)]
*  And I don't even know that I laugh out loud [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1564.72s)]
*  I cannot wait until I can do that to someone else [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1566.72s)]
*  I think that I'm a comedic genius [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1568.72s)]
*  I really like that joke [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1570.72s)]
*  But she's good, everything's good with wifey? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1572.72s)]
*  Oh, she's incredible [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1574.72s)]
*  Is she upset about you fighting? Has that ever been an issue? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1576.72s)]
*  Or she supports that [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1578.72s)]
*  Are things good with her? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1580.72s)]
*  Oh, believe me [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1582.72s)]
*  Every day [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1584.72s)]
*  Have you seen this girl as a bomb rocket? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1586.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1588.72s)]
*  She had a birthday not that long ago [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1592.72s)]
*  And we celebrated, it was like 11 o'clock at night [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1594.72s)]
*  She's 32 years old [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1596.72s)]
*  I ran into the bedroom [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1598.72s)]
*  I said, you are 32 [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1600.72s)]
*  I can't believe I married this old woman [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1602.72s)]
*  And she's like [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1604.72s)]
*  Don't remind me [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1606.72s)]
*  I don't know why, but in my mind she was still like 26 [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1608.72s)]
*  Or something [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1610.72s)]
*  Has that happened to you yet? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1612.72s)]
*  Hey, my dad, I used to ask him [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1614.72s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1616.72s)]
*  And he'd have to stop and think [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1618.72s)]
*  I'm like, what an act [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1620.72s)]
*  But you do, you forget [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1622.72s)]
*  I thought I was 48 [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1624.72s)]
*  It turned out I was 47 [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1626.72s)]
*  It was this great day [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1628.72s)]
*  He had the opposite, I remember [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1630.72s)]
*  I aged two years in one day [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1632.72s)]
*  I was 26 when I was 28 [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1634.72s)]
*  He was telling me you were 26 [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1636.72s)]
*  I thought it was on the birthday [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1638.72s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm 26 and then on the birthday [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1640.72s)]
*  Where I was going to turn 27, I turned 28 [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1642.72s)]
*  They were at the birthday party [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1644.72s)]
*  They were saying happy birthday, what does it feel like to be 28? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1646.72s)]
*  I was like, I'll tell you next year [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1648.72s)]
*  How would I know? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1650.72s)]
*  28 of course feels so young now [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1652.72s)]
*  She's great, Brittany's great [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1654.72s)]
*  She's wonderful [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1656.72s)]
*  She's upset you're fighting her now [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1658.72s)]
*  She's going to go [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1660.72s)]
*  You're going to let her go to the slums of [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1662.72s)]
*  South Paulo, Brazil [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1664.72s)]
*  Taking my kids and everything [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1666.72s)]
*  My son, eight years old, is cornering me [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1668.72s)]
*  No way [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1670.72s)]
*  Brittany's father will be the head corner man [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1672.72s)]
*  But my son will carry the bucket [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1674.72s)]
*  He's excited about it [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1676.72s)]
*  This is nuts to me [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1678.72s)]
*  What if you really hurt Anderson? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1680.72s)]
*  Your kid is going to see that [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1682.72s)]
*  You kill a guy [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1684.72s)]
*  He wasn't alive when we fought the first time [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1686.72s)]
*  But he's watched it a million times [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1688.72s)]
*  His classmates have watched it [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1690.72s)]
*  He's seen it on YouTube [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1692.72s)]
*  It feels very new to him [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1694.72s)]
*  He doesn't look at it [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1696.72s)]
*  And go, hey, what are you guys doing? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1698.72s)]
*  This is weird, what are you guys doing? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1700.72s)]
*  He doesn't look at it like that [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1702.72s)]
*  He's like, yeah, we've got to box Anderson [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1704.72s)]
*  You've got to leave that hand [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1706.72s)]
*  He dips right into it [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1708.72s)]
*  I don't know if any of those things are true [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1710.72s)]
*  But he's watched enough Rocky [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1712.72s)]
*  It's very fun [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1714.72s)]
*  There will be a day that we will look back on that [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1716.72s)]
*  If your kid loves what you do [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1718.72s)]
*  That's got to be so awesome [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1720.72s)]
*  Do you knock out Anderson Silva [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1722.72s)]
*  In your third fight? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1724.72s)]
*  I would not predict that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1726.72s)]
*  I am not going out there strategically [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1728.72s)]
*  We can't bet on this thing, right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1730.72s)]
*  It's not even really sanctioned [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1732.72s)]
*  It is sanctioned [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1734.72s)]
*  They got the commission [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1736.72s)]
*  The commission operates, at least in America [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1738.72s)]
*  Off of 6% of the gate [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1740.72s)]
*  So when you're not doing a gate [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1742.72s)]
*  I don't quite know how that works [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1744.72s)]
*  But they did not want the word exhibition tied to this [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1746.72s)]
*  It was important [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1748.72s)]
*  Even for his own buddies [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1750.72s)]
*  They just did not want that [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1752.72s)]
*  Anyway, we got to weigh in [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1754.72s)]
*  But they didn't bring the drug commission in [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1756.72s)]
*  They could test you there [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1758.72s)]
*  But they have to test you there [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1760.72s)]
*  Is my point [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1762.72s)]
*  It's the random test [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1764.72s)]
*  That could get a guy in a jam [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1766.72s)]
*  It's the surprise test [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1768.72s)]
*  Otherwise, if you know what you're doing [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1770.72s)]
*  Particularly if you're on pharmaceutical grades [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1772.72s)]
*  You also have a pretty good idea when it's out of your system [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1774.72s)]
*  The benefits will remain [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1776.72s)]
*  But it's out of your system [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1778.72s)]
*  Has Ryan Garcia [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1780.72s)]
*  Exposed [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1782.72s)]
*  That it doesn't really matter [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1784.72s)]
*  If you don't make weight [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1786.72s)]
*  It doesn't really matter [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1788.72s)]
*  If you're on the juice [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1790.72s)]
*  You put on an amazing performance [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1792.72s)]
*  And you muddy the waters [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1794.72s)]
*  With enough unbelievably entertaining build up [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1796.72s)]
*  It was amazing [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1798.72s)]
*  I am so fascinated [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1800.72s)]
*  This has never happened [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1802.72s)]
*  The public has not changed [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1804.72s)]
*  The public has loosened on marijuana [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1806.72s)]
*  The public has loosened on straight drugs [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1808.72s)]
*  They have not loosened [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1810.72s)]
*  On PDs [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1812.72s)]
*  No, not at all [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1814.72s)]
*  Particularly in combat [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1816.72s)]
*  He is suffering [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1818.72s)]
*  Nothing [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1820.72s)]
*  And one of the things that's unique [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1822.72s)]
*  Is the commission [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1824.72s)]
*  Has not suspended him [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1826.72s)]
*  Generally every announcement that we get [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1828.72s)]
*  Would come from the commission [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1830.72s)]
*  That says we have a negative assay [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1832.72s)]
*  It's put right in the press release [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1834.72s)]
*  The exact date [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1836.72s)]
*  Along with the address [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1838.72s)]
*  Of where his arbitration will be held [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1840.72s)]
*  And until this is resolved [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1842.72s)]
*  His license is hereby suspended [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1844.72s)]
*  That has never happened [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1846.72s)]
*  I mean, it's not like that [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1848.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1850.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1852.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1854.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1856.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1858.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1860.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1862.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1864.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1866.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1868.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1870.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1872.72s)]
*  It's not like that [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1874.72s)]
*  To whatever [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1876.72s)]
*  Is he overweight? Was this planned? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1878.72s)]
*  Did he try to make it? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1880.72s)]
*  You didn't even know if he was going to show up on fight day [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1882.72s)]
*  It was so genius the way that [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1884.72s)]
*  Every bit of information about this fight [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1886.72s)]
*  That was in the promo [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1888.72s)]
*  Was either true or false [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1890.72s)]
*  And you had no clue, it was just entertaining [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1892.72s)]
*  So now every piece of information about the fight afterwards [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1894.72s)]
*  You're like, is it true or false? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1896.72s)]
*  I don't care [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1898.72s)]
*  Unpredictable [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1900.72s)]
*  And when you're unpredictable [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1902.72s)]
*  It's awesome [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1904.72s)]
*  I didn't know what to make of it either [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1906.72s)]
*  He's never been a great troll [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1908.72s)]
*  He's never been great at media [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1910.72s)]
*  He tried to be a face [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1912.72s)]
*  I remember watching the Tank Showtime series [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1914.72s)]
*  And I was like, it just seems phony [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1916.72s)]
*  He's trying to be like this great guy [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1918.72s)]
*  And then it just completely won [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1920.72s)]
*  And he's got nobody helping him [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1922.72s)]
*  He didn't get some Hollywood writer [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1924.72s)]
*  That he bumped into [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1926.72s)]
*  That happened to me one time [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1928.72s)]
*  I was at a Starbucks and I met a guy that introduced [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1930.72s)]
*  And he started helping me with some bits and material [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1932.72s)]
*  I mean it's like one of these things [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1934.72s)]
*  Garcia doesn't have that [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1936.72s)]
*  He went out in business completely for himself [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1938.72s)]
*  He looked like a total fool [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1940.72s)]
*  It all worked out [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1942.72s)]
*  I mean it is so brilliant [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1944.72s)]
*  I love what you said about mud in the water [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1946.72s)]
*  I also don't know what the reality is [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1948.72s)]
*  And I think we get this exhaustion [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1950.72s)]
*  When we don't know what is [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1952.72s)]
*  This is just with media in general [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1954.72s)]
*  When we don't know what is true or false [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1956.72s)]
*  We just kind of remove ourselves [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1958.72s)]
*  We're like, oh, so nothing is really real? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1960.72s)]
*  I'm not going to read a whole fucking article [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1962.72s)]
*  If this is going to end up being fake [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1964.72s)]
*  And then you just kind of create a little bit of separation [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1966.72s)]
*  From it and now you don't care as much what is true or false [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1968.72s)]
*  Did he use the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1970.72s)]
*  Osterine or whatever? Did he not? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1972.72s)]
*  What is Osterine even for? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1974.72s)]
*  What is it for? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1976.72s)]
*  It's a chick steroid [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1978.72s)]
*  Basically, I mean you know more [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1980.72s)]
*  Well the guys that test positive for [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1982.72s)]
*  There's another one [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1984.72s)]
*  And Anderstein by the way [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1986.72s)]
*  And they are generally [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1988.72s)]
*  Are taking a banned substance [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1990.72s)]
*  That was tainted with that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1992.72s)]
*  Like they weren't actually set out to take that [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1994.72s)]
*  I'll use John Jones [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1996.72s)]
*  Just because it's a name that you know [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=1998.72s)]
*  Not to pick on John [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2000.72s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2002.72s)]
*  To defend him [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2004.72s)]
*  You would have to go to a museum to find what they found [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2006.72s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2008.72s)]
*  There is no chance that he meant to take that [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2010.72s)]
*  He did a lie detector test [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2012.72s)]
*  For sure he could pass that [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2014.72s)]
*  Victor Conte speculated on the Joe Rogan program [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2016.72s)]
*  That he was taking a banned substance [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2018.72s)]
*  But it was tainted with that one [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2020.72s)]
*  Sorry just real quick [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2022.72s)]
*  Does tainted mean that he's taking [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2024.72s)]
*  A concoction that has a piece of it in it? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2026.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2028.72s)]
*  On accident though that's the tainted part [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2030.72s)]
*  Okay so when something comes from China [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2032.72s)]
*  A lot of times they will reuse a used bottle [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2034.72s)]
*  And so there's some that's in the [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2036.72s)]
*  So they have a used bottle [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2038.72s)]
*  That once upon a time had [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2040.72s)]
*  Osterine in it [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2042.72s)]
*  But it's empty there's nothing in there [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2044.72s)]
*  But there actually is [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2046.72s)]
*  Yeah that's right so they come in and they [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2048.7200000000003s)]
*  Insert the whatever [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2050.7200000000003s)]
*  You're taking the whatever [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2052.7200000000003s)]
*  And most of the good stuff actually comes from China [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2054.7200000000003s)]
*  Like some of the great growth hormones and what not [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  And by the way I kind of now [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2058.7200000000003s)]
*  Want to disassociate John [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  He didn't do that I was just using his name [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2062.7200000000003s)]
*  As an example where that's one of the big guesses [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2064.7200000000003s)]
*  When you have some of those really weird ones [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  Then you get guys that are innocent [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2068.7200000000003s)]
*  Yoel Romero turned out to be completely innocent [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  The company that sold him like his protein powder [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2072.72s)]
*  Or whatever that had a banned substance [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2074.72s)]
*  That they didn't put on the label [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2076.72s)]
*  He won 40 million dollars [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2078.72s)]
*  They did not pay he bankrupted a company though [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2080.72s)]
*  Because he was so innocent [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2082.72s)]
*  No I couldn't even tell you the name of the company [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2084.72s)]
*  They were gone [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2086.72s)]
*  Does that do anything? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2088.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2090.72s)]
*  It would I mean it would be bigger stronger faster [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2092.72s)]
*  Just like all the way up [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2094.72s)]
*  It's just not a good one [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2096.72s)]
*  The way that I was [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2098.72s)]
*  It was described to me was it basically [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2100.72s)]
*  Gives you those positive effects [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2102.72s)]
*  But then with the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2104.72s)]
*  Old steroids with those positive effects [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2106.72s)]
*  The bigger faster stronger you would also have these [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2108.72s)]
*  Negative [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2110.72s)]
*  Physical characteristics [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2112.72s)]
*  You would get the tits [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2114.72s)]
*  You would get the gynos you would get the balls [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2116.72s)]
*  So with Ostrin [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2118.72s)]
*  My understanding was that it did [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2120.72s)]
*  Something to offset the negative physical [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2122.72s)]
*  Characteristics and that's why I think [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2124.72s)]
*  It was safe for chicks to take it for competitions [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2126.72s)]
*  Because they wouldn't grow [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2128.72s)]
*  Shlongs or whatever tits and hair and facial [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2130.72s)]
*  And a lot of times if they find the Ostrin [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2132.72s)]
*  The drug collectors believe [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2134.72s)]
*  That okay we missed what you were really using [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2136.72s)]
*  But you used this as a cover [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2138.72s)]
*  We caught the cover which means [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2140.72s)]
*  You must have been doing something else even though we didn't find [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2142.72s)]
*  The something which again it's speculation [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2144.72s)]
*  But [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2146.72s)]
*  Ostrin pops up a lot [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2148.72s)]
*  Okay so is this the way [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2150.72s)]
*  One I mean Ryan can sell any fight now [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2152.72s)]
*  And he's [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2154.72s)]
*  I wonder what what do you say I mean I think you only have one [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2156.72s)]
*  One way to do this [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2158.72s)]
*  What he did like if he does this again [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2160.72s)]
*  And he's crazy again in a year [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2162.72s)]
*  I think we're gonna be like alright okay [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2164.72s)]
*  I wonder if he has [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2166.72s)]
*  Become fluent [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2168.72s)]
*  In media attention [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2170.72s)]
*  If you do it twice then it's like oh [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2172.72s)]
*  Yeah in other words he's [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2174.72s)]
*  You know this happens with comedy [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2176.72s)]
*  It happens with learning a language it happens with fighting [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2178.72s)]
*  I'm sure it's like you eventually learn [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2180.72s)]
*  Enough that you have a fluency in it [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2182.72s)]
*  You know when you [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2184.72s)]
*  Turn it on whenever you want [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2186.72s)]
*  Or when you [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2188.72s)]
*  Twist it to another direction yeah I know what you mean [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2190.72s)]
*  And I wonder if he's like oh now I know how to [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2192.72s)]
*  Promote fights and it doesn't have to be done in this exact [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2194.72s)]
*  Same way maybe he could be sad boy [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2196.72s)]
*  Next time guys I feel so sad I don't want to kill [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2198.72s)]
*  Myself I don't even know if I'm gonna make it there [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2200.72s)]
*  Like what's it and now we're just like what the fuck [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2202.72s)]
*  Is going on what is he saying [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2204.72s)]
*  Is he now fluent in media [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2206.72s)]
*  And can he sell any [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2208.72s)]
*  And that would go back to your point of being unpredictable [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2210.72s)]
*  Once you have the audience you have the audience [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2212.72s)]
*  The hardest thing is to get them [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2214.72s)]
*  Stop what they're doing okay something's happening here [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2216.72s)]
*  But once you have them and he does [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2218.72s)]
*  I would imagine the Devin Haney rematch is [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2220.72s)]
*  The biggest fight right isn't that [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2222.72s)]
*  I don't care for that yeah really no [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2224.72s)]
*  I think Tank I'd be kind of interested in [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2226.72s)]
*  I want to see Tank with no [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2228.72s)]
*  And he has to lean into the rehydration clause [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2230.72s)]
*  He has to make Tank's victory [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2232.72s)]
*  All about the fact that he was drained [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2234.72s)]
*  Sure and who am I to tell him [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2236.72s)]
*  What to do do whatever the fuck you want but [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2238.72s)]
*  In your opinion [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2240.72s)]
*  Yeah like cause you could create [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2242.72s)]
*  This little seed of doubt [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2244.72s)]
*  In the audience's mind oh maybe it was the rehydration [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2246.72s)]
*  When he came in three pounds overweight against Haney [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2248.72s)]
*  Dominated him holy shit [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2250.72s)]
*  What if that same thing could happen with Tank [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2252.72s)]
*  And I think that's Tank's biggest money fight [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2254.72s)]
*  Like if I'm Tank and I already beat this guy [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2256.72s)]
*  And you're telling me I can make 5x by fighting him [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2258.72s)]
*  Again even at a heavier weight [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2260.72s)]
*  No brainer [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2262.72s)]
*  I agree with that why was Tank [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2264.72s)]
*  Not on an Olympic team [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2266.72s)]
*  I mean who kept him off or Ryan Garcia [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2268.72s)]
*  Why were they I think Ryan tried right [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2270.72s)]
*  And then he decided to go pro [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2272.72s)]
*  Did he lose the box off [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2274.72s)]
*  Or he just decided to go pro [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2276.72s)]
*  I'm not sure but he had like a big amateur [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2278.72s)]
*  Career but [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2280.72s)]
*  And then I wonder if Tank was just like scooped up by [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2282.72s)]
*  The Mayweathers [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2284.72s)]
*  And they were like why are you wasting your time [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2286.72s)]
*  Why are you wasting prime years when you could be fighting for real money [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2288.72s)]
*  And that might be what I'm asking [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2290.72s)]
*  Is that how boxers look at it do they not hold the Olympics [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2292.72s)]
*  As coveted as they used to [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2294.72s)]
*  It used to be your best promotional tool [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2296.72s)]
*  Remember when [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2298.72s)]
*  Roy golden boy all of them [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2300.72s)]
*  Sure right like these guys [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2302.72s)]
*  Roy Jones getting robbed in Korea [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2304.72s)]
*  Robbed they robbed the Korean apologized [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2306.72s)]
*  On the stands on the stand he told him [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2308.72s)]
*  I am sorry [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2310.72s)]
*  Sports where you can make a lot of money here [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2312.72s)]
*  We don't take the Olympics seriously [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2314.72s)]
*  Even in basketball [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2316.72s)]
*  But if over there you can't really make that much money [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2318.72s)]
*  An American hasn't won a boxing gold since [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2320.72s)]
*  76 [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2322.72s)]
*  Once you can cast into doubt [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2324.72s)]
*  That it's going to be legit [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2326.72s)]
*  I'm going to beat this guys ass and still maybe lose [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2328.72s)]
*  Why am I putting my health on the line [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2330.72s)]
*  When I could just go make money [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2332.72s)]
*  I mean what's it called [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2334.72s)]
*  Deandre [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2336.72s)]
*  The bronze bomber [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2338.72s)]
*  Deandre oh yeah Wilder [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2340.72s)]
*  Wilder he won Deandre [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2342.72s)]
*  And he still put it in his name [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2344.72s)]
*  I was reading one way class [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2348.72s)]
*  You're right actually there were more Americans [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2350.72s)]
*  That have won more recently [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2352.72s)]
*  Deandre Wilder [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2354.72s)]
*  Deandre not Deandre [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2356.72s)]
*  Very like a kind of a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2358.72s)]
*  Frightening looking guy he's got that look [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2360.72s)]
*  Kind of like a rough guy look apparently [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2362.72s)]
*  I think it's called DMT [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2364.72s)]
*  But it's something that's out there [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2366.72s)]
*  And it kind of reprograms your mind [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2368.72s)]
*  He did that and is no longer [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2370.72s)]
*  The mean [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2372.72s)]
*  No longer has everything that made him [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2374.72s)]
*  He went and did a boxing match [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2376.72s)]
*  And it was bad [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2378.72s)]
*  I'm not mistaken [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2380.72s)]
*  Looked at a shape or maybe under motivated [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2382.72s)]
*  But Joseph is also like a sharp guy [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2384.72s)]
*  A good fighter DMT is the opposite of whatever [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2386.72s)]
*  Steroid is [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2388.72s)]
*  But I love that for a fighter [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2390.72s)]
*  Once they made their money I love that you [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2392.72s)]
*  Had 8.8 million allegedly in a fight [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2394.72s)]
*  Got out you made your money now you're doing this [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2396.72s)]
*  You're healthy I love that for Deandre [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2398.72s)]
*  I took enough brain punishment [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2400.72s)]
*  Now I'm on the DMT But now he's going a better path [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2402.72s)]
*  They can't let it go [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2404.72s)]
*  They fucking need it anymore I will ask them [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2406.72s)]
*  The one fighter that got his ass beat would be [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2408.72s)]
*  Wake Up Call [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2410.72s)]
*  I feel like they have to suspend Garcia [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2412.72s)]
*  Because if they don't then they let him fight again [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2414.72s)]
*  Now every fighter can be like [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2416.72s)]
*  Yo he did it [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2418.72s)]
*  Well you only suspend him if he actually did violate it [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2420.72s)]
*  And if the New York State Athletic Commission [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2422.72s)]
*  Hasn't said anything did he violate it? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2424.72s)]
*  That's where it gets interesting [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2426.72s)]
*  He popped under VADA [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2428.72s)]
*  The voluntary [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2430.72s)]
*  Anti-doping agency [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2432.72s)]
*  So these two guys agreed to [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2434.72s)]
*  Reject themselves to something that they didn't need to [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2436.72s)]
*  But they don't have any [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2438.72s)]
*  Adjudication power [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2440.72s)]
*  None, VADA doesn't [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2442.72s)]
*  Say he popped [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2444.72s)]
*  But that's enough for other places [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2446.72s)]
*  Like if Usada would hit you and you fought Nevada [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2448.72s)]
*  Nevada would bring you in and suspend you under [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2450.72s)]
*  There was things that could happen [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2452.72s)]
*  But it hasn't happened yet [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2454.72s)]
*  And the week that this happened [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2456.72s)]
*  I actually called the executive director Kim Sumler [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2458.72s)]
*  Very very good director by the way [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2460.72s)]
*  She resigned [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2462.72s)]
*  No relation but she was done [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2464.72s)]
*  So there wasn't even a new one [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2466.72s)]
*  In place to speak to [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2468.72s)]
*  One day that I pursued it I dropped it [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2470.72s)]
*  This is my own story [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2472.72s)]
*  New York hasn't suspended him [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2474.72s)]
*  He technically could take a fight and might [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2476.72s)]
*  Against Jake Paul in Texas [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2478.72s)]
*  If that comes about [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2480.72s)]
*  Alright guys I'm going to take a break for a second because I need to tell you about Symbiotica [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2482.72s)]
*  Listen [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2484.72s)]
*  Y'all know I dump too frequently [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2486.72s)]
*  I thought it was [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2488.72s)]
*  The perfect amount I'm like I'm eating three meals a day [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2490.72s)]
*  I'm at least taking three to five dumps a day [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2492.72s)]
*  Turns out that's not how many [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2494.72s)]
*  You're supposed to take [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2496.72s)]
*  And gut health is going to be the thing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2498.72s)]
*  That gives you the solution to your problem [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2500.72s)]
*  And by you I mean me [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2502.72s)]
*  I need to look after my gut health [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2504.72s)]
*  Something was going on over there and Symbiotica [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2506.72s)]
*  Has my back [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2508.72s)]
*  Symbiotica is changing up my gut [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2510.72s)]
*  And Symbiotica is going to save me [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2512.72s)]
*  Tens of dollars on toilet paper [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2514.72s)]
*  There are endless [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2516.72s)]
*  Positive outcomes with Symbiotica [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2518.72s)]
*  Now I started taking Symbiotica [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2520.72s)]
*  Because obviously my gut [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2522.72s)]
*  As I'm getting older my shits are not as good [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2524.72s)]
*  As they used to be [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2526.72s)]
*  And I wanted to change that [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2528.72s)]
*  So I started taking their activated charcoal [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2530.72s)]
*  And their probiotic [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2532.72s)]
*  And it's been absolutely incredible [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2534.72s)]
*  My bowels [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2536.72s)]
*  I don't even want to say my bowels are back because they've never been [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2538.72s)]
*  My bowels are normal [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2540.72s)]
*  Okay [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2542.72s)]
*  It's nice to have normal bowels [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2544.72s)]
*  My wife is getting way more time with me [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2546.72s)]
*  I have to find a way to fake poops [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2548.72s)]
*  I have to fake poops now [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2550.72s)]
*  Symbiotica has made me have to fake poops [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2552.72s)]
*  I have to pretend I'm pooping [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2554.72s)]
*  Go in the bathroom [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2556.72s)]
*  Scroll Instagram for an hour [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2558.72s)]
*  Whatever I used to do [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2560.72s)]
*  So that I can still get that me time [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2562.72s)]
*  Okay [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2564.72s)]
*  Keep that in mind [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2566.72s)]
*  Also Symbiotica by the way is one of the only companies [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2568.72s)]
*  That uses no seed oils [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2570.72s)]
*  No preservatives, no toxins [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2572.72s)]

*  Okay, let's talk about something important [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2604.72s)]
*  If you are injured by the negligence [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2606.72s)]
*  Of another you deserve to be paid [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2608.72s)]
*  Life can be crazy sometimes [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2610.72s)]
*  And one person's negligence can result in [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2612.72s)]
*  Another person's settlement [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2614.72s)]
*  If you're in an accident, not calling a lawyer [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2616.72s)]
*  Means you could be leaving money on a table [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2618.72s)]
*  And when you're seriously hurt, your injury could be worth [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2620.72s)]
*  Millions [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2622.72s)]
*  Of dollars [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2624.72s)]
*  Okay, if you're ever injured you can check out Morgan & Morgan [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2626.72s)]
*  I'm telling you right now [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2628.72s)]
*  Morgan & Morgan is America's largest injury [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2630.72s)]

*  And more than 1000 lawyers [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2636.72s)]
*  With over 20 billion dollars [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2638.72s)]

*  Morgan & Morgan has a proven track record [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2646.72s)]
*  Of fighting to get you full and fair [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2648.72s)]
*  Compensation [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2650.72s)]
*  Getting injured because of someone else's negligence [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2652.72s)]
*  Is hard to go through [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2654.72s)]
*  But luckily submitting an injury claim with Morgan & Morgan [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2656.72s)]
*  Is easy [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2658.72s)]
*  The easiest way to get a claim is using an app [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2660.72s)]
*  I know it sounds crazy, but that's how they have developed it [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2662.72s)]
*  I'm telling you it is that simple [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2664.72s)]
*  You just go to [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2666.72s)]
*  Morgan & Morgan [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2668.72s)]
*  Okay, you go to their website [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2670.72s)]
*  Which is forthepeople.com [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2672.72s)]
*  Or dial pound law [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2674.72s)]
*  That is pound 529 for your cell phone [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2676.72s)]
*  That is forthepeople.com [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2678.72s)]
*  Or pound [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2680.72s)]
*  Law, pound 529 for your cell [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2682.72s)]
*  This is a paid advertisement [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2684.72s)]
*  Just to let you know [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2686.72s)]
*  Morgan & Morgan is going to take care of you [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2688.72s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2690.72s)]
*  While we're unboxing, did you watch Fury Usyk? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2692.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2694.72s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2696.72s)]
*  Well, I didn't know that Usyk was that good, quite frankly [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2698.72s)]
*  I really thought some of that was for show [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2700.72s)]
*  But the way he went out there and represented his country [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2702.72s)]
*  I had discussed [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2704.72s)]
*  And got a lot of heat for it [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2706.72s)]
*  I had just discussed if these two guys [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2708.72s)]
*  30 days before the fight, these two guys go the distance [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2710.72s)]
*  The judges are going to give it to Usyk [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2712.72s)]
*  On the mere fact that his country is at war [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2714.72s)]
*  And I had a lot of trouble [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2716.72s)]
*  I had to get back to me [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2718.72s)]
*  Tyson said it [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2720.72s)]
*  The moment it hit [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2722.72s)]
*  He watched his bad guy, Inc. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2724.72s)]
*  I don't know if they were related, but he took a lot of heat for it [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2726.72s)]
*  And it's like, well, you could be mad at him [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2728.72s)]
*  And it might be an insensitive statement [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2730.72s)]
*  I think he's right, I really do [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2732.72s)]
*  I think the judges are going to go [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2734.72s)]
*  No, I didn't [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2736.72s)]
*  I think he's right in that [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2738.72s)]
*  Had they gone a decision, it's likely to go against him [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2740.72s)]
*  But no, I thought he lost [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2742.72s)]
*  I'm concerned, I thought Tyson was the greatest [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2744.72s)]
*  Heavyweight boxer in history [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2746.72s)]
*  And I really follow boxing [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2748.72s)]
*  I've tried to do the math [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2750.72s)]
*  Of who could potentially beat him [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2752.72s)]
*  And when he was in his heyday, I don't know [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2754.72s)]
*  After the Nganu fight [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2756.72s)]
*  And this fight [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2758.72s)]
*  I don't know if we're witnessing [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2760.72s)]
*  Him not taking it seriously [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2762.72s)]
*  Anymore, or just the end [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2764.72s)]
*  Of a very long career [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2766.72s)]
*  At the toughest division [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2768.72s)]
*  Because Usyk just outboxed him [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2770.72s)]
*  Like usually, Tyson [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2772.72s)]
*  With a much smaller guy can keep him at distance [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2774.72s)]
*  He's bouncing around [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2776.72s)]
*  He's hurting him when he needs to [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2778.72s)]
*  He hurt Usyk maybe a couple times [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2780.72s)]
*  But Usyk was relentless [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2782.72s)]
*  And just outsmarted him in the ring [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2784.72s)]
*  He was hitting him with these straight lefts to the body [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2786.72s)]
*  And [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2788.72s)]
*  If you notice [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2790.72s)]
*  It would open up that looping left upstairs [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2792.72s)]
*  And that's what fucking dropped [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2794.72s)]
*  Fury saw it [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2796.72s)]
*  He started to lock his right hand by the jaw [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2798.72s)]
*  But the second he got lazy [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2800.72s)]
*  He gets clipped [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2802.72s)]
*  And I'm watching this and I'm like, oh my god [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2804.72s)]
*  One, I see how legacies die [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2806.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2808.72s)]
*  Because if you just watch these last two fights [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2810.72s)]
*  You'll go, oh there's no way Tyson was [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2812.72s)]
*  The greatest heavyweight boxer of all time [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2814.72s)]
*  But if you saw him at his fucking heyday [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2816.72s)]
*  You'd go, there's no human being [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2818.72s)]
*  On planet earth that could ever beat this guy [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2820.72s)]
*  So is this what we remember him by? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2822.72s)]
*  That was a great analysis [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2824.72s)]
*  By the way, and I totally co-signed that [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2826.72s)]
*  I also think of him that same way [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2828.72s)]
*  Like, okay, who's going to beat Tyson? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2830.72s)]
*  Somebody that can knock him out [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2832.72s)]
*  But when you see him sit up and get up [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2834.72s)]
*  It's like, no, I don't believe that he [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2836.72s)]
*  Tyson and some of these big punchers [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2838.72s)]
*  Even George Foreman, who might be the hardest puncher [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2840.72s)]
*  Could knock him out, it is different [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2842.72s)]
*  By the way, we're speaking of the Olympics [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2844.72s)]
*  Didn't Usyk win the gold in 16? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2846.72s)]
*  Wasn't he an Olympic champion for his country? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2848.72s)]
*  And I know Fury went down that path [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2850.72s)]
*  Didn't make the Olympic team [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2852.72s)]
*  But when you talk about [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2854.72s)]
*  Maybe he's not as sharp or maybe he's not taking [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2856.72s)]
*  He's quite as serious [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2858.72s)]
*  I would agree that that could be part of it, however [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2860.72s)]
*  He is still hanging in there [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2862.72s)]
*  12 rounds, 36 minutes [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2864.72s)]
*  When you're getting beat up [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2866.72s)]
*  He has the heart [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2868.72s)]
*  He has unbelievable heart [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2870.72s)]
*  To have that conditioning, to be able to hold up [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2872.72s)]
*  You had to have done that in the gym [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2874.72s)]
*  And you can't, if you're not still there [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2876.72s)]
*  And you're not still motivated, you're not the eye of the tiger [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2878.72s)]
*  You can't put that time in the gym [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2880.72s)]
*  The two just don't work out [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2882.72s)]
*  I feel like Fury didn't get credit for the Francis fight [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2884.72s)]
*  He found himself in a competition [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2886.72s)]
*  Way harder than he thought it was going to be [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2888.72s)]
*  And that is where guys unfold [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2890.72s)]
*  And he stood in there for 30 minutes [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2892.72s)]
*  And tried to figure out a way to win [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2894.72s)]
*  He's unbelievably courageous [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2896.72s)]
*  He is brave and he is tough [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2898.72s)]
*  That guy is tough as fucking nails [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2900.72s)]
*  Was it a strategic failure or was it a skill disparity? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2902.72s)]
*  I thought it was a [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2904.72s)]
*  It looked like age caught up a little [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2908.72s)]
*  And you can mitigate age a little bit [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2910.72s)]
*  By really training and really strategizing [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2912.72s)]
*  Mitigate it a little bit [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2914.72s)]
*  But it felt like he was going out there [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2916.72s)]
*  Doing what he's done [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2918.72s)]
*  For the last 30 years [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2920.72s)]
*  Probably boxing since he was 6 [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2922.72s)]
*  But he was just a little slower [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2924.72s)]
*  And he was going up against a guy who's also his age [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2926.72s)]
*  That just hadn't really slowed [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2928.72s)]
*  Less miles for Ingana? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2930.72s)]
*  For Usyk [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2932.72s)]
*  I guess Ingana too [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2934.72s)]
*  It just felt like [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2936.72s)]
*  And keep in mind Usyk's been in there with guys [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2938.72s)]
*  And gotten hit [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2940.72s)]
*  Like Usyk was fighting at what? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2942.72s)]
*  Cruiserweight before? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2944.72s)]
*  So it's not like he was going against slow plotting [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2946.72s)]
*  He was going against guys who were fucking crack [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2948.72s)]
*  It's just kind of like a weird division [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2950.72s)]
*  But it just felt like he had slowed down [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2952.72s)]
*  A little bit and in boxing you always see these guys [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2954.72s)]
*  When they slow down [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2956.72s)]
*  A tiny bit [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2958.72s)]
*  Especially guys who were [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2960.72s)]
*  Evading punches with great head movement [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2962.72s)]
*  And Tyson was one of those guys [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2964.72s)]
*  He's 6'9 or whatever but he can move his head [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2966.72s)]
*  Second it takes a little bit longer [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2968.72s)]
*  And you die [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2970.72s)]
*  Our whole life we've been told about [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2972.72s)]
*  Size advantage [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2974.72s)]
*  But we've never really seen size being an advantage [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2976.72s)]
*  We've seen it be a disadvantage [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2978.72s)]
*  And so many times in the sport [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2980.72s)]
*  We see the guy move up [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2982.72s)]
*  Muhammad Ali in his prime at heavy was 198 pounds [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2984.72s)]
*  Mike Tyson in his prime was 220 pounds [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2986.72s)]
*  Mike literally never had a longer arm [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2988.72s)]
*  They talk about reach of it [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2990.72s)]
*  Never had a longer arm or a pound on an opponent [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2992.72s)]
*  Just for example [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2994.72s)]
*  And even Roy's dad didn't want it to happen [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2996.72s)]
*  I remember what he said [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=2998.72s)]
*  I do not want my son to do this [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3000.72s)]
*  Roy beat him every which way [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3002.72s)]
*  And then [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3004.72s)]
*  Evander Holyfield was a smaller guy [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3006.72s)]
*  And he moved up [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3008.72s)]
*  And I'm always sharing with you like these cruiserweights really do learn how to fight [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3010.72s)]
*  And really learn how to move [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3012.72s)]
*  And I just felt like Usyk [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3014.72s)]
*  He doesn't have the body for it [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3016.72s)]
*  I completely misjudged him I made fun of his voice [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3018.72s)]
*  There was a lot of things where I didn't really see it [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3020.72s)]
*  And I go man that guy what a fighter [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3022.72s)]
*  He got cracked [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3024.72s)]
*  It was a hard match and he found a way [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3026.72s)]
*  He got a big uppercut [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3028.72s)]
*  From like Fury caught him going in [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3030.72s)]
*  Because he fights in that [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3032.72s)]
*  Traditional Russian style [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3034.72s)]
*  You know where they [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3036.72s)]
*  Soviets I don't know what the fuck you would call it [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3038.72s)]
*  But there's just this a lot of [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3040.72s)]
*  Side to side head movement [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3042.72s)]
*  But Fury tied him caught him with this uppercut [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3044.72s)]
*  He stepped back and you can even hear him go [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3046.72s)]
*  Oof [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3048.72s)]
*  Never a great sound from a guy [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3050.72s)]
*  But he was able to hold it in [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3052.72s)]
*  And Fury didn't go after him after that [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3054.72s)]
*  I thought he didn't know that he hurt him [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3056.72s)]
*  Or he was like tired and just [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3058.72s)]
*  Maybe he was being more methodical [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3060.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3062.72s)]
*  He had him stunned [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3064.72s)]
*  If he would have kept on him [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3066.72s)]
*  He could have put the pressure on him [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3068.72s)]
*  And he says he wants the rematch by the way [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3070.72s)]
*  They signed it up I thought [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3072.72s)]
*  Oh they've already signed it [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3074.72s)]
*  I saw a flyer [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3076.72s)]
*  He had the rematch clause but they have those all the time [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3078.72s)]
*  They don't activate them [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3080.72s)]
*  In fight sports I notice this a lot [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3082.72s)]
*  There's always one ref that seems blind [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3084.72s)]
*  Like the way they score [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3086.72s)]
*  The way they score it is just [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3088.72s)]
*  So completely awkward [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3090.72s)]
*  Why do you think that happens? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3092.72s)]
*  Well I do not know [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3094.72s)]
*  Why that happens I will tell you my bigger [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3096.72s)]
*  Frustration is why when that happens [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3098.72s)]
*  There is never a discussion [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3100.72s)]
*  There is never a meeting like if a fighter does [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3102.72s)]
*  Anything we get licensed by the same [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3104.72s)]
*  Body the administrators [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3106.72s)]
*  Their licenses by the same body [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3108.72s)]
*  We get called in [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3110.72s)]
*  We got to get lawyers and defend ourselves [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3112.72s)]
*  And we got to explain and the commission is generally [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3114.72s)]
*  Pretty open to hearing you the commission is generally [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3116.72s)]
*  Pretty nice to fighters but [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3118.72s)]
*  They still make them go through the process [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3120.72s)]
*  Why would you not bring a judge in and say [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3122.72s)]
*  You know every judge had this unanimous [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3124.72s)]
*  You had it vastly different [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3126.72s)]
*  Can we look at round 3 [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3128.72s)]
*  For example what is it that you saw [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3130.72s)]
*  And if that judge has an answer [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3132.72s)]
*  I think we could all learn something and we could also live with it [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3134.72s)]
*  The mere fact that they are never questioned [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3136.72s)]
*  A fighter has to come in publicly [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3138.72s)]
*  Can have his whole career [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3140.72s)]
*  But a judge when you are getting a license [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3142.72s)]
*  From the same person I know I keep repeating that [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3144.72s)]
*  But it is very relevant the attorney general [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3146.72s)]
*  Is the one giving everybody their license [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3148.72s)]
*  It seems as though you treated it the same [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3150.72s)]
*  There is a fighter that came in and [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3152.72s)]
*  Gave an absolutely horrible performance [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3154.72s)]
*  Let's just say like awful [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3156.72s)]
*  Couldn't keep their hands up looked like slow and blotting [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3158.72s)]
*  I would imagine that at least [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3160.72s)]
*  The promotion would do an investigation on them [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3162.72s)]
*  And be like hey are you okay [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3164.72s)]
*  You weren't performing like you usually perform [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3166.72s)]
*  Is there something wrong? Are you unhealthy? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3168.72s)]
*  Did the weight drain affect you? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3170.72s)]
*  There is not even any of that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3172.72s)]
*  With the judges [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3174.72s)]
*  When you have the fighter that won [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3176.72s)]
*  Saying I did not [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3178.72s)]
*  I mean when that happens I think you have a real problem on it [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3180.72s)]
*  I will give you a great example [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3182.72s)]
*  What they were getting ready to do in Nevada [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3184.72s)]
*  And it took no investigation [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3186.72s)]
*  Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3188.72s)]
*  Floyd there was 9 seconds left [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3190.72s)]
*  In the first round when he took a hand [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3192.72s)]
*  And moved it in a forward direction [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3194.72s)]
*  Gave the round away but then he kept giving rounds away [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3196.72s)]
*  And he explained it later I was feeling him out [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3198.72s)]
*  I was tying him out I had a strategy [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3200.72s)]
*  So therefore I gave the rounds away [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3202.72s)]
*  Well not according to the judges [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3204.72s)]
*  According to the judges you won them all [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3206.72s)]
*  And those judges were getting ready to [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3208.72s)]
*  Rob Conor I watched that side by side [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3210.72s)]
*  With Teddy Atlas one of the most respected ones [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3212.72s)]
*  And Teddy had 4 rounds [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3214.72s)]
*  For McGregor when they were going [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3216.72s)]
*  Into the 10th which ended up being the final [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3218.72s)]
*  And everybody did some people had 5 [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3220.72s)]
*  For McGregor I'm just saying not the Nevada State [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3222.72s)]
*  Athletic Commission I mean they were getting too ready [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3224.72s)]
*  To rob McGregor and because [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3226.72s)]
*  It ended correctly with a TKO [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3228.72s)]
*  And we never got there we therefore [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3230.72s)]
*  Never went back and looked at those [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3232.72s)]
*  But they're still turned in those sheets are still turned [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3234.72s)]
*  There's still public information [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3236.72s)]
*  And on Bob Bennett's watch there was [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3238.72s)]
*  Nothing to see here folks [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3240.72s)]
*  Outrage because there's like so many people bet [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3242.72s)]
*  On combat sports like there should be so much out [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3244.72s)]
*  Like afterwards if you look at a tape [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3246.72s)]
*  Could you get an objective measure of what the scoring should have been? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3248.72s)]
*  Or is it still too nebulous [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3250.72s)]
*  Just based off the way fighting goes? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3252.72s)]
*  Is it like an AI system? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3254.72s)]
*  Like with baseball for example [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3256.72s)]
*  Miles and I were talking about this like umpires will get like awards [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3258.72s)]
*  And shit after like seasons [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3260.72s)]
*  Or after specific games if they have a perfect scoring [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3262.72s)]
*  Game they never missed a pitch every single pitch [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3264.72s)]
*  That they called was exactly what it was strike ball [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3266.72s)]
*  And I wonder if you could do the same thing [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3268.72s)]
*  So they do this with Olympic [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3270.72s)]
*  Boxing where they've [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3272.72s)]
*  Done two things they've tried to take like the brutality [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3274.72s)]
*  Out of the sport a little bit and made it more of like a point system [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3276.72s)]
*  Yeah and the problem is [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3278.72s)]
*  You get the same amount of points for hitting a guy [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3280.72s)]
*  Hard and soft [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3282.72s)]
*  And we know in judging [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3284.72s)]
*  Around hitting a guy [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3286.72s)]
*  Hard once is probably better [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3288.72s)]
*  Than hitting them soft 15 times [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3290.72s)]
*  Like if I crack you once [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3292.72s)]
*  Damn it so it's like [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3294.72s)]
*  It's a very hard thing to do with a point system [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3296.72s)]
*  But once you add the point system in [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3298.72s)]
*  It changes the way the fighters fight [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3300.72s)]
*  There are a lot of guys who are like Olympic [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3302.72s)]
*  Style fighters who are really good at that style [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3304.72s)]
*  And then they go into the pros [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3306.72s)]
*  And they don't have these [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3308.72s)]
*  Great careers [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3310.72s)]
*  They had Cubans at three time gold medals [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3312.72s)]
*  He is amazing [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3314.72s)]
*  And no he's not [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3316.72s)]
*  Might not even go into the pros [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3318.72s)]
*  Because that style doesn't transfer just to your point [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3320.72s)]
*  Yeah a lot of the Cuban guys they have this incredible [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3322.72s)]
*  I mean they're like some of the most beautiful [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3324.72s)]
*  Boxers just the way that they move [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3326.72s)]
*  It's incredible but when they go in there [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3328.72s)]
*  With a tough [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3330.72s)]
*  In your face Mexican brawler [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3332.72s)]
*  Who's not going to let them [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3334.72s)]
*  Dance around and not going to care [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3336.72s)]
*  If he gets kicked with a couple little [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3338.72s)]
*  Paw jabs [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3340.72s)]
*  What if you put a device in the gloves [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3342.72s)]
*  That's what they do [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3344.72s)]
*  They've done it with some tech [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3346.72s)]
*  But what they do is [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3348.72s)]
*  They have like five judges and they count [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3350.72s)]
*  Punches [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3352.72s)]
*  And if three of them agree that it's a punch [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3354.72s)]
*  It's a punch [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3356.72s)]
*  Or three or more [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3358.72s)]
*  That's how they count [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3360.72s)]
*  If you actually had a machine in the gloves [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3362.72s)]
*  That it would be like oh this strike was this many [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3364.72s)]
*  But what happens if that hits the glove [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3366.72s)]
*  That was the problem they presented it [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3368.72s)]
*  And they feel like it's a foreign object [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3370.72s)]
*  Like we want to go with you but that's a foreign object [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3372.72s)]
*  What do we do about this [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3374.72s)]
*  But then if the two chips meet [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3376.72s)]
*  Then it doesn't count [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3378.72s)]
*  And then what happens if you have a malfunction [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3380.72s)]
*  Do you have to rewind it [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3382.72s)]
*  You might remember in Olympic gloves [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3384.72s)]
*  That part of it is white [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3386.72s)]
*  And that part must touch a certain part of the body [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3388.72s)]
*  And if it does it's a punch [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3390.72s)]
*  And so [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3392.72s)]
*  I mean just Andrew's point [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3394.72s)]
*  Like damage in the pros is number one [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3396.72s)]
*  But in the amateur it does not matter how hard or if it's just a flick [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3398.72s)]
*  If it touches you it's supposed to get a point [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3400.72s)]
*  Which can just confuse it [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3402.72s)]
*  Where sometimes that doesn't carry over [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3404.72s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't translate [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3406.72s)]
*  Sports with judges kind of bug me [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3408.72s)]
*  Like you know what I mean you watch gymnastics [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3410.72s)]
*  Or something like that or figure skating [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3412.72s)]
*  This is an awesome sport but the fact that it's so subjective [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3414.72s)]
*  It's bothersome [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3416.72s)]
*  Most unfair thing in the world [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3418.72s)]
*  And a lot of sports are subjective right like this calls in [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3420.72s)]
*  This calls out but like you see it like leaves someone's fingers [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3422.72s)]
*  The clock is still running and it goes in the hoop [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3424.72s)]
*  I think we watch sports for conquest [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3426.72s)]
*  And none more so than fighting [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3428.72s)]
*  So if you're taking the ultimate conquest sport [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3430.72s)]
*  And then you're putting judges in it [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3432.72s)]
*  Where it suddenly becomes a great area [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3434.72s)]
*  I think that's the most infuriating thing [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3436.72s)]
*  So subjective at the same time [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3438.72s)]
*  Somebody steals a joke does that make you mad [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3440.72s)]
*  They just tear your joke [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3442.72s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3444.72s)]
*  All we have is our IP [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3446.72s)]
*  And I mean there's other things that make you a great comedian [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3448.72s)]
*  But the foundation of everything [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3450.72s)]
*  Is your brain coming up with that idea [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3452.72s)]
*  Writing that idea [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3454.72s)]
*  We don't like the ghost writing type shit [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3456.72s)]
*  With like rappers for me it's like [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3458.72s)]
*  How do you ever forgive that because [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3460.72s)]
*  To me the foundational aspect of a comedian [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3462.72s)]
*  Is his brain and his idea [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3464.72s)]
*  It's not yours [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3466.72s)]
*  That's unanimous I've never heard anybody [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3468.72s)]
*  Accept what you said so [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3470.72s)]
*  I will say there are times where [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3472.72s)]
*  Somebody might have an idea that you've had [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3474.72s)]
*  But they didn't steal it [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3476.72s)]
*  That is not [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3478.72s)]
*  I mean it's frustrating because you're like [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3480.72s)]
*  Damn man I worked on this joke for so long [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3482.72s)]
*  And then this guy kind of has something similar to it [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3484.72s)]
*  But when you know someone [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3486.72s)]
*  Like saw you and then they're going to do the joke [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3488.72s)]
*  That can be [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3490.72s)]
*  And we've all gotten sensitive [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3492.72s)]
*  And overreacted to somebody having [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3494.72s)]
*  And then you have to sit back and go you know what [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3496.72s)]
*  More than one person is going to have this idea [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3498.72s)]
*  What about you though like you must get inspired [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3500.72s)]
*  By somebody [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3502.72s)]
*  So then does that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3504.72s)]
*  Is your inspiration like what's the rule there [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3506.72s)]
*  What is the rule there where it's an idea [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3508.72s)]
*  But it's not the same words I'm just wondering [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3510.72s)]
*  I mean everybody can joke around about Trump [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3512.72s)]
*  Somebody saying something about Trump [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3514.72s)]
*  Doesn't mean it's like their [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3516.72s)]
*  Their thing you know what I mean you can do a Trump [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3518.72s)]
*  Impression and there can be someone else who does a Trump [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3520.72s)]
*  Impression that doesn't mean there's like stealing [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3522.72s)]
*  But I think it's different with like [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3524.72s)]
*  If you're talking about a specific thing about your life [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3526.72s)]
*  Yeah, and jokes have also pieces [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3528.72s)]
*  You have like set up punchline tags [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3530.72s)]
*  And then multiple set up punchline tags will make a chunk [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3532.72s)]
*  And if someone has a different [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3534.72s)]
*  You know set up [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3536.72s)]
*  But maybe a similar kind of punchline you're like alright it might be a different joke [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3538.72s)]
*  Or if it's a similar set up and different punchlines [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3540.72s)]
*  You're like alright it's a different joke [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3542.72s)]
*  So you can hear someone do a set up and be like oh I might go someplace different with this [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3544.72s)]
*  Marriage is hard [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3546.72s)]
*  A million different ways to go [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3548.72s)]
*  That's the theme though [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3550.72s)]
*  I was just like a [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3552.72s)]
*  Straight inspiration like in [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3554.72s)]
*  In fighting I never created a move [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3556.72s)]
*  I've stolen them all from somebody else [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3558.72s)]
*  I thought it was honorable [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3560.72s)]
*  As an analyst you have very unique takes [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3562.72s)]
*  Your takes make you great [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3564.72s)]
*  At this [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3566.72s)]
*  Now if you suddenly saw somebody [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3568.72s)]
*  Absolutely believe it and yeah [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3570.72s)]
*  If you saw somebody suddenly using your takes [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3572.72s)]
*  And getting notoriety [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3574.72s)]
*  You'd be driven fucking crazy like these are my [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3576.72s)]
*  That's what makes me great at this [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3578.72s)]
*  What if someone was out there calling themselves the bad guy [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3580.72s)]
*  The bad man ink [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3582.72s)]
*  Every week [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3584.72s)]
*  The same take you had just a couple hours later [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3586.72s)]
*  They saw this fighter feed a carrot to a minivan [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3588.72s)]
*  Or whatever [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3590.72s)]
*  The internet's going crazy [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3592.72s)]
*  Maybe he's not as handsome or not as strong but you know people still watch [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3594.72s)]
*  Maybe why he's not as hot [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3596.72s)]
*  But what if that happened [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3598.72s)]
*  And then I go [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3600.72s)]
*  Hey wait a minute that's my side [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3602.72s)]
*  And I go look at the guy and he's got like a homage paid to me on his twitter [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3604.72s)]
*  Like hey this is my favorite fighter and therefore I'm copying his ideas [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3606.72s)]
*  That does change things a bit [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3608.72s)]
*  Okay and what if [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3610.72s)]
*  What if you got this idea and you're like hey man it's basically what you said [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3612.72s)]
*  And I loved it I've changed it just a little bit [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3614.72s)]
*  What if you called the guy [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3616.72s)]
*  There's ways to do it that are like we talk it out [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3618.72s)]
*  A girl DM'd me recently and I have to watch the bit [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3620.72s)]
*  But she was like hey I put this vid up [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3622.72s)]
*  You have a similar joke and you're special [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3624.72s)]
*  Do you want me to take out the line [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3626.72s)]
*  There's one line that's exactly like your whatever I have to watch the bit [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3628.72s)]
*  But it's like oh I respect off rip [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3630.72s)]
*  That she hit me up and out of that respect [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3632.72s)]
*  I might say just leave it up dude I appreciate you reaching out [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3634.72s)]
*  I have to watch the thing [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3636.72s)]
*  I used it on these [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3638.72s)]
*  Joke one time [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3640.72s)]
*  But to pay a respect [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3642.72s)]
*  I love it [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3644.72s)]
*  It was so funny I watched all of his stuff [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3646.72s)]
*  He was with this girl and the girl was like [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3648.72s)]
*  Oh man I love that line [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3650.72s)]
*  It's like we teleported to something and he's like and by the way [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3652.72s)]
*  Teleportation doesn't exist yet you must be kind of stupid [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3654.72s)]
*  A real simple joke [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3656.72s)]
*  But I loved it oh my god that is so funny [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3658.72s)]
*  You know it's just as great [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3660.72s)]
*  And it's something to do with bed sheets and something else [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3662.72s)]
*  But I did that with the teleportation [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3664.72s)]
*  And it did get to him [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3666.72s)]
*  And he did respond to it and he did not like [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3668.72s)]
*  He did not take it as a [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3670.72s)]
*  Nice thing [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3672.72s)]
*  But I also didn't have an ability to tell him [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3674.72s)]
*  I didn't have an ability to go oh no wait a minute [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3676.72s)]
*  I ripped that off I admit I ripped that off [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3678.72s)]
*  But I was trying to pay respect for you [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3680.72s)]
*  You were kind of up and coming and I watched all of your stuff [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3682.72s)]
*  It's a great bit [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3684.72s)]
*  Did you say it while you were saying the joke? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3686.72s)]
*  I did the joke [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3688.72s)]
*  I took it was a little bit different words but I used the [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3690.72s)]
*  Teleportation hasn't been invented yet [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3692.72s)]
*  You must be kind of stupid I used the punch line [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3694.72s)]
*  And I would have paid it off [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3696.72s)]
*  But he wasn't really known yet [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3698.72s)]
*  I had discovered it [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3700.72s)]
*  So when I had the opportunity [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3702.72s)]
*  What a great way to make friends with the god [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3704.72s)]
*  You were helping [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3706.72s)]
*  If you caught a Z's [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3708.72s)]
*  Massive a Z's friends with Connie friends with Jay Z [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3710.72s)]
*  He might not care as much but when it's like [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3712.72s)]
*  I'm trying to make it in this business [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3714.72s)]
*  I have nothing right now [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3716.72s)]
*  And you're getting notoriety for this thing that's mine [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3718.72s)]
*  And people are going to think it's yours if I do it [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3720.72s)]
*  Quite possibly [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3722.72s)]
*  That would change things [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3724.72s)]
*  So it's all [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3726.72s)]
*  You got to look at the actual situation [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3728.72s)]
*  Who do you think takes your stuff when it comes to [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3730.72s)]
*  Analysis of the fight game [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3732.72s)]
*  Who's influenced by you? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3734.72s)]
*  Who do you hate? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3736.72s)]
*  Let's start some beef [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3738.72s)]
*  I've always taken it as a [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3740.72s)]
*  Compliment [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3742.72s)]
*  Who's the worst at the fight game? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3744.72s)]
*  In terms of an analysis? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3746.72s)]
*  Who's just the worst? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3748.72s)]
*  Oh my goodness the worst [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3750.72s)]
*  I've seen some very bad reviews out there [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3752.72s)]
*  And if I was to be real fair on who the worst was [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3754.72s)]
*  It's a drunk guy [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3756.72s)]
*  He gets drunk during the show [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3758.72s)]
*  He's got grey hair and he's in boxing [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3760.72s)]
*  And he just simply should not be there [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3762.72s)]
*  I want to call him Harold Letterman [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3764.72s)]
*  But I don't know if that's right and I don't want to do that to Harold [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3766.72s)]
*  Whoever this guy was [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3768.72s)]
*  He was interviewing Floyd one day and said [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3770.72s)]
*  If I was 30 years young great [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3772.72s)]
*  No that's not Harold Letterman [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3774.72s)]
*  Is that Jim Lampley? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3776.72s)]
*  No no no [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3778.72s)]
*  I can't believe I'm forgetting this [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3780.72s)]
*  Oh god god god [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3782.72s)]
*  Jim got drunk into some [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3784.72s)]
*  Beat a woman thing and he was innocent [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3786.72s)]
*  And he kept his mouth [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3788.72s)]
*  I don't know Jim Lampley but I'm going to tell you this one thing about people that know him [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3790.72s)]
*  Say he's such an honorable guy [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3792.72s)]
*  It was like an ex-wife did something to him [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3794.72s)]
*  Turned out to be totally untrue and be cutting it [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3796.72s)]
*  And he to this day took it on the chin [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3798.72s)]
*  And it was not true [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3800.72s)]
*  They kicked him off of HBO [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3802.72s)]
*  I remember that coming out [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3804.72s)]
*  He still never told him about it [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3806.72s)]
*  He's never defeated himself and neither has anybody [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3808.72s)]
*  So what is he doing? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3810.72s)]
*  He's been boxing [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3812.72s)]
*  Larry Merchant [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3814.72s)]
*  Thank you see Harold Letterman [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3816.72s)]
*  Harold Letterman is a fun guy [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3818.72s)]
*  Actually he comes in and gives the scores between rounds [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3820.72s)]
*  I've got it six rounds so four [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3822.72s)]
*  Larry Merchant simply doesn't know [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3824.72s)]
*  He simply does not know [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3826.72s)]
*  What he's talking about [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3828.72s)]
*  Larry Merchant [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3830.72s)]
*  But he does have a presence [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3832.72s)]
*  You're beefing with a 93 right? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3834.72s)]
*  You didn't like when he said the Floyd [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3836.72s)]
*  I didn't like that he did that [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3838.72s)]
*  If I was 30 years younger I would have whooped your ass [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3840.72s)]
*  That would have been enough [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3842.72s)]
*  It would have been 60 [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3844.72s)]
*  10 years ago whatever [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3846.72s)]
*  Jim Gray made his comeuppance by [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3848.72s)]
*  By asking athletes hard questions in the moment [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3850.72s)]
*  Pete Rose and some other things that come to mind [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3852.72s)]
*  And I have a real problem with that [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3854.72s)]
*  Because there was a trust [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3856.72s)]
*  They had an absolute trust [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3858.72s)]
*  And agreed to the interview [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3860.72s)]
*  And everything's cool in the gang [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3862.72s)]
*  The camera goes on [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3864.72s)]
*  He pulls the double cross to put himself over [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3866.72s)]
*  And I have a problem with that [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3868.72s)]
*  If you light up the interview go ahead [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3870.72s)]
*  If you're working for ESPN and they light up the interview [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3872.72s)]
*  So you're not getting burned [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3874.72s)]
*  You're not burning your Rolodex [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3876.72s)]
*  You're burning them [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3878.72s)]
*  I thought it was underhanded [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3880.72s)]
*  Jim Gray always seemed annoying [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3882.72s)]
*  That is an interesting take [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3884.72s)]
*  He did that to Pete Rose [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3886.72s)]
*  He agrees to this interview and he turns it right into the gambling [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3888.72s)]
*  Why couldn't you just say this Pete [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3890.72s)]
*  You're sorry [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3892.72s)]
*  Pete's kind of caught off guard [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3894.72s)]
*  Whether he had an answer to that or not [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3896.72s)]
*  That wasn't what this interview was about [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3898.72s)]
*  They were supposed to just get this baseball [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3900.72s)]
*  I'm just saying that has always bothered me [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3902.72s)]
*  That Jim has done and then taken a pride in it [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3904.72s)]
*  It's a strange thing [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3906.72s)]
*  I think I've heard not great things about Jim as well [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3908.72s)]
*  Just like behind the camera [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3910.72s)]
*  I mean it's a cutthroat business [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3912.72s)]
*  He's done some stuff [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3914.72s)]
*  But that is an interesting thing [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3916.72s)]
*  This person has trained 8 weeks [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3918.72s)]
*  For this fight [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3920.72s)]
*  Minimum, maybe 10 weeks [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3922.72s)]
*  Maybe they've trained their entire life for this title match [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3924.72s)]
*  They win [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3926.72s)]
*  Brain damage probably [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3928.72s)]
*  They win and then they're in their moment [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3930.72s)]
*  Of peak celebration [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3932.72s)]
*  And then he asks you this question [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3934.72s)]
*  That's like this hard hitting almost gotcha [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3936.72s)]
*  Yeah I can see that as being [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3938.72s)]
*  Kind of fucked up [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3940.72s)]
*  It is, I really think it is in that moment [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3942.72s)]
*  And then intent matters too [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3944.72s)]
*  I could be reading Jim wrong but it sure appears to me [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3946.72s)]
*  That he's asking those questions [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3948.72s)]
*  And they are designed to make him look [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3950.72s)]
*  Like the tough question [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3952.72s)]
*  The challenging [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3954.72s)]
*  There's a cool moment in the Dana Lex Freeman podcast [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3956.72s)]
*  Where he brings up that exact Larry Merchant moment [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3958.72s)]
*  And he's like [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3960.72s)]
*  I make sure the UFC commentators will never do [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3962.72s)]
*  Any shit like that ever [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3964.72s)]
*  Dana has even taken heat [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3966.72s)]
*  I think it's leadership when he does it [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3968.72s)]
*  But he won't tell guys what they can't say to press conference [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3970.72s)]
*  If you want to look bad [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3972.72s)]
*  But I'm not going to tell you what to say [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3974.72s)]
*  Yeah but that's because [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3976.72s)]
*  If he tells them what not to say [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3978.72s)]
*  He's telling them what to say [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3980.72s)]
*  And now you have a scripted promo [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3982.72s)]
*  Now you're in the WWE [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3984.72s)]
*  It's the same thing [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3986.72s)]
*  And it really is [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3988.72s)]
*  A bit of a leap by me but [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3990.72s)]
*  By telling people what not to say [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3992.72s)]
*  You are telling them what to say [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3994.72s)]
*  And he's just not touching that [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3996.72s)]
*  And that is not a political thing like people try to make it [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=3998.72s)]
*  It's not a mean thing or even a fight promotion thing [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4000.72s)]
*  It's authentic and this is what it is [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4002.72s)]
*  Don't bring your ideas in your flat [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4004.72s)]
*  Or anything [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4006.72s)]
*  Their reward system like the UFC reward system is quite brilliant [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4008.72s)]
*  They give financial rewards [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4010.72s)]
*  To the type of fights [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4012.72s)]
*  That they like [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4014.72s)]
*  That doesn't really exist in boxing [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4016.72s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4018.72s)]
*  It's just get the win by any means necessary [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4020.72s)]
*  But the UFC is like [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4022.72s)]
*  Even if you lose exciting [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4024.72s)]
*  You're going to be back [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4026.72s)]
*  And you're going to get a fight of the night bonus [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4028.72s)]
*  For losing exciting [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4030.72s)]
*  And then they reward you for winning exciting fashion [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4032.72s)]
*  And then also the people [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4034.72s)]
*  That they end up giving fights to and continue [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4036.72s)]
*  Promoting [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4038.72s)]
*  Lead themselves in a certain way [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4040.72s)]
*  So the other fighters don't need you to tell them what to do [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4042.72s)]
*  Just watch [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4044.72s)]
*  Look at the people you admire [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4046.72s)]
*  Look at how they dress, look at how they talk [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4048.72s)]
*  Look at the promos they're cutting, what are they doing on their own social media [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4050.72s)]
*  Who are they meeting up with, what podcasts are they going on [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4052.72s)]
*  It's so interesting [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4054.72s)]
*  You don't really need to [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4056.72s)]
*  Tell people to behave in any way [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4058.72s)]
*  Just reward the behavior [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4060.72s)]
*  That you like [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4062.72s)]
*  That's really clever [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4064.72s)]
*  That's exactly right [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4066.72s)]
*  Do you want to know a ticket [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4068.72s)]
*  I'm switching out to politics [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4070.72s)]
*  But do you want to know a ticket that I think would be hard to beat [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4072.72s)]
*  Talk to me [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4074.72s)]
*  Trump, Dana White [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4076.72s)]
*  I've never seen anybody [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4078.72s)]
*  Where they've tried to get you in gotcha moments [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4080.72s)]
*  And there's nothing like Dana White [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4082.72s)]
*  Who's president and who's VP [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4084.72s)]
*  Trump would be one and Dana would [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4086.72s)]
*  And that would be [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4088.72s)]
*  I think Dana would be [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4090.72s)]
*  He might be willing to be their homies [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4092.72s)]
*  There's about two people in the world that he would [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4094.72s)]
*  Admit that he, and Trump just happens to be one of them [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4096.719999999999s)]
*  Who's the other one [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4098.719999999999s)]
*  The other one is Frank Fertina who died [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4100.719999999999s)]
*  Senior, he also liked Frank [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4102.719999999999s)]
*  The son, but Dana would have [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4104.719999999999s)]
*  Done what Frank Senior told him to do [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4106.719999999999s)]
*  He has a lot of respect for him [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4108.719999999999s)]
*  Would show a lot of respect to Trump [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4110.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4112.719999999999s)]
*  What is, I'm trying to think, what about that ticket [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4114.719999999999s)]
*  And Dana also sees [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4116.72s)]
*  He and Trump as really good friends [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4118.72s)]
*  And I believe Trump sees [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4120.72s)]
*  Dana more as like a son [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4122.72s)]
*  Trump was very proud [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4124.72s)]
*  Of Dana [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4126.72s)]
*  That's not a word you could have used very often [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4128.72s)]
*  He was actually proud of Dana [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4130.72s)]
*  For standing his ground, for coming up, for making this company [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4132.72s)]
*  And would stay in touch with him [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4134.72s)]
*  He would write Dana a letter here [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4136.72s)]
*  Dana made the front page of an article [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4138.72s)]
*  And Trump took this way back [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4140.72s)]
*  He gave him a fight [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4142.72s)]
*  Before UFC was big and they couldn't really get sanctions fights [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4144.72s)]
*  Yeah, at the Taj Mahal [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4146.72s)]
*  Decade, 10, 15, 20 years ago [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4148.72s)]
*  All 6 hours, and the Trump kids do that same damn thing [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4150.72s)]
*  I don't know what that is [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4152.72s)]
*  I don't know if that's political or what, but when they go to an event [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4154.72s)]
*  Everybody comes in right at the last minute, particularly the famous people [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4156.72s)]
*  The Trumps, and this includes the kids [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4158.72s)]
*  Come for the first fight [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4160.72s)]
*  And they do not leave [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4162.72s)]
*  Six and a half hours, and they do it all the time [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4164.72s)]
*  I would absolutely come to the main event [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4166.72s)]
*  Donald Trump came to the NCAA wrestling [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4168.72s)]
*  Last year, I don't know what level of fan [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4170.72s)]
*  And he came to the whole goddamn thing [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4172.72s)]
*  And he did not even look like he wanted to leave [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4174.72s)]
*  It was just a nice thing to do, quite frankly [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4176.72s)]
*  He got no press for that [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4178.72s)]
*  Nobody even knew that he went there, the wrestlers [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4180.72s)]
*  And I don't know what that is [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4182.72s)]
*  I don't know if that's just a politeness or a fan [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4184.72s)]
*  I'm just sharing that he does it when he comes to football games [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4186.72s)]
*  When he does not leave [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4188.72s)]
*  He stays until there's some etiquette [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4190.72s)]
*  Yeah, UFC really locked in [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4192.72s)]
*  Which is, if you go to boxing matches [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4194.72s)]
*  And I'm a boxing guy [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4196.72s)]
*  I come from like boxing background [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4198.72s)]
*  But if you go to boxing matches [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4200.72s)]
*  That place is empty until the headlining fight [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4202.72s)]
*  UFC, you will go there [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4206.72s)]
*  I try to get to every UFC event that I go to [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4208.72s)]
*  For the entire main event [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4210.72s)]
*  Which is what, maybe like six cards sometimes [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4212.72s)]
*  Six fights [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4214.72s)]
*  How many is the... [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4216.72s)]
*  The main card is five [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4218.72s)]
*  And then maybe three or four of the prelims [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4220.72s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to get there [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4222.72s)]
*  That place is packed when I walk in [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4224.72s)]
*  Every single time [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4226.72s)]
*  Packed [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4228.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4230.72s)]
*  And I think it goes to unpredictability [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4232.72s)]
*  It's the same thing we're talking about with the star power [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4236.72s)]
*  Any UFC fight [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4238.72s)]
*  Could go any different way [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4240.72s)]
*  And even if I don't know the guy's fucking names [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4242.72s)]
*  It could go any way [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4244.72s)]
*  You know on those prelims in a boxing card [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4246.72s)]
*  That there's a tomato can [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4248.72s)]
*  Versus a rising star [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4250.72s)]
*  Every single one of them is supposed to go one way [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4252.72s)]
*  And it's going to be an absolute dominant performance [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4254.72s)]
*  So why do I even need to watch this shit? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4256.72s)]
*  I don't need to see a guy that I don't even know dominate some tomato can [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4258.72s)]
*  Also boxing, only like [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4260.72s)]
*  Two things can happen [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4262.72s)]
*  Three things [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4264.72s)]
*  It's either a knockout, it's either a TKO, it's either a decision [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4266.72s)]
*  Or like it's like [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4268.72s)]
*  That's basically it, right? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4270.72s)]
*  Whereas with, I don't know, like UFC or MMA [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4272.72s)]
*  Or anything else, you can have so many different ways [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4274.72s)]
*  That it could end [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4276.72s)]
*  Do you feel safer boxing? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4278.72s)]
*  Well, it's very [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4280.72s)]
*  Kind of interesting, right? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4282.72s)]
*  Yeah, the gloves are bigger in some degree [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4284.72s)]
*  On the other side, you're only allowed to bludgeon [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4286.72s)]
*  There's nothing else that will happen [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4288.72s)]
*  So even if maybe they're not as hard [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4290.72s)]
*  Or at least in theory [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4292.72s)]
*  At least in theory there would be more padding [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4294.72s)]
*  There's sure going to be a lot more of them [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4296.72s)]
*  That's the only thing that there's going to be [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4298.72s)]
*  Yes, what is the answer to your question? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4300.72s)]
*  You do, right? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4302.72s)]
*  Like I do even in practice, but as I break it down on my head [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4304.72s)]
*  I think I should have a little bit more of a fear [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4306.72s)]
*  You should, but you're not going to get elbowed in your fucking head [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4308.72s)]
*  And cut your thing over [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4310.72s)]
*  Or if you go down, he's not jumping on top of you [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4312.72s)]
*  You know, give me just a second [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4314.72s)]
*  To configure [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4316.72s)]
*  So what is the most painful thing you've ever felt in your fight career? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4318.72s)]
*  Oh man [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4320.72s)]
*  I had [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4322.72s)]
*  And it's still out to this day [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4324.72s)]
*  I had a rib that came out [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4326.72s)]
*  And one of the more painful [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4328.72s)]
*  It hurt very bad [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4330.72s)]
*  But being at the doctor's, I remember the doctor said [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4332.72s)]
*  There's no way to reset it, there's no cast we can put it in [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4334.72s)]
*  And he said it's going to continue to hurt [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4336.72s)]
*  Until your nerve endings rub on each other [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4338.72s)]
*  And I did like that statement is what hurt [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4340.72s)]
*  Like I was in the doctor [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4342.72s)]
*  Fuck me [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4344.72s)]
*  You can't breathe [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4346.72s)]
*  When the rib is out [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4348.72s)]
*  And a guy landed on me [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4350.72s)]
*  I was in, I was wrestling for the Pac-10 championship [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4352.72s)]
*  Against a guy named Rusty Cook [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4354.72s)]
*  And we went to the mat when we went down [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4356.72s)]
*  It went out, right at the beginning of the match [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4358.72s)]
*  I got him on his back [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4360.72s)]
*  If I could have pinned him [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4362.72s)]
*  It wouldn't have mattered, but I didn't pin him [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4364.72s)]
*  He and Rusty Cook was tougher than hell [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4366.72s)]
*  I wonder sometimes what he is doing these days [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4368.72s)]
*  But at any rate [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4370.72s)]
*  That hurt really bad [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4372.72s)]
*  And then a broken nose [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4374.72s)]
*  Hurt really bad [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4376.72s)]
*  Broke my nose in practice [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4378.72s)]
*  Seth Roy, my teammate [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4380.72s)]
*  Threw a punch and his elbow came through [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4382.72s)]
*  But when they reset it by the way [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4384.72s)]
*  It hasn't gotten any better than when our grandparents [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4386.72s)]
*  Did this, they put two rods up your nose [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4388.72s)]
*  And they start [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4390.72s)]
*  Chopsticks with their metal [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4392.72s)]
*  And they start twisting them, oh my goodness [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4394.72s)]
*  That hurts [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4396.72s)]
*  When they reset it, oh they shove the [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4398.72s)]
*  This is a question I just had [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4400.72s)]
*  Based on something you said [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4402.72s)]
*  The part that's hardest for me to watch with [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4404.72s)]
*  UFC is when the guy is out [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4406.72s)]
*  And what you brought up, the guy gets on top of him [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4408.72s)]
*  And you have to knock out a guy [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4410.72s)]
*  That's already unconscious, most likely to win [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4412.72s)]
*  Is there any chance [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4414.72s)]
*  You think there's like a count that UFC goes to [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4416.72s)]
*  Where it's like you got 5 seconds or 6 seconds or whatever [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4418.72s)]
*  Maybe not 10, 7 seconds if you're down on the ground [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4420.72s)]
*  To get up or whatever [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4422.72s)]
*  That seems [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4424.72s)]
*  Well they sure could if there was any kind of a safety [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4426.72s)]
*  I fully agree with you [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4428.72s)]
*  Those referees are so good [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4430.72s)]
*  So fat [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4432.72s)]
*  There's no way you can jump in there [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4434.72s)]
*  I was so happy that Izzy beat Pereira [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4436.72s)]
*  But that punch when he's on the ground, unnecessary [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4438.72s)]
*  The knockout, I was thrilled [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4440.72s)]
*  This was just like in general [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4442.72s)]
*  If they're not clearly out [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4444.72s)]
*  They could be taken guard and you don't really know [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4446.72s)]
*  Did Dan Henderson bisp in one? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4448.72s)]
*  Is that the only thing? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4450.72s)]
*  You have to do it to win [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4452.72s)]
*  It was fair and square [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4454.72s)]
*  I mean the ref hadn't stepped in [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4456.72s)]
*  I think there's [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4458.72s)]
*  I've seen guys pull back [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4460.72s)]
*  For sure, and I've also seen guys pull back [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4462.72s)]
*  And then by the way [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4464.72s)]
*  Not get the finish to your point [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4466.72s)]
*  And they go, oh no [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4468.72s)]
*  There was a fight recently [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4470.72s)]
*  Moikano [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4472.72s)]
*  Moikano Jalen Turner [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4474.72s)]
*  Yes, turning it to Turner, thought he dropped him [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4476.72s)]
*  It was going to be game over [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4478.72s)]
*  Moikano ends up winning the fight [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4480.72s)]
*  Turner walked away [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4482.72s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, if there's a count [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4484.72s)]
*  Or something that's in place where it's like this is the rule [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4486.72s)]
*  This is going to piss off a lot of UFC fans [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4488.72s)]
*  I admit I'm a big pussy [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4490.72s)]
*  I just don't like seeing that [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4492.72s)]
*  Because you're watching most likely extra brain damage for no reason [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4494.72s)]
*  That is a great point by you, I think it's very fair [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4496.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's just rare [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4498.72s)]
*  I would say it's so rare [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4500.72s)]
*  And also when you're in the heat of the moment, like a lot of times this happens [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4502.72s)]
*  You're probably talking about a standing knockout [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4504.72s)]
*  Into a drop [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4506.72s)]
*  I mean, Stoutbender and Pereira [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4508.72s)]
*  The fight that's coming to my mind [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4510.72s)]
*  Pereira's out [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4512.72s)]
*  And Izzy has to to win [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4514.72s)]
*  I remember Joe Rogan called it a hammer fist from the gods [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4516.72s)]
*  But like this guy's unconscious and you have to [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4518.72s)]
*  Sure [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4520.72s)]
*  If you wanted for a real answer, like the only way they would change something [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4522.72s)]
*  If there was like some data [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4524.72s)]
*  From a medical perspective [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4526.72s)]
*  And it's actually been the opposite on that [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4528.72s)]
*  Now they are comparing themselves to boxing [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4530.72s)]
*  Which is the most dangerous [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4532.72s)]
*  Micro concussions, like offensive linemen in the NFL [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4534.72s)]
*  And they've actually proven that bringing those guys up [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4536.72s)]
*  And sending them back out there [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4538.72s)]
*  As opposed to letting that finish [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4540.72s)]
*  And it comes to a conclusion [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4542.72s)]
*  So I'm gonna guess not [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4544.72s)]
*  But I mean, you make a fair point, if it became a habit, they would do something [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4546.72s)]
*  What happens in boxing, right [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4548.72s)]
*  Is you get that huge shot that makes you [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4550.72s)]
*  That concusses you, right [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4552.72s)]
*  And then they stand you back up if you can [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4554.72s)]
*  And then you get another huge shot [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4556.72s)]
*  Not even a hundred, another big one [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4558.72s)]
*  Oh yeah [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4560.72s)]
*  And then you're concussed again [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4562.72s)]
*  So with UFC, you're gonna get hit again while you're on the ground [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4564.72s)]
*  But ideally, it's not like that Henderson [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4566.72s)]
*  Biss pick thing [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4568.72s)]
*  Yeah, some of those were fucking [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4570.72s)]
*  Do you remember like ever crushing somebody's [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4572.72s)]
*  Nose [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4574.72s)]
*  Or like bones when you were hitting them [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4576.72s)]
*  Does that go through your brain when you're fighting at all [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4578.72s)]
*  No, not in fighting [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4580.72s)]
*  Where I felt it [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4582.72s)]
*  I did one time, again, go back to a wrestling match [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4584.72s)]
*  It was my own nose [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4586.72s)]
*  I did the technique [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4588.72s)]
*  It's called a belly back [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4590.72s)]
*  I was in my office, but his body came down [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4592.72s)]
*  It's a very unique sensation [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4594.72s)]
*  It's gross, it's really gross [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4596.72s)]
*  Like anybody that tells you they liked it or they enjoyed it [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4598.72s)]
*  It's weird, I took his soul [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4600.72s)]
*  I'll see him do it and go, okay, now that's an interview [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4602.72s)]

*  Alright guys, we're gonna take a break real quick [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4652.72s)]
*  Because we gotta talk about these bad boys [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4654.72s)]
*  Did you know that the flavored air category [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4656.72s)]
*  Is quickly becoming the leading alternative to vaping and smoking [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4658.72s)]
*  It is a whole new movement [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4660.72s)]
*  Toward better habits led by the sponsor of today's video [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4662.72s)]
*  Fume [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4664.72s)]
*  Flavored air is not like vaping [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4666.72s)]
*  If vapor was sugar filled soda [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4668.72s)]
*  Fume cores would be closer to like an herbal tea [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4670.72s)]
*  Meaning it's not bad for you at all [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4672.72s)]
*  And like an herbal tea, they apply a lot of [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4674.72s)]
*  Delicious flavors to choose from [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4676.72s)]
*  Like crisp mint, orange vanilla [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4678.72s)]
*  With flavored air, you can satisfy your oral fixation [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4680.72s)]
*  Through a passive diffusion system [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4682.72s)]
*  That utilizes no electronics [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4684.72s)]
*  No vapor, no combustion [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4686.72s)]
*  I don't even vape, but I love the fume [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4688.72s)]
*  I love the feel of it, it feels solid [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4690.72s)]
*  It also has this nice little, you hear that click [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4692.72s)]
*  It's nice when you're fidgeting [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4694.72s)]
*  It gives your hand something to do [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4696.72s)]
*  And there is no vapor, you can use it anywhere [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4698.72s)]
*  And most importantly, there's no nicotine, it's not addictive [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4700.72s)]
*  It also looks fucking cool, it's got a nice way to it [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4702.72s)]
*  It's a high quality design [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4704.72s)]
*  And it's got a little magnetic thing [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4706.72s)]
*  That you just throw it at and it clicks to it [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4708.72s)]
*  It's fantastic, you can adjust the airflow [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4710.72s)]
*  It's wonderful [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4712.72s)]

*  It's not UFC [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4734.72s)]
*  But they're MMA fights [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4736.72s)]
*  That have different kinds of [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4738.72s)]
*  Matchups [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4740.72s)]
*  Four on four, boys against girls [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4742.72s)]
*  Guys in a car [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4744.72s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu in a car is crazy [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4746.72s)]
*  Car Jiu-Jitsu [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4748.72s)]
*  It's like a fight, I don't know why they call it Jiu-Jitsu [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4750.72s)]
*  They fight [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4752.72s)]
*  And then the one that's crazy is there was a dude [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4754.72s)]
*  That fought two chicks [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4756.72s)]
*  And he's just this fat, pot bellied [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4758.72s)]
*  Look at this guy [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4760.72s)]
*  This is wild [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4762.72s)]
*  This is in Romania with their version of the UFC [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4764.72s)]
*  I don't even want to say UFC [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4766.72s)]
*  Because I don't know if they want to say it [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4768.72s)]
*  Yeah, MMA, their version of MMA [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4770.72s)]
*  And this guy [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4772.72s)]
*  Takes on two girls [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4774.72s)]
*  I don't know anything about who these people are [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4776.72s)]
*  Now you're first [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4778.72s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what you're thinking right now [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4780.72s)]
*  You're thinking over there, is this wrestling [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4782.72s)]
*  Is this stage [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4784.72s)]
*  And we've all asked ourselves this [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4786.72s)]
*  No, no, it's not [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4788.72s)]
*  This is crazy [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4790.72s)]
*  He goes up [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4792.72s)]
*  I don't even want to watch it [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4794.72s)]
*  He is trying to hurt [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4796.72s)]
*  How can a guy agree to do that [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4798.72s)]
*  What kind of a man would go in there and do that [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4800.72s)]
*  I think it's easier to convince him [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4802.72s)]
*  I think there's a lot of guys [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4804.72s)]
*  I think girls is the hard part [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4806.72s)]
*  You give him the head gear and the what not [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4808.72s)]
*  But what guy wants to go [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4810.72s)]
*  I don't know [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4812.72s)]
*  He wanted more, look at him [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4814.72s)]
*  It seems like you're preying upon [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4816.72s)]
*  Somebody that's [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4818.72s)]
*  Maybe not in a full capacity [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4820.72s)]
*  Which is a pretty slimy move [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4822.72s)]
*  Is this inevitable [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4824.72s)]
*  Is this like an indication [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4826.72s)]
*  Of the end of an empire [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4828.72s)]
*  What's happening here [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4830.72s)]
*  It's the opposite, they used to do stuff like this [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4832.72s)]
*  And then commissions stepped in [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4834.72s)]
*  And it was small, you couldn't get on TV with things like that [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4836.72s)]
*  But it was small shows [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4838.72s)]
*  Would do that [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4840.72s)]
*  Or a man against woman fight [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4842.72s)]
*  And then commissions kind of balled [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4844.72s)]
*  It was one of the absolute first things [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4846.72s)]
*  They stopped, there would be no such thing as a [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4848.72s)]
*  Two on one, you wouldn't even ask a commission [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4850.72s)]
*  It wouldn't be gender based [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4852.72s)]
*  But there would also not be man versus woman [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4854.72s)]
*  Or heavyweight, that guy was clearly heavyweight versus [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4856.72s)]
*  Some 35 pounders, I'm just sharing that [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4858.72s)]
*  No, I don't think this is the direction we're going [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4860.72s)]
*  It's very funny how history repeats itself [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4862.72s)]
*  This is where we started [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4864.72s)]
*  And came out of that [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4866.72s)]
*  At least civilized [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4868.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, here's the card [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4870.72s)]
*  The card, the jitsu thing, that's crazy [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4872.72s)]
*  Okay so, this is what I assume it is [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4874.72s)]
*  That's just roughhousing with your friend [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4876.72s)]
*  Is that how you do it? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4878.72s)]
*  Give me my phone back [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4880.72s)]
*  Come on [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4882.72s)]
*  I think this is what happens when [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4884.72s)]
*  When, like [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4886.72s)]
*  For example, comedy is huge [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4888.72s)]
*  Right now, so there's all these different [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4890.72s)]
*  Versions of comedy [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4892.72s)]
*  That are like comedy adjacent [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4894.72s)]
*  That can pop up [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4896.72s)]
*  And they can be popular [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4898.72s)]
*  To a certain extent as well [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4900.72s)]
*  And fighting I think is huge right now [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4902.72s)]
*  So these are other people trying to [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4904.72s)]
*  You know, drift off of fight [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4906.72s)]
*  That's what I assume [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4908.72s)]
*  Not grift, drift [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4910.72s)]
*  So it's like [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4912.72s)]
*  It can't be better, be different [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4914.72s)]
*  Exactly, but because there is a lust [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4916.72s)]
*  To see fight sports right now [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4918.72s)]
*  It's like, okay, well what can we do that's kind of like that [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4920.72s)]
*  If fighting was [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4922.72s)]
*  Way less popular [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4924.72s)]
*  The UFC is not as big as it is [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4926.72s)]
*  And these different things aren't out there [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4928.72s)]
*  I don't think you're seeing these iterations [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4930.72s)]
*  You're still trying to make kickboxing a thing [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4932.72s)]
*  You're still trying to make Muay Thai a thing [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4934.72s)]
*  But the fact that it's so massive [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4936.72s)]
*  I mean, like, even kickboxers are making money now [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4938.72s)]
*  Kickboxers weren't making money [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4940.72s)]
*  These Muay Thai guys, they weren't making money [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4942.72s)]
*  Andrew Tate [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4944.72s)]
*  We talked about that being three grand was his [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4946.72s)]
*  I think his biggest payday in the world champion [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4948.72s)]
*  I just wonder if the human brain gets so used to stimulus [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4950.72s)]
*  That you just need another version of it [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4952.72s)]
*  And someone will bring up kind of like a morally [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4954.72s)]
*  Reliable version of this, whether it's not men versus women [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4956.72s)]
*  Specifically, but like, if it's like [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4958.72s)]
*  Yeah, these two women want to fight in America [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4960.72s)]
*  And you can listen to them and they're like, I want to beat this guy up [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4962.72s)]
*  And it's somewhat of a level matchup [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4964.72s)]
*  Where it's like, you know, a flyweight dude and [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4966.72s)]
*  Two women [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4968.72s)]
*  We did it with the guy [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4970.72s)]
*  The wrestler's name was [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4972.72s)]
*  China [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4974.72s)]
*  China fought [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4976.72s)]
*  The pro wrestler China [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4978.72s)]
*  Yeah, the female [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4980.72s)]
*  She fought the husband of the lady [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4982.72s)]
*  That was like shot in Long Island or something [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4984.72s)]
*  Yes, she did [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4986.72s)]
*  Joey Bonafuco [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4988.72s)]
*  Great recall [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4990.72s)]
*  She fought Joey Bonafuco? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4992.72s)]
*  Didn't he get shot in the head or something like that? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4994.72s)]
*  No [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4996.72s)]
*  The mistress shot the wife [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=4998.72s)]
*  And Joey knew nothing about it [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5000.72s)]
*  He actually stayed with the wife, he didn't know who the mistress was [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5002.72s)]
*  That was his story [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5004.72s)]
*  He didn't know who she was [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5006.72s)]
*  Joey had owned an auto body shop [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5010.72s)]
*  And he had a shirt made for his auto body [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5012.72s)]
*  But the wife had made it [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5014.72s)]
*  She only made one or two [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5016.72s)]
*  And the mistress had one [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5018.72s)]
*  The shirt [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5020.72s)]
*  So Joey didn't even know [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5022.72s)]
*  He went that far [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5024.72s)]
*  He didn't even know her [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5026.72s)]
*  She stood by him [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5028.72s)]
*  But the wife's like, she has that shirt [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5030.72s)]
*  She goes, I only have one of those [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5032.72s)]
*  That's actually from a [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5034.72s)]
*  Miniseries movie [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5036.72s)]
*  I edited that from the movie [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5038.72s)]
*  But they said that that actually happened [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5040.72s)]
*  So this is Bonafuco [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5042.72s)]
*  But that's not China, is it? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5044.72s)]
*  I remember China being way bigger [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5046.72s)]
*  I didn't even know this happened [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5048.72s)]
*  Look at him [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5050.72s)]
*  That's how much stare it has improved [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5052.72s)]
*  China used to be huge [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5054.72s)]
*  In my head [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5056.72s)]
*  But that's how she's now [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5058.72s)]
*  She was huge compared to girls [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5060.72s)]
*  Why did they agree to it? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5064.72s)]
*  Who wanted to see it? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5066.72s)]
*  That is her [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5070.72s)]
*  I mean [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5072.72s)]
*  This was during the celebrity boxing thing [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5074.72s)]
*  This was a celebrity boxing match? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5076.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5078.72s)]
*  So celebrity boxing [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5080.72s)]
*  Wasn't commissioned by the Nevada State [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5082.72s)]
*  She was real dip [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5084.72s)]
*  Celebrity boxing popped for a second [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5086.72s)]
*  But it didn't have the influencer draw [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5088.72s)]
*  And the influencer draw is interesting [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5090.72s)]
*  Because you know exactly how many people [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5092.72s)]
*  More or less care about the individuals [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5094.72s)]
*  They had to guess [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5096.72s)]
*  I don't know if it was Bonafuco [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5098.72s)]
*  And they did for this one [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5100.72s)]
*  But other ones I don't think [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5102.72s)]
*  I care and we're 10 years later [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5104.72s)]
*  What year is this from, Mark? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5106.72s)]
*  2003 [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5108.72s)]
*  She was already big at this [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5110.72s)]
*  She had done the WWE thing [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5112.72s)]
*  She had a book [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5114.72s)]
*  What celebrity are you getting? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5116.72s)]
*  Trips used to tag that [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5118.72s)]
*  Trips was into a girl that looked like a boy [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5120.72s)]
*  Triple H is his name [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5122.72s)]
*  Hunter [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5124.72s)]
*  They were engaged [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5126.72s)]
*  Stephanie became the other woman [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5128.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5130.72s)]
*  Well it's fair and square [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5132.72s)]
*  When Trips goes [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5134.72s)]
*  I never heard of mistress taking a man [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5136.72s)]
*  And being described as fair and square [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5138.72s)]
*  She did that to somebody else [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5140.72s)]
*  And she's upset [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5142.72s)]
*  The possession is not intense to the law [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5144.72s)]
*  Did he cheat on her as well? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5146.72s)]
*  Many times [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5148.72s)]
*  He's fishing off the company pier [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5150.72s)]
*  What do they do over there? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5152.72s)]
*  What do you think happened to Vince? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5154.72s)]
*  I went on the Jim Rhoam show [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5156.72s)]
*  This was over a year ago [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5158.72s)]
*  Vince just got hit [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5160.72s)]
*  It was like 6 months ago [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5162.72s)]
*  It kind of feels like about 6 months ago [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5164.72s)]
*  I told Jim Rhoam, it was the middle of a smack up [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5166.72s)]
*  But I said I never met Vince [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5168.72s)]
*  And I know 11 people that he slept with [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5170.72s)]
*  8 of them women all consenting adults [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5172.72s)]
*  Which is the implication [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5174.72s)]
*  But that's true [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5176.72s)]
*  That wasn't the joke [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5178.72s)]
*  And Jim wouldn't run it, it was too hot [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5180.72s)]
*  Oh Jim, I wasn't joking [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5182.72s)]
*  I was talking trash [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5184.72s)]
*  But I wasn't joking [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5186.72s)]
*  Anyway, when Vince got me [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5188.72s)]
*  Tued out of the business, I did think it was a surprise [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5190.72s)]
*  But as good as he is [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5192.72s)]
*  I would not completely count that he could have come back [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5194.72s)]
*  When the men start coming out [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5196.72s)]
*  It will be a different story [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5198.72s)]
*  He used to bang dudes a lot [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5200.72s)]
*  But he would hold their careers over him [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5202.72s)]
*  Just like he would the women [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5204.72s)]
*  It was the same thing, you get paid more, you get pushed more [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5206.72s)]
*  This is not a secret in the industry [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5208.72s)]
*  Not at all am I talking about [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5210.72s)]
*  This was very well known [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5212.72s)]
*  But I mean Shawn Michaels [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5214.72s)]
*  Guys that you would know [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5216.72s)]
*  He was banging Shawn Michaels [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5218.72s)]
*  Well or whatever it is [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5220.72s)]
*  But yes, they had their [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5222.72s)]
*  Shawn Michaels was pretty good [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5224.72s)]
*  You wonder if I'm like, looks like doing a bit [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5226.72s)]
*  Long hair [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5228.72s)]
*  Shawn Michaels [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5230.72s)]
*  What about ravishing Rick Rude [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5232.72s)]
*  I don't remember him [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5234.72s)]
*  If you had a bang on a dude, who would it be? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5236.72s)]
*  He was [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5238.72s)]
*  Are you saying like if you had [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5240.72s)]
*  That perhaps Michaels was the right choice? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5242.72s)]
*  If you're Vince, who are you choosing? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5244.72s)]
*  Okay, well wow [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5246.72s)]
*  Or boxing, anime, whatever you know [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5248.72s)]
*  Community [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5250.72s)]
*  I'm trying to think of an anth [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5252.72s)]
*  Without sounding gay [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5254.72s)]
*  I don't want to do that, I'm trying to think of how [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5256.72s)]
*  To do that [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5258.72s)]
*  Go like Ray Mysterio so you don't have to see his face [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5260.72s)]
*  See, now that's a stud answer [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5262.72s)]
*  I was trying to process something [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5264.72s)]
*  But then that's one of the things [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5266.72s)]
*  There is a lot of [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5268.72s)]
*  Homosexuals that Vince came across [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5270.72s)]
*  But there was also straight guys that just wanted to push [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5272.72s)]
*  In the business where it turned into [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5274.72s)]
*  Prostitution [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5276.72s)]
*  That was very well known, and not just Vince, Pat Patterson [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5278.72s)]
*  And some other executives [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5280.72s)]
*  The world was different, like even Harvey Weinstein [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5282.72s)]
*  Talked about that on Howard Stern, like hey it's a different world [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5284.72s)]
*  I liked it more when it was back [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5286.72s)]
*  Then, what I'm saying is [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5288.72s)]
*  I'm trying to illustrate [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5290.72s)]
*  That is not a secret [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5292.72s)]
*  I'm trying to explain it to Harvey [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5294.72s)]
*  Harvey even said [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5296.72s)]
*  That it was a better way like that [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5298.72s)]
*  Back then, back when we could give him a job [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5300.72s)]
*  He openly spoke about it [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5302.72s)]
*  So Vince was clapping [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5304.72s)]
*  Hold on, let me understand [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5306.72s)]
*  So Vince was clapping dude cheeks and girl cheeks [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5308.72s)]
*  For pushes though [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5310.72s)]
*  That also didn't used to be illegal [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5312.72s)]
*  But now, yes [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5314.72s)]
*  Somebody's career dangles on that [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5316.72s)]
*  And he would tell, everybody would know [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5318.72s)]
*  This girl turned me down, she's pulled off TV [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5320.72s)]
*  So he goes to the next one [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5322.72s)]
*  But it is the different thing [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5324.72s)]
*  I think it's just power [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5326.72s)]
*  Like I want to lord this power over you [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5328.72s)]
*  I'm going to make you do things you don't want to do [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5330.72s)]
*  Dude especially, he probably got off more on that [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5332.72s)]
*  Just off of the power he felt [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5334.72s)]
*  No, I get it, but none of that is out [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5336.72s)]
*  People speculate that's psychology [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5338.72s)]
*  There's things that you can't buy when you're a billionaire [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5340.72s)]
*  So then you start seeing how far [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5342.72s)]
*  Can I go with things [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5344.72s)]
*  And that's sociopathy often like pushes people [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5346.72s)]
*  Who are also talented to the top [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5348.72s)]
*  But it's [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5350.72s)]
*  Just say allegedly around all that [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5352.72s)]
*  I talked to some people in wrestling [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5354.72s)]
*  And they were like [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5356.72s)]
*  Those texts are, we all 100% believe it's real [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5358.72s)]
*  Because I was like what 8 year old texts [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5360.72s)]
*  I mean what grown man texts like that [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5362.72s)]
*  It's an 8 year old texting with a U for a while [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5364.72s)]
*  Instead of Y-O-U-U [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5366.72s)]
*  Capitalization is off, he's like the big [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5368.72s)]
*  Everybody knows it's real because that's exactly how [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5370.72s)]
*  Sure, sure [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5372.72s)]
*  And yeah it really wasn't [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5374.72s)]
*  I mean that was internal, that was his own kids [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5376.72s)]
*  They knew that that was happening [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5378.72s)]
*  Oh really? Oh yeah, I mean it's not a secret [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5380.72s)]
*  The woman in the office is doing the least and we all park in the same lot [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5382.72s)]
*  And she's the one that pulls in the nicest car [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5384.72s)]
*  There was ones before her [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5386.72s)]
*  But they got old and they lost it and now she's the one [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5388.72s)]
*  And she got a little bit older [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5390.72s)]
*  And so he started bringing in other ones [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5392.72s)]
*  And so then she started to run out of money [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5394.72s)]
*  This wasn't something [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5396.72s)]
*  That was uncommon over there [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5398.72s)]
*  Vince spoke about this, he had told Razor Ramon [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5400.72s)]
*  Rest his soul [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5402.72s)]
*  That's another good one to take down [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5404.72s)]
*  He was telling the story of his homosexual experience [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5406.72s)]
*  And he went from there, Razor said [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5408.72s)]
*  I didn't know, that's how he revealed it to me [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5410.72s)]
*  Vince has spoke about this a number of times [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5412.72s)]
*  And people have always thought that he was joking [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5414.72s)]
*  He was never trying to joke [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5416.72s)]
*  He was just telling the story [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5418.72s)]
*  Wait, what is it? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5420.72s)]
*  Okay so basically he says [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5422.72s)]
*  This is Vince speaking [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5424.72s)]
*  He goes, let me tell you about my first homosexual experience [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5426.72s)]
*  I remember sitting, me and Kevin were both sitting in Vince's office [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5428.72s)]
*  At TV, I looked at Kevin, my first thought was [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5430.72s)]
*  As opposed to your most recent one, like you [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5432.72s)]
*  I remember when I was in college, I was in college [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5434.72s)]
*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5436.72s)]
*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5438.72s)]
*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5440.72s)]

*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5450.72s)]
*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5452.72s)]

*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5458.72s)]
*  And I was in college, and I was in college [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5460.72s)]
*  I found a way back in, grew a mustache [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5462.72s)]
*  I found a way back in, grew a mustache [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5464.72s)]
*  Not completely unlike yours, but then there was a new guy [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5466.72s)]
*  Not completely unlike yours, but then there was a new guy [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5468.72s)]
*  Might be something out there [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5470.72s)]
*  He changed his name, now he's Uncle Vinny, I can't remember what he said [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5472.72s)]
*  He changed his name, and then he would even talk about [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5474.72s)]
*  That guy, a year ago, that Vince McMahon [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5476.72s)]
*  Yeah, what a scumbag [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5478.72s)]
*  He is gone now, I am here [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5480.72s)]
*  Is he the greatest of all time? Character builder [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5482.72s)]
*  Vince is the greatest heel that wrestling's ever seen [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5484.72s)]
*  Okay, and it plays with me why [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5486.72s)]
*  Why he's outside of all the fucked up shit [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5488.72s)]
*  He is alleged to have done [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5490.72s)]
*  Explain to me just why at his job [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5492.72s)]
*  He's the greatest heel [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5494.72s)]
*  And why do people look at him, revere him so much [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5496.72s)]
*  In terms of building him up [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5498.72s)]
*  He just understood the psychology, I mean he could create so much heat [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5500.72s)]
*  He versus Hogan was like [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5502.72s)]
*  The biggest wrestler of all time [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5504.72s)]
*  And Vince wasn't even a wrestler, but you know there was something about [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5506.72s)]
*  Boss, him versus Stone Cold [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5508.72s)]
*  Was these great angles, but he would come out and walk [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5510.72s)]
*  In certain ways, he would brag about [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5512.72s)]
*  Being a billionaire, I mean guys with money [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5514.72s)]
*  Mitt Romney ran for president and tried to downplay himself [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5516.72s)]
*  Like alright, I just go to NASCAR and I eat KFC [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5518.72s)]
*  Like you never do that [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5520.72s)]
*  This was one of the first billionaires to say [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5522.72s)]
*  I have more than you and I am better than you [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5524.72s)]
*  Because of it, I will buy you and you will do what [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5526.72s)]
*  I say, he came out and did that [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5528.72s)]
*  And he said, in fact, don't call me Vince [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5530.72s)]
*  You call me Mr. McMahon, then he has his own [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5532.72s)]
*  Walk, and I mean it was just [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5534.72s)]
*  One of these things where you hated this guy [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5536.72s)]
*  This guy was awful [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5538.72s)]
*  He would blur the lines where he would like come out [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5540.72s)]
*  And say things on TV as part of that character [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5542.72s)]
*  That he actually did to people behind the scenes [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5544.72s)]
*  He would come out and say, you are going to do this [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5546.72s)]
*  I am going to pull your push, I will take you off TV [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5548.72s)]
*  I will put you over here, I decide who makes it in this business [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5550.72s)]
*  And it was all real things [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5552.72s)]
*  But he played into it, he turned himself up [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5554.72s)]
*  And he was just a great heel [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5556.72s)]
*  Another one you might remember, Ted DiBiase [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5558.72s)]
*  The million dollar man [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5560.72s)]
*  Ted DiBiase's character [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5562.72s)]
*  As the million dollar man [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5564.72s)]
*  Largely is what Vince actually was [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5566.72s)]
*  Vince just made himself the billion dollar man [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5568.72s)]
*  Ted DiBiase was hated, he would pay you to [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5572.72s)]
*  Went to a hospital, his fingers cut [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5574.72s)]
*  So there is a line of kids in this [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5576.72s)]
*  This is such a great video [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5578.72s)]
*  And broken arms and stuff, kids in wheelchairs [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5580.72s)]
*  Kids that need to get to the emergency room [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5582.72s)]
*  Vince cuts the line, they won't let him [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5584.72s)]
*  Ted or Vince? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5586.72s)]
*  DiBiase, million dollar man, then he gives him 200 [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5588.72s)]
*  300, 400, until they finally [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5590.72s)]
*  Let him cut in front of all these people so he can get a band-aid [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5592.72s)]
*  And he turns into a line of kids [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5594.72s)]
*  Like an orphan [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5596.72s)]
*  Everybody has a price for the million dollar man [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5598.72s)]
*  And it was the [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5600.72s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5602.72s)]
*  He was doing all sorts of stuff like that [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5604.72s)]
*  Cut the line, he is Virgil [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5606.72s)]
*  He is paying the money, it really was unbelievable [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5608.72s)]
*  At what age do you realize the importance of the heel? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5610.72s)]
*  Because as a kid [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5612.72s)]
*  I think we would look at these heels [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5614.72s)]
*  And we are unaware that they are [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5616.72s)]
*  We know that they are fake, but we truly [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5618.72s)]
*  Don't like them [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5620.72s)]
*  And now I feel like the heel we like to not like [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5622.72s)]
*  We enjoy to boo them [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5624.72s)]
*  We are in on the game [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5626.72s)]
*  But it is still a game [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5628.72s)]
*  There is a transition that happens [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5630.72s)]
*  For you is it young? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5632.72s)]
*  Are you watching these guys and going [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5634.72s)]
*  I know they are the bad guys, but I kind of like them [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5636.72s)]
*  No, I didn't get it [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5638.72s)]
*  I didn't get it until college age [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5640.72s)]
*  When I came back [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5642.72s)]
*  I had left wrestling, I left in middle school [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5644.72s)]
*  I didn't do it in high school, but when I came back in college [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5646.72s)]
*  That was the attitude era [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5648.72s)]
*  That's when Austin had gotten fired [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5650.72s)]
*  When The Rock went from being a football player [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5652.72s)]
*  Whose grandparents used to wrestle [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5654.72s)]
*  To The Rock [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5656.72s)]
*  They had to rebuild, Hogan and everybody had left [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5658.72s)]
*  It was a really interesting time [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5660.72s)]
*  WCW vs. WWE [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5662.72s)]
*  That was really [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5664.72s)]
*  Talk about an industry to study [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5666.72s)]
*  But that's when I came back [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5668.72s)]
*  That's when I started to get it and enjoy it [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5670.72s)]
*  When I was a younger kid [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5672.72s)]
*  I believed it, I thought it was real [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5674.72s)]
*  I remember The Rock being the person [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5676.72s)]
*  That made me be like, oh, the heel is fire [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5678.72s)]
*  It was so funny [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5680.72s)]
*  A cool heel is the most [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5682.72s)]
*  Monetizable thing [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5684.72s)]
*  In the industry, in any sporting industry [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5686.72s)]
*  It's very rare [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5688.72s)]
*  But if you have a cool heel [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5690.72s)]
*  That's money [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5692.72s)]
*  The Rock would go into that category, Austin would go into that category [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5694.72s)]
*  So you have the bad guy [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5696.72s)]
*  But he still looks cooler [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5698.72s)]
*  Why was Austin a bad guy? I remember when Rock was a bad guy [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5700.72s)]
*  I don't remember Austin as a bad guy [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5702.72s)]
*  Austin, oh yes, Austin used [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5704.72s)]
*  They were going to throw him on TV [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5706.72s)]
*  He said, ouch [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5708.72s)]
*  Drinks like beer, which is bad [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5710.72s)]
*  I remember the turning point [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5712.72s)]
*  That was right when my brother started watching wrestling [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5714.72s)]
*  So I started, was he fought Triple H [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5716.72s)]
*  In a submission match [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5718.72s)]
*  And then they had him turn face because he just wouldn't quit [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5720.72s)]
*  Like he's bleeding from the head, refuses to tap out [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5722.72s)]
*  And that's when everybody [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5724.72s)]
*  They start celebrating and building him up as a face [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5726.72s)]
*  But he still keeps this [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5728.72s)]
*  Yeah, incredible [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5730.72s)]
*  So cool heel, and can you manufacture [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5732.72s)]
*  Cool heel, or is that [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5734.72s)]
*  You just are cool and you end up [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5736.72s)]
*  Being a heel? I would think McGregor would go [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5738.72s)]
*  Into cool heel [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5740.72s)]
*  By the way [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5742.72s)]
*  I would ride into your [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5744.72s)]
*  Favella on horseback [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5746.72s)]
*  Cut off the head of any man not fit to work [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5748.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5750.72s)]
*  What a, oh my god [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5752.72s)]
*  Take the women and children and cut off the head [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5754.72s)]
*  If this was back in the day [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5756.72s)]
*  The McGregor clan would ride into your Favella on horseback [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5758.72s)]
*  Claim not only would he do it [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5760.72s)]
*  That his ancestors did do it [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5762.72s)]
*  That's a heel move [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5764.72s)]
*  The Irish ancestors [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5766.72s)]
*  Went to Brazil, immediately got skin cancer [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5768.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5770.72s)]
*  Well you were asking about Austin [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5772.72s)]
*  Austin had come out and said the word ass [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5774.72s)]
*  And that had never been done [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5776.72s)]
*  Oh my god, they thought they were going to have to pull him off TV [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5778.72s)]
*  This was on a pay per view on a Sunday [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5780.72s)]
*  Vince was irate [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5782.72s)]
*  So he looks rebellious, he's fighting against the company [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5784.72s)]
*  And it actually was [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5786.72s)]
*  Oh, it was real [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5788.72s)]
*  It's called going into business for yourself, where there is a script and you're live on TV [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5790.72s)]
*  And he did not follow the script [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5792.72s)]
*  He knew I could be fired or I'm going to make it [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5794.72s)]
*  But I'm going into business, I'm taking a chance here [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5796.72s)]
*  I'm going to get you, but I think I'm right [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5798.72s)]
*  And I think I know this audience [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5800.72s)]
*  And then Vince knows heat [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5802.72s)]
*  So he sees the heat that comes off of it [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5804.72s)]
*  And instead of firing he goes [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5806.72s)]
*  Give them the fucking reins [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5808.72s)]
*  It was on a Sunday at a pay per view [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5810.72s)]
*  They got to catch a plane, they're live in a town for Monday night [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5812.72s)]
*  And Vince was going to pull him [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5814.72s)]
*  And when he said the word ass [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5816.72s)]
*  He also said, well he said Austin 316 [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5818.72s)]
*  Says I just whipped your ass [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5820.72s)]
*  When they got to the arena the next night [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5822.72s)]
*  They had 316 signs everywhere [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5824.72s)]
*  And he was like you [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5826.72s)]
*  He was going to keep them in the back [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5828.72s)]
*  But when he saw the signs [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5830.72s)]
*  He realized this worked [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5832.72s)]
*  And then he kept doing it [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5834.72s)]
*  There was even this weird time where every wrestler started saying ass [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5836.72s)]
*  It's like no guys stop [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5838.72s)]
*  But at that point [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5840.72s)]
*  There was good guys and bad guys [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5842.72s)]
*  For sure [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5844.72s)]
*  You didn't know where he was [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5846.72s)]
*  He hated the good guys, he hated the bad guys [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5848.72s)]
*  He was the first guy ever, he hated them all [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5850.72s)]
*  He stood by himself [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5852.72s)]
*  Against the bad guys, the good guys [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5854.72s)]
*  Everybody got the middle finger [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5856.72s)]
*  And that had never been done [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5858.72s)]
*  Didn't he do that on USA? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5860.72s)]
*  Remember they blurred out? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5862.72s)]
*  Drinking beer and stuff [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5864.72s)]
*  Now these normal things [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5866.72s)]
*  If you had to liken yourself [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5868.72s)]
*  And your character if you will [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5870.72s)]
*  As you played throughout your career [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5872.72s)]
*  Who would it be most similar to? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5874.72s)]
*  Definitely a collection of a number of people [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5878.72s)]
*  But I would definitely ask myself [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5880.72s)]
*  What would Stone Cold do? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5882.72s)]
*  In this situation [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5884.72s)]
*  I would sometimes even call Stone Cold [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5886.72s)]
*  And say in a situation [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5888.72s)]
*  How would you handle this? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5890.72s)]
*  The character specifically [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5892.72s)]
*  How would that happen? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5894.72s)]
*  Any advice he gave you that was great? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5896.72s)]
*  He gave me a couple of promos [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5898.72s)]
*  For John Jones [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5900.72s)]
*  Yeah he did [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5902.72s)]
*  But there was more ideas [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5904.72s)]
*  I ended up not even using it [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5906.72s)]
*  I called him and he answered the phone [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5908.72s)]
*  And I told him [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5910.72s)]
*  I gotta take on this guy [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5912.72s)]
*  He's a lot younger and bigger [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5914.72s)]
*  And he says [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5916.72s)]
*  I'm driving down the road right now [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5918.72s)]
*  A two lane road with a yellow stripe in the middle [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5920.72s)]
*  Reminds me of John Jones [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5922.72s)]
*  Got that yellow stripe right down his back [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5924.72s)]
*  And he just starts cutting a promo [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5926.72s)]
*  But it's like what's actually happening [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5928.72s)]
*  He's just thinking as he's talking [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5930.72s)]
*  And taking the time to give this to me [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5932.72s)]
*  But it was more to just turn my brain on [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5934.72s)]
*  To what a promo was [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5936.72s)]
*  It didn't sound like [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5938.72s)]
*  I see a lot of fighters will have one line [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5940.72s)]
*  And they'll drop that one line [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5942.72s)]
*  The crowd does nothing and then they're not ready for the follow up question [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5944.72s)]
*  And so then they drop the energy in the character [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5946.72s)]
*  And they just go back to themselves [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5948.72s)]
*  It's just this awkward [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5950.72s)]
*  I wish the person interviewed them just dropped the mic and go [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5952.72s)]
*  It's worse when they hit that line [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5954.72s)]
*  And then they [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5956.72s)]
*  Yeah and then they come out of it [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5958.72s)]
*  The other side, we were talking about interviews earlier [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5960.72s)]
*  But the UFC [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5962.72s)]
*  Everybody gets the same amount of time [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5964.72s)]
*  And I do think Connor should get triple the time [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5966.72s)]
*  Or Rampage [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5968.72s)]
*  Who should have got triple the time [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5970.72s)]
*  And I've never understood that [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5972.72s)]
*  Why are you cutting his mic? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5974.72s)]
*  We're all here to hear this moment [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5976.72s)]
*  Everyone else gets 30 seconds [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5978.72s)]
*  He doesn't, he gets 5 minutes [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5980.72s)]
*  Give him the mic back [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5982.72s)]
*  Rampage another one by the way [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5984.72s)]
*  But you never know what he's going to say [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5986.72s)]
*  How sharp are the WWE guys in terms of developing their character? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5988.72s)]
*  Is a lot of it sort of prescribed by Vince [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5990.72s)]
*  Or by like upper brass [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5992.72s)]
*  Or by the way, is it them actually developing the actual ins and outs? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5994.72s)]
*  They are expected to do it [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5996.72s)]
*  And it's one thing the guys that go into that business [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=5998.72s)]
*  Do not know [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6000.72s)]
*  Like you could be a huge star [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6002.72s)]
*  And Vince might give you something like Vince wants a guy that does X, Y, or Z [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6004.72s)]
*  And Vince likes to take real life characters [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6006.72s)]
*  And then the IRS [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6008.72s)]
*  Everybody's scared of the IRS [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6010.72s)]
*  So Vince creates a guy called Irvin R. Scheister [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6012.72s)]
*  IRS [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6014.72s)]
*  It was just smart things like this [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6016.72s)]
*  So people hate the rich guy and the million dollar man [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6018.72s)]
*  Vince was very good at that and he would tell you [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6020.72s)]
*  And then there would be as they said it [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6022.72s)]
*  There would be a wardrobe guy there [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6024.72s)]
*  And then the sound guy would be there [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6026.72s)]
*  So then you go talk with wardrobe about what you need [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6028.72s)]
*  And you and the sound guy try to figure out how to do that [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6030.72s)]
*  And that's it, and it even works or it doesn't [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6032.72s)]
*  If you do a great job at it and it's Vince's idea [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6034.72s)]
*  And it doesn't get over, you're out [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6036.72s)]
*  I mean it's a really big deal [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6038.72s)]
*  But the wrestlers a lot of times don't know that [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6040.72s)]
*  They don't know the psychology [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6042.72s)]
*  They don't know, you know, when I show up I'm in charge of this [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6044.72s)]
*  Hacksaw Jim Duggan had to go to the 2x4 [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6046.72s)]
*  And make sure he had [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6048.72s)]
*  These gimmicks or guys that weren't changed [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6050.72s)]
*  They had to bring that themselves and if they forgot it [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6052.72s)]
*  And didn't have their gimmick that night they're not going to get over [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6054.72s)]
*  And they could be out the door [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6056.72s)]
*  So it is very incumbent upon them [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6058.72s)]
*  To take you whether it's acting classes or whatever it might be [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6060.72s)]
*  And ripping guys off in WWE is encouraged [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6062.72s)]
*  Like hey go take a movie and find a character [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6066.72s)]
*  And then just come out and be that guy [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6068.72s)]
*  Razor Ramon who I mentioned earlier [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6070.72s)]
*  But he had watched Scarface [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6072.72s)]
*  He was Cuban and say hello to the bad guys [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6074.72s)]
*  It was very simple but he stole that [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6076.72s)]
*  He stole that from the movie and didn't hide that fact [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6078.72s)]
*  Interesting [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6080.72s)]
*  Do you feel like there's an interplay with UFC [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6082.72s)]
*  Or actual mixed martial arts guys [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6084.72s)]
*  And WWE guys in terms of respect [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6086.72s)]
*  Do WWE guys see them and be like [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6088.72s)]
*  Yeah but you're a real fighter [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6090.72s)]
*  And do the fighters look at them and be like [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6092.72s)]
*  Yeah but you can sell anything you're the best [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6094.72s)]
*  Yes, and I think it's more us [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6096.72s)]
*  I think fighters if they got a chance to go into WWE [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6098.72s)]
*  Would and I don't think WWE would come over [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6100.72s)]
*  And fighters watch WWE [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6102.72s)]
*  And appreciate it [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6104.72s)]
*  And WWE does, that includes Vince [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6106.72s)]
*  Vince was so locked on his product [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6108.72s)]
*  He legitimately did not [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6110.72s)]
*  Know other sports and [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6112.72s)]
*  Who is who, whether that's for better or worse [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6114.72s)]
*  He was an animal by the way [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6116.72s)]
*  I wasn't trying to tease him earlier [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6118.72s)]
*  But when you talk about could Vince come back [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6120.72s)]
*  He's come back from everything [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6122.72s)]
*  But I think [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6124.72s)]
*  He's trying to come back now [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6126.72s)]
*  I think he's still trying to work in [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6128.72s)]
*  Ronda Rousey and other people in that company say he's still the one calling Bruce Prichard [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6130.72s)]
*  He's still calling the shots [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6132.72s)]
*  And whether that's true or [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6134.72s)]
*  Trips has put his foot down [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6136.72s)]
*  But I don't know [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6138.72s)]
*  I think Vince is trying to come back [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6140.72s)]
*  Would you be involved [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6142.72s)]
*  In wrestling? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6144.72s)]
*  How is that not [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6146.72s)]
*  I would be involved to a degree [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6148.72s)]
*  Do you see what Pat McAfee is doing? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6150.72s)]
*  What a growth by Pat McAfee [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6152.72s)]
*  That guy came out of nowhere [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6154.72s)]
*  At least for me, they said he used to kick [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6156.72s)]
*  And a hell player [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6158.72s)]
*  Works as an anthem though [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6160.72s)]
*  But I don't know, even though he's a kicker [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6162.72s)]
*  I don't know what to do, maybe I'm being naive [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6164.72s)]
*  But I'm just saying I know a lot about him [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6166.72s)]
*  But I sure know about him now [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6168.72s)]
*  I mean he got like a hundred million dollar deal [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6170.72s)]
*  At ESPN, he's doing the WWE thing [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6172.72s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt, greatest likeable heel [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6174.72s)]
*  We've ever seen, Donald Trump [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6176.72s)]
*  Fucking President [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6178.72s)]
*  Of the United States [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6180.72s)]
*  Likeable heel, cool heel [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6182.72s)]
*  You will not convince me [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6184.72s)]
*  That Vince McMahon did not run that campaign [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6186.72s)]
*  In 2016 [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6188.72s)]
*  What do you think Trump learned from Vince McMahon? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6190.72s)]
*  I believe Vince ran that [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6192.72s)]
*  Vince was the greatest influence [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6194.72s)]
*  Vince's number one thing, yes it is business [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6196.72s)]
*  And entertainment, but it's psychology [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6198.72s)]
*  Vince has taken a product that he's telling you [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6200.72s)]
*  Is fake, and then making you cry [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6202.72s)]
*  When your guy doesn't win [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6204.72s)]
*  Because you forgot that it's fake [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6206.72s)]
*  And buy a t-shirt on your way out [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6208.72s)]
*  His ability to understand psychology [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6210.72s)]
*  You remember when Trump had the tape [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6212.72s)]
*  Came out with Billy Bush [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6214.72s)]
*  And he was going to grab him [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6216.72s)]
*  And then he showed up [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6218.72s)]
*  That was 11 days before the campaign [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6220.72s)]
*  Just to remind you guys, it was over [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6222.72s)]
*  I remember where I was when I got the phone call [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6224.72s)]
*  It was over, everyone pulled out [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6226.72s)]
*  Guys that had put money in didn't send the checks [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6228.72s)]
*  They cancelled the checks, it was over [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6230.72s)]
*  Vince McMahon put 8 million dollars in [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6232.72s)]
*  With 11 days left, Vince sent him 8 million dollars [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6234.72s)]
*  Vince is the only person to send him [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6236.72s)]
*  And why, why, why, what was his [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6238.72s)]
*  Vince said we're not losing [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6240.72s)]
*  We're not losing, it's not over yet [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6242.72s)]
*  Not even close [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6244.72s)]
*  And when Trump got in [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6246.72s)]
*  There was no mention of this [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6248.72s)]
*  He had catch phrases [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6250.72s)]
*  He had lock them up, he started giving them nicknames [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6252.72s)]
*  He started having the same songs [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6254.72s)]
*  It was like walk out music [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6256.72s)]
*  He was having chance from the crowd [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6258.72s)]
*  His campaign was exactly the way Vince [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6260.72s)]
*  Promotes Wrestlemania [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6262.72s)]
*  And I do mean exactly [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6264.72s)]
*  And then as soon as Trump got hired [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6266.72s)]
*  It was on the first day, which is not literal [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6268.72s)]
*  One of his first assignments was Linda [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6270.72s)]
*  She got appointed small business [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6272.72s)]
*  Vince just wants her out of the house [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6274.72s)]
*  He got the boys and girls [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6276.72s)]
*  Just get her to DC [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6278.72s)]
*  Linda is his wife [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6280.72s)]
*  Oh he hires her [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6282.72s)]
*  Right away, and I mean like that [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6284.72s)]
*  Which by the way [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6286.72s)]
*  Which by the way was a good appointment [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6288.72s)]
*  She's solid [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6290.72s)]
*  She's real solid [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6292.72s)]
*  It's very interesting [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6294.72s)]
*  And one of the reasons I keep bringing Vince up [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6296.72s)]
*  Because I felt like we were talking about psychology [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6298.72s)]
*  Connor, we started with that [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6300.72s)]
*  That formula work [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6302.72s)]
*  And it's like this is the master [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6304.72s)]
*  Vince is truly, he can evoke that emotion [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6306.72s)]
*  He can sell out arenas [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6308.72s)]
*  It's a stunning thing [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6310.72s)]
*  So that's the thing that impresses me [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6312.72s)]
*  About Vince [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6314.72s)]
*  And other people that can [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6316.72s)]
*  Curate this type of promotion [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6318.72s)]
*  There are certain people who are superstars [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6320.72s)]
*  And that's not to say that they don't know it [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6322.72s)]
*  And they can lean into it and create these moments [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6324.72s)]
*  But there are some people that can't help themselves [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6326.72s)]
*  They're just saying outlandish things all the time [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6328.72s)]
*  They just have no filter [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6330.72s)]
*  We don't really know how in control [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6332.72s)]
*  Of Tyson's celebrity he is [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6334.72s)]
*  I have great admiration for what he's achieved [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6336.72s)]
*  But there might be things that he says [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6338.72s)]
*  That he is not trying to be entertaining [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6340.72s)]
*  To become the most entertaining things [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6342.72s)]
*  Everything Vince has done is curated [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6344.72s)]
*  That to me is the most [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6346.72s)]
*  Impressive when you are [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6348.72s)]
*  Making the things [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6350.72s)]
*  That we usually only like when they're [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6352.72s)]
*  Authentic [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6354.72s)]
*  Up to a year in advance [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6356.72s)]
*  I mean add that to your [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6358.72s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6360.72s)]
*  No it truly is a stunning thing [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6362.72s)]
*  And then adapting through different times [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6364.72s)]
*  Vince had to appeal to Junior High Kids [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6366.72s)]
*  Decades since we're kids [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6368.72s)]
*  And now it's not Junior High Kids [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6370.72s)]
*  It's outreach [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6372.72s)]
*  So I mean different markets [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6374.72s)]
*  And different times [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6376.72s)]
*  I waited online to buy a book [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6378.72s)]
*  For The Rock where he was doing a signing [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6380.72s)]
*  Of Tower Books [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6382.72s)]
*  And I remember just saying [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6384.72s)]
*  I've waited online and I've seen this massive line [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6386.72s)]
*  Around the block where there are like [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6388.72s)]
*  Kids that are buying books [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6390.72s)]
*  This is before the Harry Potter era where reading was cool [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6392.72s)]
*  This is during the era where [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6394.72s)]
*  You were almost [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6396.72s)]
*  Rejecting anything that had [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6398.72s)]
*  An intellectual spin to it [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6400.72s)]
*  We're online to buy this [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6402.72s)]
*  The Rock book [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6404.72s)]
*  And I'm sitting there and I'm like a kid [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6406.72s)]
*  So you're not really reflecting that much [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6408.72s)]
*  But I'm like what the fuck is going on [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6410.72s)]
*  On the line people are practicing their rock impressions [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6412.72s)]
*  When they get to him [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6414.72s)]
*  It doesn't matter [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6416.72s)]
*  And I'm looking at this and this is all [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6418.72s)]
*  Now obviously tons of credit [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6420.72s)]
*  To The Rock for this [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6422.72s)]
*  But there's also credit for the boss recognizing what he has [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6424.72s)]
*  And leaning into it [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6426.72s)]
*  Obviously the guys [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6428.72s)]
*  Has he been booked for the shit that he did? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6430.72s)]
*  Did he go to jail [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6432.72s)]
*  For any of the things he did? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6434.72s)]
*  No [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6436.72s)]
*  Not even facing that [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6438.72s)]
*  But you'd still want to sit down and have one of these combos [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6440.72s)]
*  Where it's just like break down what you know about human beings [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6442.72s)]
*  The first time you sat down here [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6444.72s)]
*  That was the first thing I asked [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6446.72s)]
*  You get something [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6448.72s)]
*  That gives you a huge advantage [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6450.72s)]
*  In this game [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6452.72s)]
*  That these other guys try to create [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6454.72s)]
*  And you called it out about the post fight conference [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6456.72s)]
*  They're like okay if I have my one witty line I'm good [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6458.72s)]
*  I don't see you break character [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6460.72s)]
*  During that [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6462.72s)]
*  During the post fight [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6464.72s)]
*  Like I'll look at your post fight [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6466.72s)]
*  Joe will ask you a question [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6468.72s)]
*  You're going to say what the fuck you're going to say [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6470.72s)]
*  That's right [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6472.72s)]
*  And I tell people don't answer [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6474.72s)]
*  You're not here to answer questions, you're here to handle questions [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6476.72s)]
*  Let him ask the questions [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6478.72s)]
*  Here's what you [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6480.72s)]
*  Go right into [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6482.72s)]
*  And you're right I never broke character because I was always ready for it [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6484.72s)]
*  But I wanted more [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6486.72s)]
*  I was disappointed when Rogan had [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6488.72s)]
*  Bring the mic down [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6490.72s)]
*  More like this is fun [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6492.72s)]
*  The fight's not fun [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6494.72s)]
*  This is the fight [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6496.72s)]
*  This is my moment [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6498.72s)]
*  When they ended [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6500.72s)]
*  It's over and now I got to redo this whole thing [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6502.72s)]
*  Just to get those 90 seconds [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6504.72s)]
*  The only part of this I enjoyed was those [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6506.72s)]
*  90 seconds and now they're gone [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6508.72s)]
*  Why don't you be part of [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6510.72s)]
*  Wrestling in some way [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6512.72s)]
*  To me it's such a no brainer [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6514.72s)]
*  You understand psychology of it [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6516.72s)]
*  You already have the mic skills [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6518.72s)]
*  You have the athleticism if you need to do it [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6520.72s)]
*  But you could also do something to what [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6522.72s)]
*  Like Vincent now I guess with Triple H [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6524.72s)]
*  It's not just about the [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6526.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6528.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6530.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6532.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6534.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6536.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6538.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6540.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6542.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6544.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6546.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6548.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6550.72s)]
*  It's about the way you're going to do it [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6552.72s)]
*  Oh my goodness, I was an NCAA All-American [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6554.72s)]
*  So I was in really good shape [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6556.72s)]
*  I barely got through this thing [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6558.72s)]
*  This would require such mental toughness [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6560.72s)]
*  It was so hard, we had to do three things guys [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6562.72s)]
*  And this was for three days [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6564.72s)]
*  Two full days and then the Sunday was a half day [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6566.72s)]
*  But there was a bucket [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6568.72s)]
*  Five gallon bucket, you put it upside down [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6570.72s)]
*  And when you do your squat [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6572.72s)]
*  You got to come up on your toes, you got to throw your hands up [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6574.72s)]
*  And you don't stop until you sit down on the bucket [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6576.72s)]
*  And the reason I remember that is [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6578.72s)]
*  The bucket had a little lip and we did so many of these damn [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6580.72s)]
*  You can't see the bucket [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6582.72s)]
*  It was cutting into all of our legs [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6584.72s)]
*  You did 50 of those [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6586.72s)]
*  I apologize [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6588.72s)]
*  You did 25 of those, 25 push-ups [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6590.72s)]
*  50 sit-ups [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6592.72s)]
*  And you got up and you did it again [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6594.72s)]
*  And you got up and did it again [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6596.72s)]
*  When you've had enough, go home [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6598.72s)]
*  Don't come back [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6600.72s)]
*  It was Navy Seal-esque [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6602.72s)]
*  And guys were out of there early [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6604.72s)]
*  Really early [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6606.72s)]
*  And we just did sit-ups and squats and push-ups [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6608.72s)]
*  And we went back and did sit-ups [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6610.72s)]
*  And that is all that we did [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6612.72s)]
*  And we did it the next day [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6614.72s)]
*  And the third day, it's all we did [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6616.72s)]
*  And then they took us to the parking lot and we did some sprints as well [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6618.72s)]
*  But by then everybody was gone [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6620.72s)]
*  It was just me and the other guy [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6622.72s)]
*  We were the only ones that showed up on the third day [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6624.72s)]
*  We made it through, they were like, you two were invited back [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6626.72s)]
*  Which invited back, now you pay us money [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6628.72s)]
*  It was a business ploy [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6630.72s)]
*  But it was really difficult [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6632.72s)]
*  And that was my only foray [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6634.72s)]
*  When I came out of college [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6636.72s)]
*  And I was walking around, there was no social media [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6638.72s)]
*  And people didn't have phones [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6640.72s)]
*  My point is, contacting someone was hard back then [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6642.72s)]
*  But what about now? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6644.72s)]
*  You would have really known somebody [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6646.72s)]
*  But why not now? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6648.72s)]
*  I got ESPN, I got my thing with USC [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6650.72s)]
*  I'm not against it [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6652.72s)]
*  But by the way, I guess maybe [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6654.72s)]
*  A more candid answer is I don't know how [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6656.72s)]
*  I don't know who to contact [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6658.72s)]
*  Do I go to Triple H [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6660.72s)]
*  That guy that I just told you was banging China [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6662.72s)]
*  That boy [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6664.72s)]
*  Do I go to him? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6666.72s)]
*  Or do I call Stephanie who I said was the other woman [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6668.72s)]
*  And then shouldn't be upset when there became another woman? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6670.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6672.72s)]
*  I feel like they're okay [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6674.72s)]
*  They should know character building [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6676.72s)]
*  I think at a certain position [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6678.72s)]
*  Owner of the Dallas Cowboys [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6680.72s)]
*  Somewhat similar, Jerry Jones [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6682.72s)]
*  Whatever you say about him, he doesn't care [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6684.72s)]
*  Because he knows it's all good in the end [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6686.72s)]
*  Everything is good for me [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6688.72s)]
*  I think Vince is the more so even probably [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6690.72s)]
*  And then he probably passed that on to the kids [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6692.72s)]
*  Whatever they say about you, it's okay, it's good [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6694.72s)]
*  Good, bad, ugly, it's good [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6696.72s)]
*  A lot of guys say that [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6698.72s)]
*  But they don't mean it [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6700.72s)]
*  Most of us don't mean it [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6702.72s)]
*  But you are correct [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6704.72s)]
*  Can I just say one more thing [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6706.72s)]
*  And I'm glad that we did because nobody else is [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6708.72s)]
*  Nobody is talking up for Brock Lesnar [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6710.72s)]
*  Well, but he went through eight losses [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6712.72s)]
*  What happened with Brock? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6714.72s)]
*  They have canceled Brock [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6716.72s)]
*  Brock is alleged [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6718.72s)]
*  Not from the person by the way [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6720.72s)]
*  Somebody else say that the person said [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6722.72s)]
*  Which quite frankly I don't doubt [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6724.72s)]
*  But it's still hearsay [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6726.72s)]
*  That Brock sent naughty text messages [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6728.72s)]
*  Nothing more [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6730.72s)]
*  Not confirmed [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6732.72s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it is confirmed that Brock has never met this human being [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6734.72s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it's confirmed that Brock has never spoke to this human being [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6736.72s)]
*  It is believed that a naughty text [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6738.72s)]
*  Came from a number that is believed [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6740.72s)]
*  To be Brock's [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6742.72s)]
*  They canceled him [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6744.72s)]
*  And I mean out [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6746.72s)]
*  He will never come back [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6748.72s)]
*  He went down with Vince [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6750.72s)]
*  So he's tied to Vince [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6752.72s)]
*  Everything that Vince has done, Brock is now tied [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6754.72s)]
*  Nobody has spoken up for him [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6756.72s)]
*  Nobody has defended him [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6758.72s)]
*  Now Brock doesn't have a friend in the media [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6760.72s)]
*  Because Brock has never done a damn thing for anybody else [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6762.72s)]
*  But nobody has been metude [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6764.72s)]
*  And to think that he doesn't have one friend that will speak up and just say [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6766.72s)]
*  Hey by the way, you don't even know it's him [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6768.72s)]
*  You haven't even asked him if it's him [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6770.72s)]
*  He hasn't even commented [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6772.72s)]
*  The person in question didn't complain about it [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6774.72s)]
*  She allegedly told someone else who wrote about it [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6776.72s)]
*  He's never been tied to Brock [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6778.72s)]
*  How does this even enter [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6780.72s)]
*  Allegedly, and by the way, they were [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6782.72s)]
*  I don't know if you guys know the story, but allegedly they were like planning to meet [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6784.72s)]
*  And Brock was doing [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6786.72s)]
*  He was being, whoever this person was [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6788.72s)]
*  They were being like a normal guy [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6790.72s)]
*  Hey send me a pic and then upping it [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6792.72s)]
*  Now send this and send that [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6794.72s)]
*  What if I did this [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6796.72s)]
*  Let's get a killer, kill a homeless person [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6798.72s)]
*  Wait who says that? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6800.72s)]
*  I was performing [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6802.72s)]
*  That's Aziz [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6804.72s)]
*  Aziz's pic [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6806.72s)]
*  Kill the homeless person [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6808.72s)]
*  And great job Aziz [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6810.72s)]
*  I'm just curious [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6812.72s)]
*  Is the alleged woman, maybe the wife of somebody [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6814.72s)]
*  Very important? [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6816.72s)]
*  No, she worked in the office [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6818.72s)]
*  She was a gal, she was in on it [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6820.72s)]
*  She's actually not mad about it or claiming like [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6822.72s)]
*  From a sexual force [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6824.72s)]
*  There's no crime other than [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6826.72s)]
*  She had an NDA [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6828.72s)]
*  She was owed 2 million dollars [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6830.72s)]
*  She got 1 million of it, the other million didn't come [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6832.72s)]
*  You owe me a million dollars, which by the way, she's right [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6834.72s)]
*  It is very clear that she is owed a million dollars [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6836.72s)]
*  It's not clear why that money was [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6838.72s)]
*  Pulled, like what this has cost Vince [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6840.72s)]
*  When he could have just, that's a little bit unclear [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6842.72s)]
*  But that is what happened [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6844.72s)]
*  No, she is not going to the police [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6846.72s)]
*  And saying I was forced into anything [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6848.72s)]
*  Nope, wow [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6850.72s)]
*  In what capacity was he involved before? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6852.72s)]
*  Before he got cancelled [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6854.72s)]
*  And is that Vince? Brock [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6856.72s)]
*  What was Brock doing? Cause my [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6858.72s)]
*  Oh for them, he was their top draw [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6860.72s)]
*  When he got cancelled he was their top draw? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6862.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, you could argue it was [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6864.72s)]
*  Roman Reigns, but I think [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6866.72s)]
*  It was Brock, you couldn't argue it was anybody [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6868.72s)]
*  Other than Brock or Roman, no he was the biggest [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6870.72s)]
*  And he finally found a gimmick that he liked [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6872.72s)]
*  He was playing like cowboy slash butcher Brock [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6874.72s)]
*  He was cutting up meat in the back [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6876.72s)]
*  But you could see his face [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6878.72s)]
*  He was genuinely for the first time [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6880.72s)]
*  Having fun [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6882.72s)]
*  As much as people would look at Brock's life and go [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6884.72s)]
*  I want that, he really didn't have fun [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6886.72s)]
*  He doesn't travel well [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6888.72s)]
*  He's very uncomfortable [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6890.72s)]
*  And he's pulled a lot of directions [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6892.72s)]
*  He's got a social anxiety [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6894.72s)]
*  He told people, even people that were close to him [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6896.72s)]
*  I don't have a cell phone [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6898.72s)]
*  But he just didn't want you to call him [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6900.72s)]
*  And that was people close to him [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6902.72s)]
*  People really believed he didn't have a sense [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6904.72s)]
*  He's got it right in his pocket [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6906.72s)]
*  But it was one of those things where he [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6908.72s)]
*  Slightly moved out in the middle of essentially nowhere [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6910.72s)]
*  And that was just the life that he wanted [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6912.72s)]
*  I only say that because [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6914.72s)]
*  When people looked at him and go what a superstar [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6916.72s)]
*  He didn't want people patting him on the back and surrounding him [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6918.72s)]
*  He didn't want anything more than to walk into those arena [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6920.72s)]
*  And walk out [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6922.72s)]
*  He waved everybody, be nice [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6924.72s)]
*  But it was one of those things [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6926.72s)]
*  And he's actually done a lot for people that no one knows about [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6928.72s)]
*  He's very loyal to the college that he graduated [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6930.72s)]
*  He gave massive amounts of money [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6932.72s)]
*  And donations which really helped [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6934.72s)]
*  People that he'll never get credit for [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6936.72s)]
*  He doesn't want the credit [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6938.72s)]
*  But I'm just saying, to imagine that nobody [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6940.72s)]
*  Spoke up for him all this time [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6942.72s)]
*  He should be the one suing them [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6944.72s)]
*  For breach of common [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6946.72s)]
*  He should be going after everything [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6948.72s)]
*  How are you possibly [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6950.72s)]
*  They've taken him off the website [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6952.72s)]
*  When I talk about cancelled, it's not that we don't assign him and put him back to work [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6954.72s)]
*  They've taken it like he doesn't exist [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6956.72s)]
*  He's pulling off the video games [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6958.72s)]
*  The DVDs that are out there, things are online [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6960.72s)]
*  His matches are gone [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6962.72s)]
*  Is he a sacrificial lamb so you don't go as hard at Vince [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6964.72s)]
*  And they can save some face and not have to oust their own father [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6966.72s)]
*  Do you think it could be something? [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6968.72s)]
*  I just think they gotta [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6970.72s)]
*  Oust the reputation [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6972.72s)]
*  Anything that falls in line with [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6974.72s)]
*  Workplace harassment or abuse [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6976.72s)]
*  You gotta get that out of there [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6978.72s)]
*  Or you're just doing like [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6980.72s)]
*  Yeah, you could be killing a story with another story [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6982.72s)]
*  Right, because I believe it's the same woman [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6984.72s)]
*  That's also accusing Vince [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6986.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6988.72s)]
*  It's the same woman [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6990.72s)]
*  Yes, but she has not come out [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6992.72s)]
*  She has not spoken up and said [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6994.72s)]
*  Bronco Lizard did these things [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6996.72s)]
*  She allegedly had told someone else [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=6998.72s)]
*  And then someone else had reported this to the media [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7000.72s)]
*  And it was just a phone number [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7002.72s)]
*  In fact, just to finish the story the way that it went [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7004.72s)]
*  But you know, Brock was escalating the text messages [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7006.72s)]
*  And they had planned to meet [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7008.72s)]
*  There was a hotel and there was a whole thing was planned [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7010.72s)]
*  And COVID hit [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7012.72s)]
*  And the travel never happened [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7014.72s)]
*  And they never met [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7016.72s)]
*  He's never met her [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7018.72s)]
*  He's never FaceTimed, he's never spoke [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7020.72s)]
*  She has nothing to tie this to Brock [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7022.72s)]
*  By the way, sure it could have been Brock [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7024.72s)]
*  I'm just talking about when you cancel a guy [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7026.72s)]
*  And you go against a contract [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7028.72s)]
*  A $30 million contract aside [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7030.72s)]
*  From destroying a guy's reputation [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7032.72s)]
*  And you did it on that [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7034.72s)]
*  You did it on hearsay [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7036.72s)]
*  That's never happened, that's all I'm suggesting [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7038.72s)]
*  From one person until right now [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7040.72s)]
*  To not come to the media and speak up on Brock's behalf [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7042.72s)]
*  Not one single friend he made in 20 years [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7044.72s)]
*  Maybe it was Vince [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7046.72s)]
*  Maybe it was Vince [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7048.72s)]
*  Talked to my girl [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7050.72s)]
*  I wonder if it was Vince [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7052.72s)]
*  Trying to poison the authority that's accusing him [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7054.72s)]
*  And saying like, look, this girl is accusing a lot of people [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7056.72s)]
*  She's calling everyone out [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7058.72s)]
*  She's obviously not a trustworthy source [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7060.72s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7062.72s)]
*  But I'm wondering if the fact that they're connected [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7064.72s)]
*  Seems suspicious to me [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7066.72s)]
*  Or, sorry to interrupt [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7068.72s)]
*  If she's fucking everybody [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7070.72s)]
*  She's not being abused by Vince [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7072.72s)]
*  It's the same thing we did with Kobe [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7074.72s)]
*  She has not claimed there was a crime [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7076.72s)]
*  She has not claimed there was a crime [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7078.72s)]
*  It wasn't [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7080.72s)]
*  Even if nobody knew one was being committed [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7082.72s)]
*  There is some crime [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7084.72s)]
*  There is some crime [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7086.72s)]
*  That you actually could tie Vince to [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7088.72s)]
*  And federal prosecutors allegedly looked at it [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7090.72s)]
*  Decided not to [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7092.72s)]
*  But when Brock was getting re-signed [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7094.72s)]
*  Vince, they have Vince's text to this girl [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7096.72s)]
*  And then they have these alleged texts from Brock [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7098.72s)]
*  The Vince's are Vince [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7100.72s)]
*  And the girl is the girl [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7102.72s)]
*  And Vince was saying to her, hey [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7104.72s)]
*  I'm doing a new deal with Brock [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7106.72s)]
*  You're part of the deal [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7108.72s)]
*  I have promised Brock you [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7110.72s)]
*  You need to reach out to him now [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7112.72s)]
*  And there was a re-negotiate [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7114.72s)]
*  And the timeline worked [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7116.72s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you have this random [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7118.72s)]
*  Unconfirmed number [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7120.72s)]
*  Sending some naughty messages [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7122.72s)]
*  Allegedly [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7124.72s)]
*  Sending some naughty messages [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7126.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, he didn't hide it [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7128.72s)]
*  Vince took a crap on her head [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7130.72s)]
*  Well [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7132.72s)]
*  Allegedly [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7134.72s)]
*  But not to not [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7136.72s)]
*  Sorry, that makes sense [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7138.72s)]
*  But [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7140.72s)]
*  It was like a group of guys [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7142.72s)]
*  There was like a group of guys [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7144.72s)]
*  In the hotel [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7146.72s)]
*  And it's unclear [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7148.72s)]
*  And I think he should only call her that [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7150.72s)]
*  When he refers her [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7152.72s)]
*  That's all he should ever refer to her as [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7154.72s)]
*  Yes, but here's what's unclear [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7156.72s)]
*  Was it an accident? [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7158.72s)]
*  That part that is [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7160.72s)]
*  Got in a weird position [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7162.72s)]
*  He's a thousand years old [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7164.72s)]
*  Oh, you're saying it was like 69 [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7166.72s)]
*  But he was on top [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7168.72s)]
*  There was a group that went after [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7170.72s)]
*  This had happened [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7172.72s)]
*  I don't know if they used a towel [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7174.72s)]
*  They didn't make it clear [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7176.72s)]
*  Yeah, who knows [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7178.72s)]
*  I really wish you would clear that up [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7180.72s)]
*  Do you think he was loosened up by somebody first? [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7182.72s)]
*  Gross [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7184.72s)]
*  I'm just like, you know [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7186.72s)]
*  This was very normal culture [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7188.72s)]
*  Shitting on women's heads [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7190.72s)]
*  The culture though [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7192.72s)]
*  That's going on [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7194.72s)]
*  They were discovering this and helping to set Vince up [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7196.72s)]
*  They're still there [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7198.72s)]
*  They were part of the culture [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7200.72s)]
*  There's still leadership [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7202.72s)]
*  It's one of these interesting things [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7204.72s)]
*  You put Brock down [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7206.72s)]
*  And you took the owner of the company [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7208.72s)]
*  This is what you love [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7210.72s)]
*  It's one way or the other [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7212.72s)]
*  Are we cleaning house or are we not? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7214.72s)]
*  Apparently Brock's text messages [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7216.72s)]
*  I don't want to out this too much [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7218.72s)]
*  This is from a website [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7220.72s)]
*  That I found on obscure website [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7222.72s)]
*  This is a video of herself urinating [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7224.72s)]
*  That's not even sex [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7226.72s)]
*  How embarrassing if you're Brock [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7228.72s)]
*  And that's the thing [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7230.72s)]
*  This is a bodily function [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7232.72s)]
*  That's straight up [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7234.72s)]
*  And after she did [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7236.72s)]
*  Allegedly he called her a bitch [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7238.72s)]
*  That makes my foot fetish less weird [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7240.72s)]
*  That's what this claims from the Wall Street Journal [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7242.72s)]
*  So she does send the video [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7244.72s)]
*  And he goes, you bitch [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7246.72s)]
*  Something like that [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7248.72s)]
*  That's what this is alleging [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7250.72s)]
*  The funniest way to respond [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7252.72s)]
*  To someone sending you [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7254.72s)]
*  It's a rough world [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7256.72s)]
*  She's like fine I'll do it for you bitch [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7258.72s)]
*  Too good [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7260.72s)]
*  If you're AEW why don't you just sign Brock [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7262.72s)]
*  He's a massive draw [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7264.72s)]
*  That's why it's good [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7266.72s)]
*  There's a second wrestling federation [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7268.72s)]
*  Or whatever it is [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7270.72s)]
*  Why doesn't AEW just scoop up Brock [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7272.72s)]
*  And really help with something [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7274.72s)]
*  I never even thought of that [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7276.72s)]
*  There would be an extent of that for sure [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7278.72s)]
*  For enough dates [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7280.72s)]
*  He's probably not going to do more than that [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7282.72s)]
*  I also wonder with the WWE [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7284.72s)]
*  They have cancelled them [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7286.72s)]
*  But are they still sending him money [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7288.72s)]
*  Is that why he's not going with AEW [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7290.72s)]
*  But it's a public company [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7292.72s)]
*  We could find that out [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7294.72s)]
*  Unless you're a girl peeing [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7296.72s)]
*  And then all of a sudden [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7298.72s)]
*  You can't get a hold of Brock [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7300.72s)]
*  You can't get a hold of Brock [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7302.72s)]
*  Yeah [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7304.72s)]
*  It's kind of a [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7306.72s)]
*  It's a little bit of an unbelievable story [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7308.72s)]
*  Whether you think that was Brock or not [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7310.72s)]
*  I actually don't choose to wait on that [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7312.72s)]
*  I tend to think it was [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7314.72s)]
*  What kind of evidence is that [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7316.72s)]
*  It's not cancelable [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7318.72s)]
*  With WWE it's like [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7320.72s)]
*  There are all these story lines that happen with the characters [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7322.72s)]
*  And you're like these story lines are just unbelievable [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7324.72s)]
*  Then you find out [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7328.72s)]
*  What's happening behind the scenes [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7330.72s)]
*  And it makes what's happening [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7332.72s)]
*  In front of the cameras so believable [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7334.72s)]
*  Well these guys like each other [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7336.72s)]
*  One guy hit another guy with a chair [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7338.72s)]
*  You don't like a girl and then shit on her head [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7340.72s)]
*  That actually does [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7342.72s)]
*  If that happened in an episode of Raw [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7344.72s)]
*  First of all [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7346.72s)]
*  There was another guy [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7348.72s)]
*  John Laurinaitis [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7350.72s)]
*  Very high ranking guy [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7352.72s)]
*  His son played in the NFL [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7354.72s)]
*  I think it might have been a nephew [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7356.72s)]
*  But they were the [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7358.72s)]
*  Road Warriors [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7360.72s)]
*  Road Warrior Animal is his brother [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7362.72s)]
*  Road Warrior Animal's son [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7364.72s)]
*  I believe played for [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7366.72s)]
*  The Rams might even still play [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7368.72s)]
*  Very good player [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7370.72s)]
*  And Laurinaitis has been [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7372.72s)]
*  He goes back to the 70s [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7374.72s)]
*  He's been around forever when his career was over [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7376.72s)]
*  He went into the office [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7378.72s)]
*  And he was part of like Vince really like during office hours [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7380.72s)]
*  For him and Laurinaitis to go into the woman's office [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7382.72s)]
*  Everybody's out here working [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7384.72s)]
*  Shut the door [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7386.72s)]
*  Everybody I'm just sharing that it was a cultural thing [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7388.72s)]
*  So Laurinaitis gets hit in this [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7390.72s)]
*  And Laurinaitis took a very interesting defense [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7392.72s)]
*  He lawyered up and he said I am a victim [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7394.72s)]
*  I too was paid by Vince [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7396.72s)]
*  And I too [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7398.72s)]
*  If I did not show up for these acts [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7400.72s)]
*  Whether I was the one doing this [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7402.72s)]
*  Or the one doing the I did not [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7404.72s)]
*  Fire [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7406.72s)]
*  It's kind of believable [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7408.72s)]
*  It's kind of believable [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7410.72s)]
*  I didn't want to fuck this hot girl we hired to fuck [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7412.72s)]
*  Yeah but I like doing it with Vince every time [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7414.72s)]
*  I'm doing it on my own accord [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7416.72s)]
*  The Bella Twins [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7418.72s)]
*  Oh yes [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7420.72s)]
*  Laurinaitis is the [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7422.72s)]
*  Stepfather to the Bella Twins [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7424.72s)]
*  He's very tied to this [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7426.72s)]
*  And he hasn't denied it [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7428.72s)]
*  Right during office hours [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7430.72s)]
*  Linda's walked in when Vince [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7432.72s)]
*  And finished [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7434.72s)]
*  She went to the filing cabinet and got it out [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7436.72s)]
*  As he's got [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7438.72s)]
*  I'm going back to the 80s and I don't even know the dude [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7440.72s)]
*  And I'm telling you stories [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7442.72s)]
*  I put her on my press cabinet [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7444.72s)]
*  Keep it secret [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7446.72s)]
*  Get some files out of it while I'm doing what I gotta do [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7448.72s)]
*  Now [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7450.72s)]
*  Now [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7452.72s)]
*  This is wild [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7454.72s)]
*  I will say the WWE [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7456.72s)]
*  Female wrestlers [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7458.72s)]
*  If you're judging by like [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7460.72s)]
*  Then and now [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7462.72s)]
*  Like China versus what they got now [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7464.72s)]
*  Which are these beautiful girls [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7466.72s)]
*  It would let you believe [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7468.72s)]
*  That you know [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7470.72s)]
*  That it's just [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7472.72s)]
*  Extracurricular activities happening [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7474.72s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7476.72s)]
*  You didn't want to crack China's history [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7478.72s)]
*  No, Tripp's was getting that [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7480.72s)]
*  It makes me believe Vince is out because now they look much less like dudes [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7482.72s)]
*  So you're fucking them [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7484.72s)]
*  We gotta know what this girl who's alleging [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7486.72s)]
*  Looks like, that's a good ass point though [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7488.72s)]
*  She's 40 by the way [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7490.72s)]
*  Which only surprised me, he's a much younger [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7492.72s)]
*  There's a lot of those divas [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7494.72s)]
*  That's surprising at least [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7496.72s)]
*  It's at least a little bit surprising [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7498.72s)]
*  When you find that part of it out [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7500.72s)]
*  But [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7502.72s)]
*  I lost my train of thought [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7504.72s)]
*  I think maybe even 42 [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7506.72s)]
*  I remember saying, what? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7508.72s)]
*  You remember that? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7510.72s)]
*  My father in law, Steve and I, we're watching this [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7512.72s)]
*  He took a dump on our head, we're giggling to each other [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7514.72s)]
*  And we're trying to speak in code [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7516.72s)]
*  Because my 8 year old son's in the back [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7518.72s)]
*  And we're trying to have this [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7520.72s)]
*  And then we find out she's 42 [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7522.72s)]
*  And we're like, it's typo [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7524.72s)]
*  You mean 24 [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7526.72s)]
*  Quite frankly, you know [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7528.72s)]
*  I think she looks closer to 24 [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7530.72s)]
*  But that's new Vince [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7532.72s)]
*  See that's not the dirtbag [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7534.72s)]
*  The new Vince with the mustache [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7536.72s)]
*  See he did not do anything wrong [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7538.72s)]
*  He looks so creepy [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7540.72s)]
*  No, this guy's innocent [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7542.72s)]
*  In fact, he looked back at that Vincent K. McMahon [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7544.72s)]
*  And thinks, what a dirtbag [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7546.72s)]
*  This is somebody else though [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7548.72s)]
*  He did this in front of the world [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7550.72s)]
*  He came out with a new look [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7552.72s)]
*  And a new catchphrase [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7554.72s)]
*  What was the new catchphrase? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7556.72s)]
*  I don't even know what it was [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7558.72s)]
*  He did it, he actually took on Pat McAfee [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7560.72s)]
*  At WrestleMania [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7562.72s)]
*  I've never seen Vince look so bad [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7564.72s)]
*  He ruined the show [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7566.72s)]
*  And Pat McAfee, who had never done it before [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7568.72s)]
*  Made the match work [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7570.72s)]
*  If you ever want to see Pat's true [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7572.72s)]
*  Wow skill, it was him versus Vince [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7574.72s)]
*  Vince couldn't move [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7576.72s)]
*  There was a time when Andre the Giant had to hold the rope [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7578.72s)]
*  Because he'd fall down [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7580.72s)]
*  He couldn't wrestle him, but they had to come over to him [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7582.72s)]
*  He couldn't let go of the rope [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7584.72s)]
*  Vince wasn't far off [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7586.72s)]
*  He was bad [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7588.72s)]
*  And Pat carried him [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7590.72s)]
*  Pat's got no experience [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7592.72s)]
*  And Pat carried him and made the match work [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7594.72s)]
*  Wait, was this past [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7596.72s)]
*  WrestleMania? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7598.72s)]
*  Yeah, that was two [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7600.72s)]
*  Vince is out for this one [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7602.72s)]
*  This was the first one with Tripp's [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7604.72s)]
*  I think I saw a couple people on Twitter [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7606.72s)]
*  Was looking at wrestling Twitter randomly [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7608.72s)]
*  To research a story [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7610.72s)]
*  But they seemed to really like Triple H [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7612.72s)]
*  They said, it's better off without Vince [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7614.72s)]
*  I noticed that people liked the new management [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7616.72s)]
*  They see Tripp's as a great executive [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7618.72s)]
*  That he's there, he's available [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7620.72s)]
*  He understands things [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7622.72s)]
*  If he gives you an answer, you can count on it [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7624.72s)]
*  They came out to Portland just recently [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7626.72s)]
*  I worked with the commission, so we were there before anybody else [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7628.72s)]
*  And Tripp's was there [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7630.72s)]
*  When the guys were in the ring early [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7632.72s)]
*  Going over to their spots [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7634.72s)]
*  They have a meal before they change [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7636.72s)]
*  There was no other executives there [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7638.72s)]
*  And there's Tripp's [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7640.72s)]
*  He's with the boys [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7642.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think that Tripp's [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7644.72s)]
*  I think he really likes what he does [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7646.72s)]
*  And I think he must be pretty damn good [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7648.72s)]
*  Because that's a competitive business [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7650.72s)]
*  It takes a lot [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7652.72s)]
*  The idea of replacing Dana [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7654.72s)]
*  Is not something that... I haven't met the person [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7656.72s)]
*  I haven't met the person because [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7658.72s)]
*  They can't put in the time [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7660.72s)]
*  They're not going to go 7 days a week, 18 hours a day [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7662.72s)]
*  They're not, they're going to require as humans [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7664.72s)]
*  More sleep than Dana does [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7666.72s)]
*  And the same could really be said for Vince [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7668.72s)]
*  Vince would fire somebody if they yawned [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7670.72s)]
*  He couldn't understand [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7672.72s)]
*  He couldn't understand why somebody needed sleep [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7674.72s)]
*  He didn't know why he needed sleep [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7676.72s)]
*  It infuriated him [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7678.72s)]
*  Why? Why would God make... Why do we need to sleep? [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7680.72s)]
*  And if somebody would yawn in a meeting [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7682.72s)]
*  It's at like 3am [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7684.72s)]
*  He's tired of making money [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7686.72s)]
*  He'd turn on them [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7688.72s)]
*  It was legit, he didn't understand [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7690.72s)]
*  It does make sense though that he took a popular figure [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7692.72s)]
*  From wrestling to replace him [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7694.72s)]
*  Because as the owner of the business [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7696.72s)]
*  You also need to be a personality that represents the business [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7700.72s)]
*  And I think that's something that [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7702.72s)]
*  People probably underestimate with Dana [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7704.72s)]
*  Dana is a personality [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7706.72s)]
*  He can be the face of the business [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7708.72s)]
*  He is the celebrity CEO if you will [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7710.72s)]
*  And he needs to be able to do a podcast [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7712.72s)]
*  With people for hours [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7714.72s)]
*  And answer questions and be entertaining [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7716.72s)]
*  And go up and talk to media [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7718.72s)]
*  Triple H can do that [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7720.72s)]
*  Because he spent decades in the spotlight [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7722.72s)]
*  Honing that skill [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7724.72s)]
*  And that craft [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7726.72s)]
*  You can just hire some geek [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7728.72s)]
*  Someone who would run a basketball team [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7730.72s)]
*  Or something like that [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7732.72s)]
*  They can do it behind the scenes [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7734.72s)]
*  They can look at the X and the Z and the O [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7736.72s)]
*  But they can't be that personality [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7738.72s)]
*  100% [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7740.72s)]
*  Like there's other guys that can do the paperwork [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7742.72s)]
*  But to come out and be a promoter [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7744.72s)]
*  That shit is hard [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7746.72s)]
*  Even Don King [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7748.72s)]
*  He was being silly [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7750.72s)]
*  He was out there with the fucking flags [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7752.72s)]
*  It was short, he couldn't sit down in a podcast for me [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7754.72s)]
*  And it worked for many years [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7756.72s)]
*  It took a long time [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7758.72s)]
*  Bob Arum never got it [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7760.72s)]
*  Eddie Hearn does to a degree [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7762.72s)]
*  But they're still following him [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7764.72s)]
*  I feel like Dan LaHoy is flirting with it now [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7766.72s)]
*  He realizes how people see him [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7768.72s)]
*  And he's kind of talking about his past [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7770.72s)]
*  And kind of talking about what he went through [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7772.72s)]
*  I feel like he's not trying to uphold the golden boy image [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7774.72s)]
*  He's like, okay, that's done [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7776.72s)]
*  Now everybody knows that I was a degenerate cocaine addict [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7778.72s)]
*  That loved fucking [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7780.72s)]
*  And I could also beat people up [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7782.72s)]
*  And I could also beat people up [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7784.72s)]
*  Alright [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7786.72s)]
*  I feel like he's almost [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7788.72s)]
*  He had a moment with Canelo [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7790.72s)]
*  In promoting Canelo's last fight [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7792.72s)]
*  I guess he was also the promoter of the guy who was fighting Canelo [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7794.72s)]
*  Where Canelo started cursing at him and stuff like that [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7796.72s)]
*  And I was like, oh, are you getting this? [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7798.72s)]
*  Nobody knows who this fighter that you represent is [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7800.72s)]
*  But Canelo is now fighting with you [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7802.72s)]
*  So I wonder if Oscar is [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7804.72s)]
*  And Ryan Garcia has also turned on Oscar [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7806.72s)]
*  You saw that miniseries they met on Oscar [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7808.72s)]
*  It was a big hit [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7810.72s)]
*  You saw that miniseries they met on Oscar [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7812.72s)]
*  It was a true story, like Oscar helped them with it [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7814.72s)]
*  But we were so close [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7816.72s)]
*  We were so close to getting there [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7818.72s)]
*  He revealed to the world what a scumbag he is [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7820.72s)]
*  Which can be a really good counseling session [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7822.72s)]
*  And we were so close to this actually helping [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7824.72s)]
*  And right at the end, one of the last things he says [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7826.72s)]
*  Is he goes, you know, I looked back [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7828.72s)]
*  All the bad things, terrible father, didn't see his kids [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7830.72s)]
*  I mean, the worst things you could do [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7832.72s)]
*  And says, you know, but I wonder [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7834.72s)]
*  If it was wrong, maybe it was all worth it [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7836.72s)]
*  To get us here, because we're all so [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7838.72s)]
*  Happy and successful, whatever it was [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7840.72s)]
*  He didn't take any responsibility [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7842.72s)]
*  All he had to do was out himself [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7844.72s)]
*  Tell the truth and then take responsibility [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7846.72s)]
*  Almost wonderless [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7848.72s)]
*  He was so close [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7850.72s)]
*  Have you ever met Vince or any of these big wrestlers? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7852.72s)]
*  No [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7854.72s)]
*  Stone Cold comes to some of the events [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7856.72s)]
*  The Rock comes to the events [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7858.72s)]
*  I've actually never met him, I've walked past him [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7860.72s)]
*  He's been at our fights, I've walked past him, but never met him [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7862.72s)]
*  I got to go to a [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7864.72s)]
*  WrestleMania after party once [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7866.72s)]
*  And so I met real quickly [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7868.72s)]
*  But Bret Hart was there, Roman Reigns was there [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7870.72s)]
*  John Cena was there [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7872.72s)]
*  Randy Orton was the nicest guy [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7874.72s)]
*  Randy Orton was the cool guy [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7876.72s)]
*  He was on the dance floor, man [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7878.72s)]
*  He was cutting a rug all night [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7880.72s)]
*  Orton was great [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7882.72s)]
*  Pastor Kishi and some other [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7884.72s)]
*  They don't know us though [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7886.72s)]
*  It's not the same thing, like where I knew each [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7888.72s)]
*  And every one of these guys, and remember them to this day [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7890.72s)]
*  And remember the brief interaction I had [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7892.72s)]
*  Even if it was just, hello [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7894.72s)]
*  It's not the same [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7896.72s)]
*  Who's the greatest of all time? [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7898.72s)]
*  Professional wrestler? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7900.72s)]
*  Well, I believe in professional wrestling [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7902.72s)]
*  Whoever made the most money is the best [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7904.72s)]
*  And that's Hulk Hogan [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7906.72s)]
*  And they said that he didn't know the difference between [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7908.72s)]
*  A wrist lock and a wrist watch [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7910.72s)]
*  That he was going to hit you with the right hand [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7912.72s)]
*  And drop that leg [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7914.72s)]
*  He was never going to hit actual wrestling moves or anything hard [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7916.72s)]
*  That's what they said [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7918.72s)]
*  But I like the guys that brawled [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7920.72s)]
*  I like wrestling back when it looked like a competition [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7922.72s)]
*  Now it looks like a performance [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7924.72s)]
*  It looks like a cooperation that's a performance [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7926.72s)]
*  I don't like that [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7928.72s)]
*  I don't like triple backflips off the [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7930.72s)]
*  Into the tables [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7932.72s)]
*  And things like this [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7934.72s)]
*  I think it's weird, I liked it back when it was a fight [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7936.72s)]
*  I liked that Hogan threw right hands and moves [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7938.72s)]
*  That if you were in a fight you would actually use [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7940.72s)]
*  Pick a guy up and throw him down [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7942.72s)]
*  And then kick him while he's down [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7944.72s)]
*  I like those things [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7946.72s)]
*  I say Hogan, if you want to know the absolute best technician [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7948.72s)]
*  Boy, they got a guy right now [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7950.72s)]
*  Seth Rollins [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7952.72s)]
*  For Seth to be number one [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7954.72s)]
*  He's got to be better than Bretard, he's got to be better than Shawn Michaels [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7956.72s)]
*  Which he might not be [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7958.72s)]
*  Those guys were good [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7960.72s)]
*  But he also might be [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7962.72s)]
*  Seth might be number one [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7964.72s)]
*  He is an incredible athlete [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7966.72s)]
*  He could have gone into anything and done very well [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7968.72s)]
*  He just somehow found wrestling [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7970.72s)]
*  But I think that it's important that you look at it from that perspective [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7972.72s)]
*  And it might sound silly [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7974.72s)]
*  The guy that made the most money [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7976.72s)]
*  No, it's not real [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7978.72s)]
*  But wouldn't it be the Rock? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7980.72s)]
*  Wouldn't it be the Rock that made the most money? [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7982.72s)]
*  Well, and now, yeah, that's right [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7984.72s)]
*  I would imagine the Rocks come on [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7986.72s)]
*  They say Stone Cold just on his merchandise [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7988.72s)]
*  They say that [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7990.72s)]
*  And Hogan didn't really have a chance [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7992.72s)]
*  By the way [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7994.72s)]
*  Not everything was pay-per-view [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7996.72s)]
*  They had closed caption [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=7998.72s)]
*  Vince was the first one to the WrestleMania to bring that out [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8000.72s)]
*  So I'm just saying, like his whole era [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8002.72s)]
*  Muhammad Ali, by example, has no records [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8004.72s)]
*  They also didn't have pay-per-view back then [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8006.72s)]
*  It's not as though pay-per-views beat him [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8008.72s)]
*  It didn't exist back then [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8010.72s)]
*  You watched Muhammad Ali fight by [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8012.72s)]
*  Gathering around a transistor radio [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8014.72s)]
*  It was just a very different time [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8016.72s)]
*  So, yeah, you could be right [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8018.72s)]
*  That the Rock has passed him up [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8020.72s)]
*  I would think that is correct [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8022.72s)]
*  I wonder how that worked out [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8024.72s)]
*  When they did those fights abroad [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8026.72s)]
*  The gate can't be worth much [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8028.72s)]
*  Right? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8030.72s)]
*  Because you're fighting in the third world country [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8032.72s)]
*  You can't charge that much money for tickets [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8034.72s)]
*  Or else who's going to show up? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8036.72s)]
*  And the exchange rate is dog shit [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8038.72s)]
*  I guess, what was it? [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8040.72s)]
*  It must have been TV rights that paid the fighters [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8042.72s)]
*  Had to have been [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8044.72s)]
*  Had to be [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8046.72s)]
*  So it's distribution and everybody's just watching on NBC [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8048.72s)]
*  Or wherever the hell they're watching it [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8050.72s)]
*  Got it, and I'm sure there were some sponsors for the events [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8052.72s)]
*  And then the fighters, I imagine, just weren't making the type of money that the fighters had [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8054.72s)]
*  I don't think they understood [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8058.72s)]
*  Again, bringing to NFL, which is what I know [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8060.72s)]
*  The NFL just had a deal with CBS to broadcast the games [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8062.72s)]
*  And then Jerry Jones actually was the guy that was like [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8064.72s)]
*  No, we can shop this around and make a lot more money [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8066.72s)]
*  And that's how the money has gotten crazy in NFL and NBA [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8068.72s)]
*  TV rights [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8070.72s)]
*  So shop it, this is a bidding war now [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8072.72s)]
*  Distribution is a very hard business to know [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8074.72s)]
*  There's not a lot of people, there's not even a lot of books on it [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8076.72s)]
*  But even the UFC that sold ESPN for 1.5 billion [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8078.72s)]
*  That all got announced and was public [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8080.72s)]
*  But if you look a little closer [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8082.72s)]
*  That was a North American deal [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8084.72s)]
*  If ESPN in Mexico wants to show [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8086.72s)]
*  It's a whole other feat [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8088.72s)]
*  Or if Dana wants to take it and sell it to somebody [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8090.72s)]
*  Or if Dana wants to take it and sell it to somebody that isn't ESPN [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8092.72s)]
*  And he wants to do that in Germany or Switzerland [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8094.72s)]
*  So he maintained the international rights for it [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8096.72s)]
*  Yeah, so all of a sudden [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8098.72s)]
*  You get these places that come out and brag [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8100.72s)]
*  PFL and Don Davis were very excited [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8102.72s)]
*  They're like, we're in 68 different countries [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8104.72s)]
*  But that's a really big deal [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8106.72s)]
*  Because it's 68 different deal [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8108.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know a lot about that [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8110.72s)]
*  And I don't know anybody I can call and ask [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8112.72s)]
*  I don't have any friends, I don't have any family [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8114.72s)]
*  There's not really anybody out there where you can [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8116.72s)]
*  You can learn about that [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8118.72s)]
*  That's where the real competitive part of the business comes [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8120.72s)]
*  Then if you're in pay-per-view [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8122.72s)]
*  The theft rate right now is so high [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8124.72s)]
*  You really can't do a pay-per-view [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8126.72s)]
*  People downloading illegally [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8128.72s)]
*  Showing it on TikTok, having certain websites [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8130.72s)]
*  You can go to [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8132.72s)]
*  So Dana's got this infrastructure [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8134.72s)]
*  Just outing myself [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8136.72s)]
*  I don't pay for pay-per-views [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8138.72s)]
*  Hey, you know, it's one of those things [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8140.72s)]
*  If we met at the fire, I'll pay [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8142.72s)]
*  And if we haven't, eh [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8144.72s)]
*  No, I have to every single time [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8146.72s)]
*  That shit is too crazy [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8148.72s)]
*  I was in France for [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8150.72s)]
*  What do you think we, what a [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8152.72s)]
*  What a performance [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8154.72s)]
*  Thank you for calling about it [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8156.72s)]
*  Thank you for calling about it [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8158.72s)]
*  He saw the warning by the FBI [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8160.72s)]
*  At the end of the show for 250,000 [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8162.72s)]
*  Let me try again [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8164.72s)]
*  Do you know what those guys go through in there? [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8168.72s)]
*  They go through [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8172.72s)]
*  Hold on, let me get both of these out [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8174.72s)]
*  Yeah, I just can't [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8176.72s)]
*  I can't steal it [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8178.72s)]
*  I mean, those guys, they're getting [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8180.72s)]
*  Punched and kicked and choked [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8182.72s)]
*  Something would happen at a WWE office [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8184.72s)]
*  I mean [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8186.72s)]
*  What is [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8188.72s)]
*  What does one cost? [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8190.72s)]
*  What pay-per-view? The ones that you buy every time [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8192.720000000001s)]
*  I think they're about $25 now, aren't they? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8194.720000000001s)]
*  Got to buy every single one [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8196.720000000001s)]
*  I feel like we got one more [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8198.720000000001s)]
*  Let's take one more on that [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8200.720000000001s)]
*  Or can you do that through your remote control? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8202.720000000001s)]
*  I can do that right through the remote [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8204.72s)]
*  I can watch it on my Nintendo Switch [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8206.72s)]
*  Everyone else has to go to the dot com [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8208.72s)]
*  Special remote? [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8210.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a special remote [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8212.72s)]
*  I feel like when a guy is willing to sacrifice [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8214.72s)]
*  That much and be in that thing [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8216.72s)]
*  And if you don't, you're taking [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8218.72s)]
*  He's giving up his life, the least you can do [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8220.72s)]
*  Is give him a few dollars [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8222.72s)]
*  And if you do get it wrong [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8224.72s)]
*  You get a teleportation advice, you go back in time [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8226.72s)]
*  And if you believe that, you must be kind of stupid [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8228.72s)]
*  By the way, I was going to ask you one simple question [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8230.72s)]
*  Are you getting to the position [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8232.72s)]
*  With this show [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8234.72s)]
*  Where people are beginning to kiss the ring [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8236.72s)]
*  And I'm talking about [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8238.72s)]
*  To use Rogan, but politicians [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8240.72s)]
*  Aspiring politicians are calling and trying to get on the Joe Rogan show [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8242.72s)]
*  Are you having to deal with that? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8244.72s)]
*  And if so, okay [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8246.72s)]
*  Do you have a policy [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8248.72s)]
*  You're supposed to say, we're not doing this or I'm not doing that [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8250.72s)]
*  Or if I have this one, then I'll have this one [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8252.72s)]
*  It's just am I interested [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8254.72s)]
*  Who do I think is interested? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8256.72s)]
*  Who do I think is interested? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8258.72s)]
*  Who's interesting, who's like [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8260.72s)]
*  Because there's no other way to have a conversation, right? [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8262.72s)]
*  And if [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8264.72s)]
*  Like for me, I think it's interesting [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8266.72s)]
*  We had a couple guys that ran [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8268.72s)]
*  We had RFK, and then we had Vivek [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8270.72s)]
*  And I was interested in both of them [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8272.72s)]
*  Vivek had withdrawn by the time we had him on [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8274.72s)]
*  We were at least in conversation [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8276.72s)]
*  While he was still going [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8278.72s)]
*  I think we were the first interview after he withdrew [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8280.72s)]
*  But I was like, I want to know what it's like [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8282.72s)]
*  Why would you make the decision [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8284.72s)]
*  To run for president? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8286.72s)]
*  I want to know what's going on in your head [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8288.72s)]
*  You don't have to, you have all the money in the world [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8290.72s)]
*  You have a family, your family's going to go through hell [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8292.72s)]
*  Why do you think this needs to happen? [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8294.72s)]
*  What did he say, by the way? [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8296.72s)]
*  He truly believes that he can make a difference [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8298.72s)]
*  He can, by the way [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8300.72s)]
*  He actually can [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8302.72s)]
*  He was fucking unbelievable [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8304.72s)]
*  I just think he cannot communicate to people [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8306.72s)]
*  He tries to dumb it down [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8308.72s)]
*  And he dumbs it down too much [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8310.72s)]
*  And then I think we're like, fuck you talking about [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8312.72s)]
*  I also think that there are some extreme things in his beliefs [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8314.72s)]
*  That he's willing to pay the price for [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8318.72s)]
*  I don't know if Americans are [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8322.72s)]
*  He was bringing up something I think [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8324.72s)]
*  I don't know if it was Jefferson [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8326.72s)]
*  Said about [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8328.72s)]
*  The people deserve a country [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8330.72s)]
*  Democracy ensures that the people get a country they deserve [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8334.72s)]
*  And I'm probably butchering that quote [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8340.72s)]
*  People deserve meaning like if we get rid of a lot of fucked up shit [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8342.72s)]
*  And people's lives are impacted negatively because of that [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8344.72s)]
*  If we get rid of these government programs that we think are bloated and they probably are [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8348.72s)]
*  But people's lives are impacted negatively [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8352.72s)]
*  He's like, we deserve that [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8354.72s)]
*  And I don't know if the average American is willing to take that on [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8356.72s)]
*  Maybe they are [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8362.72s)]
*  Maybe they're not [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8364.72s)]
*  But I thought he had a unique way of looking through things [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8366.72s)]
*  And I thought it was kind of cool [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8368.72s)]
*  I thought it was great [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8370.72s)]
*  He really impressed me [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8372.72s)]
*  And by the way, I feel as though he's going to pull out [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8374.72s)]
*  Because he will be the decision maker one way or the other [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8376.72s)]
*  I feel like he's going to pull it [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8378.72s)]
*  Do you believe after meeting him that he is the resolve [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8380.72s)]
*  To stay [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8382.72s)]
*  Because both sides are trying to make deals right now [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8384.72s)]
*  Right now these deals are coming in [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8386.72s)]
*  And they're big ones too [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8388.72s)]
*  What do you mean by resolve? What does that mean? Like to stay in? Like is it the integrity? [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8390.72s)]
*  I'll give you an example [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8392.72s)]
*  We just saw this with Kerry Lake [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8394.72s)]
*  But the people that are supporting Biden and think that he's going to be harmful [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8396.72s)]
*  And they're already calling and offering RFK a seat on the board [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8398.72s)]
*  Which is no different than 100BITEN selling a painting for $10 million [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8400.72s)]
*  Which is no different than 100BITEN selling a painting for $10 million [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8402.72s)]
*  Which is no different than 100BITEN selling a painting for $10 million [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8404.72s)]
*  It's the exact same thing but I'm just sharing with you [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8406.72s)]
*  Does he have the resolve to stay in this to the bitter end [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8408.72s)]
*  Or is he going to jump and exchange [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8410.72s)]
*  For the buyout [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8412.72s)]
*  I don't think that you can influence him as easily with money [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8414.72s)]
*  I don't think that you can influence him as easily with money [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8416.72s)]
*  Like this guy's a Kennedy [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8418.72s)]
*  He's been around money his entire life [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8420.72s)]
*  Money is not impressive to him [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8422.72s)]
*  Like it was funny when he was talking about hanging out with [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8424.72s)]
*  Epstein [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8426.72s)]
*  I was like how's the jet [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8428.72s)]
*  And he was like it was alright [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8430.72s)]
*  But like he didn't say it as a joke [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8432.72s)]
*  He objectively judged the jet [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8434.72s)]
*  Which to us is like [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8436.72s)]
*  What? [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8438.72s)]
*  There's more than one [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8440.72s)]
*  I thought it was just Delta and then private play [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8442.72s)]
*  There's a lot of them apparently [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8444.72s)]
*  So I don't think you can bribe him with money [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8446.72s)]
*  So I don't think you can bribe him with money [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8448.72s)]
*  I think that he [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8450.72s)]
*  I mean look maybe everybody has a price [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8452.72s)]
*  Like a billion dollars I don't know but his price is obviously going to be much higher [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8454.72s)]
*  Sure [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8456.72s)]
*  And I think he really kind of likes nature [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8458.72s)]
*  That's his thing a little bit [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8460.72s)]
*  Maybe that identity is curated by like [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8462.72s)]
*  Working for these environmental agencies [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8464.72s)]
*  Or whatever he's done [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8466.72s)]
*  So I think it's going to be [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8468.72s)]
*  What are you going to give him that he really wants [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8470.72s)]
*  When he came and saw you guys [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8472.72s)]
*  Did he have security [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8474.72s)]
*  Are you planning something [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8476.72s)]
*  Let's go back to the beginning of this episode [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8478.72s)]
*  If I was to shoot I would go [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8480.72s)]
*  You can't wait until the car turns [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8482.72s)]
*  I thought that was very low [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8484.72s)]
*  That they didn't give him security [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8486.72s)]
*  That was very low and when I talk about will he have the resolve [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8488.72s)]
*  To stay in it's like well he just might because [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8490.72s)]
*  They've done so many terrible things to him [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8492.72s)]
*  From what Nancy Pelosi did to him [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8494.72s)]
*  To the demisal by Joe Biden [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8496.72s)]
*  To putting his security in harm by not giving him [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8498.72s)]
*  That alone could piss him aloft [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8500.72s)]
*  But now he has the money [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8502.72s)]
*  I think the girl that's running with him [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8504.72s)]
*  Is the wife of the founder of Google [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8506.72s)]
*  Or something like that [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8508.72s)]
*  He's picked a running mate huh? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8510.72s)]
*  She's got deep pockets [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8512.72s)]
*  I don't know if that's strategic [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8514.72s)]
*  But he's good for security [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8516.72s)]
*  They're playing this game by the way of who's going to be [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8518.72s)]
*  Trump's running mate [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8520.72s)]
*  Do you guys want me to ruin this for you? [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8522.72s)]
*  So this is what's fascinating [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8524.72s)]
*  If he chooses [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8526.72s)]
*  Mike Pompeo [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8528.72s)]
*  Mike Pompeo was the [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8530.72s)]
*  What's it called? Secretary of State [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8532.72s)]
*  Right? [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8534.72s)]
*  If he chooses [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8536.72s)]
*  If he chooses Mike Pompeo [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8538.72s)]
*  I think that [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8540.72s)]
*  All of the [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8542.72s)]
*  Drain the swamp Republicans [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8544.72s)]
*  The right wing drain the swamp guys [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8546.72s)]
*  That are like [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8548.72s)]
*  Oh Trump's going to come here and change everything [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8550.72s)]
*  If you choose a true establishment [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8552.72s)]
*  Politician [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8554.72s)]
*  Figure like Mike Pompeo [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8556.72s)]
*  I think you break the hearts of all the fringe groups [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8558.72s)]
*  Now they might not vote for Biden [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8560.72s)]
*  But I don't know if they'll support Trump [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8562.72s)]
*  But what I think it does is by choosing Pompeo [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8564.72s)]
*  I think it brings over [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8566.72s)]
*  Neutral [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8568.72s)]
*  Democrats [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8570.72s)]
*  It's basically Trump going [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8572.72s)]
*  Hey guys I'm not going to shake shit up [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8574.72s)]
*  I'm going to do the same thing I did last time [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8576.72s)]
*  Where I hire all the establishment [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8578.72s)]
*  People to be in my cabinet [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8580.72s)]
*  In the positions of power [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8582.72s)]
*  And I do things a little different [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8584.72s)]
*  I say things a little wild [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8586.72s)]
*  And maybe other countries aren't as comfortable bombing [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8588.72s)]
*  Because they think I'm a loose cannon [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8590.72s)]
*  But I'm still going [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8592.72s)]
*  Do you think that's what that is? [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8594.72s)]
*  Mike Pompeo is as establishment as it gets [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8596.72s)]
*  I can tell you this [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8598.72s)]
*  When Trump made a statement [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8600.72s)]
*  He's now playing the game [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8602.72s)]
*  But he didn't play it at first [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8604.72s)]
*  And see who can go out there [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8606.72s)]
*  Work the hardest and get all these things [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8608.72s)]
*  He didn't do that [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8610.72s)]
*  He corrected himself [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8612.72s)]
*  30% I do [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8614.72s)]
*  I can tell you in that moment [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8616.72s)]
*  He was referring to Mike Pompeo [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8618.72s)]
*  How do you know that? [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8620.72s)]
*  How do I not? [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8622.72s)]
*  I'm sharing something with you guys [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8624.72s)]
*  I'm sharing some insight [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8626.72s)]
*  You want to have a kiss and tell? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8628.72s)]
*  That's not like some glamorous [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8630.72s)]
*  Dana White would have been a hot spot [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8632.72s)]
*  I'm just getting in front of it [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8634.72s)]
*  Just so you know [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8636.72s)]
*  If you're wondering why Pompeo [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8638.72s)]
*  Pulled out of the race when Trump got in [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8640.72s)]
*  It wasn't just respect and honor [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8642.72s)]
*  He does very much [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8644.72s)]
*  If you're wondering why Pompeo has been so quiet [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8646.72s)]
*  It's not because he's out of the game [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8648.72s)]
*  I'm letting you know [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8650.72s)]
*  When he made the statement of 30% [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8652.72s)]
*  He was referring to Mike Pompeo [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8654.72s)]
*  I really thought it was going to be Nikki Haley [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8656.72s)]
*  She pulled back her words [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8658.72s)]
*  Interesting [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8660.72s)]
*  Who would you possibly need her for? [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8662.72s)]
*  To get the other half of the party [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8664.72s)]
*  That was anybody but Trump [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8666.72s)]
*  The public is falling in line [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8668.72s)]
*  You just need friends [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8670.72s)]
*  That's what I was thinking about, fringer groups [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8672.72s)]
*  What about Tulsi Gabbard? [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8674.72s)]
*  I like her, I don't like Nikki Haley [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8676.72s)]
*  Don't forget that [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8678.72s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a better Indian than Nikki Haley [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8680.72s)]
*  I'm not even Indian [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8682.72s)]
*  Is Nikki Haley not Indian? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8684.72s)]
*  Nikki is, but Tulsi Gabbard is a better Indian [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8686.72s)]
*  She's Hawaiian [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8688.72s)]
*  I'm trying to think [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8690.72s)]
*  What do we got here? [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8692.72s)]
*  I just don't know that Nikki would offer them [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8694.72s)]
*  There was a poll that came out yesterday [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8696.72s)]
*  54% of Democrats would rather somebody else [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8698.72s)]
*  Other than Biden, but that's just something they say [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8700.72s)]
*  If that was sincere at all [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8702.72s)]
*  Ask them one follow up question, who? [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8704.72s)]
*  I think it's those Dems that blows in the wind [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8706.72s)]
*  And makes us say, who? [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8708.72s)]
*  If they say Gretchen [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8710.72s)]
*  If they say Gabbard [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8712.72s)]
*  Then they do mean it [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8714.72s)]
*  They're just saying, they're just words [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8716.72s)]
*  What about pulling [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8718.72s)]
*  There's reason to believe that [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8720.72s)]
*  Biden will be pulled [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8722.72s)]
*  What do you think? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8724.72s)]
*  He most definitely will not be [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8726.72s)]
*  And I'm not sure why play that game [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8728.72s)]
*  But it is a game [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8730.72s)]
*  The Democrats are the ones allowing that story to be out there [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8732.72s)]
*  And it just seems like they're not piling up [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8734.72s)]
*  And putting everything on Biden [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8736.72s)]
*  They're throwing just enough on Newsome [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8738.72s)]
*  I feel like the Republicans are falling [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8740.72s)]
*  For it [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8742.72s)]
*  Oh, so it's a tactic [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8744.72s)]
*  Oh yes, yes, very much [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8746.72s)]
*  They're throwing just enough behind [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8748.72s)]
*  Wow, we can't have that Kamal Harris [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8750.72s)]
*  That Gretchen, she had Michigan, she stood in a bad job [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8752.72s)]
*  The Republicans are falling [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8754.72s)]
*  For what they want to do [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8756.72s)]
*  What does that tactic do? [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8758.72s)]
*  It would just take your focus off of Biden [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8760.72s)]
*  And all the negative things that you come out there and say [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8762.72s)]
*  Which is a miss in politics anyway [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8764.72s)]
*  If you're team Trump [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8766.72s)]
*  You should never say Joe Biden's name [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8768.72s)]
*  Which is, there's not a politician out there [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8770.72s)]
*  That would agree with me, and I do mean zero [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8772.72s)]
*  But they should never say Joe's name [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8774.72s)]
*  They should only tell you what's great about Trump [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8776.72s)]
*  What about Crooked Joe [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8778.72s)]
*  What about, what was it [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8780.72s)]
*  Crooked Hillary, all the [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8782.72s)]
*  Sayings that he [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8784.72s)]
*  All the sayings that he curated were fantastic [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8786.72s)]
*  Some of that's fun [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8788.72s)]
*  I'm just sharing with you, it's a really big mistake [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8790.72s)]
*  When they go out there and they've got TV time to put Trump over [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8792.72s)]
*  And they spend 80% of it talking about Biden [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8794.72s)]
*  They're doing it from a negative standpoint [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8796.72s)]
*  Which they think builds Trump up [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8798.72s)]
*  You guys got this wrong [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8800.72s)]
*  You're not talking about Trump himself [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8802.72s)]
*  Should Trump himself talk about [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8804.72s)]
*  Well, he can deal with the issues [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8806.72s)]
*  But no, not the way that he does [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8808.72s)]
*  It's a broad stroke when I say never, but no [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8810.72s)]
*  You should not, nobody else does [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8812.72s)]
*  You're a comedian or something, you're trying to get in front of somebody else [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8814.72s)]
*  You would never start talking about [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8816.72s)]
*  You could also come to Madison Square Garden and start putting it down [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8818.72s)]
*  Nobody would do that [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8820.72s)]
*  No actor that ever made it to the top [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8822.72s)]
*  No singer that made it to the top [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8824.72s)]
*  Nobody comes out and does that [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8826.72s)]
*  It's being debunked a bit, even in comedy [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8828.72s)]
*  Cat Williams went on Shannon Sharpe's podcast [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8830.72s)]
*  Trashed so many other comedians [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8832.72s)]
*  That was fun [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8834.72s)]
*  It was riveting [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8836.72s)]
*  But it also kind of revived things for Cat [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8838.72s)]
*  Sure did [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8840.72s)]
*  And then the entire Democratic ticket [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8842.72s)]
*  In 2020 was we can't have Trump [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8844.72s)]
*  That's all they have even now [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8846.72s)]
*  We just can't have Trump [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8848.72s)]
*  So who do you think wins? [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8850.72s)]
*  Well, you're going to have a very hard time beating Biden [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8852.72s)]
*  You're going to have a very hard time [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8854.72s)]
*  He's a very good politician [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8856.72s)]
*  And I've never seen anything like it [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8858.72s)]
*  I was telling you earlier that I was so surprised to see my own colleague Stephen A. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8860.72s)]
*  Wilt so quickly [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8862.72s)]
*  And openly admit [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8864.72s)]
*  I am wilting because of your comments on social media [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8866.72s)]
*  He was the tough guy in the room [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8868.72s)]
*  And he was the tough guy in the room [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8870.72s)]
*  And he was the tough guy in the room [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8872.72s)]
*  He was the tough guy in the room [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8874.72s)]
*  And I was just surprised [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8876.72s)]
*  Joe Biden is the only [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8878.72s)]
*  Politician I've seen [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8880.72s)]
*  That will come out and say I don't believe [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8882.72s)]
*  In this, my convictions are [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8884.72s)]
*  A different way, I'm not going to bring my beliefs [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8886.72s)]
*  And my convictions, here's what I will [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8888.72s)]
*  Vote when it's time to vote because I know that's [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8890.72s)]
*  What the majority of you want [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8892.72s)]
*  And he'll even go that way [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8894.72s)]
*  Until it's not popular and then he'll do an interview [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8896.72s)]
*  And he'll say hey listen, this is no longer popular [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8898.72s)]
*  You guys want to see this [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8900.72s)]
*  I'm going to vote for you [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8902.72s)]
*  I'm going to vote for you [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8904.72s)]
*  I'm going to vote for you [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8906.72s)]

*  When you're saying people like that, that's what makes him a good politician. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8986.72s)]
*  No, I'm just saying it's very unique. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8988.72s)]
*  I can't think of anybody else [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8990.72s)]
*  that when you vote for a man to be your leader [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8992.72s)]
*  it's because you like his convictions. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8994.72s)]
*  He has convinced you, I know a better way. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8996.72s)]
*  I've led a better life. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=8998.72s)]
*  I can bring this to you. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9000.72s)]
*  That's what a leader is. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9002.72s)]
*  I've never seen anybody [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9004.72s)]
*  against church and state. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9006.72s)]
*  You don't want his religious beliefs [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9008.72s)]
*  to impose on somebody who doesn't believe in that same religion. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9010.72s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9012.72s)]
*  It's a unique tactic, I think, is his point. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9014.72s)]
*  Now, I understand how, to me, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9016.72s)]
*  it makes me trust him more. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9018.72s)]
*  You're being completely open and honest with me. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9020.72s)]
*  Every other politician lies. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9022.72s)]
*  And even if you don't seem as convicted as them, [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9024.72s)]
*  I trust you more for giving me that honesty. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9026.72s)]
*  And maybe that's why it wins. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9028.72s)]
*  But I think his point is just [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9030.72s)]
*  not good or bad, I've just never seen that done before. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9032.72s)]
*  And it works, and he didn't think it would work. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9034.72s)]
*  Because if I don't vote for him, it's a disaster. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9036.72s)]
*  And that might be to Trump's detriment. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9038.72s)]
*  It could be. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9040.72s)]
*  It is one of those very... [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9042.72s)]
*  It's a very unique thing. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9044.72s)]
*  If you look at border crossings, just by example, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9046.72s)]
*  whether you agree with it or not, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9048.72s)]
*  Biden, before the election, [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9050.72s)]
*  will come out and say, you've got to have a secure border, [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9052.72s)]
*  you've got to keep it tight, and I'm the one to do it. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9054.72s)]
*  And just deny this piece of reality. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9056.72s)]
*  It will happen. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9060.72s)]
*  He's already doing it with inflation. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9062.72s)]
*  Those are just some of the things Republicans aren't ready for. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9064.72s)]
*  The Republicans are going to have their jaw drop. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9066.72s)]
*  Make no mistake, the plan is already in place. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9068.72s)]
*  You're going to find a woman roughly 30 days before the election [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9070.72s)]
*  that Trump sexually abused [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9072.72s)]
*  outside of the China club in 1988. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9074.72s)]
*  And she didn't tell anybody, [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9076.72s)]
*  and there's no witnesses, but by God, you have to believe her. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9078.72s)]
*  And it's like, for sure, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9080.72s)]
*  for sure this will come out. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9082.72s)]
*  And it's one of those things, yeah. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9084.72s)]
*  And the Republicans won't do that. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9086.72s)]
*  Not only will the Republicans not do it, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9088.72s)]
*  they won't be ready for it when it happens. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9090.72s)]
*  They stand and go, I watched the debate [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9092.72s)]
*  between Ron DeSantis and Gavin Newsom. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9094.72s)]
*  And Ron DeSantis, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9096.72s)]
*  who was very ready for debates and a very educated man, [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9098.72s)]
*  was not ready for Gavin Newsom [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9100.72s)]
*  to flat out deny reality, [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9102.72s)]
*  to flat out say, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9104.72s)]
*  I've never done that. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9106.72s)]
*  Or to flat out take something that he did [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9108.72s)]
*  and then turn it on from the live TV and go, [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9110.72s)]
*  and I can't believe you. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9112.72s)]
*  And there's really not a way out of that if you're wrong. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9114.72s)]
*  To go, wait a minute, that's your record. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9116.72s)]
*  That's not mine. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9118.72s)]
*  It's like, no, that's not how it works. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9120.72s)]
*  Nobody's paying attention except you two. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9122.72s)]
*  There's just a crowd that is judging this moment. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9124.72s)]
*  And Gavin came out there and ran the stick. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9126.72s)]
*  Gavin will run them all out of town. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9128.72s)]
*  Nobody can touch Gavin. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9130.72s)]
*  No, there's nobody. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9132.72s)]
*  No current politician can touch him. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9134.72s)]
*  He is the best politician in the country. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9136.72s)]
*  Why? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9138.72s)]
*  Well, he was raised from day one. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9140.72s)]
*  They had him to be, at eight years old [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9142.72s)]
*  is when they started training him to be [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9144.72s)]
*  president. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9146.72s)]
*  And is he the nephew of Nancy Pelosi? [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9148.72s)]
*  He is the nephew of Nancy Pelosi. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9150.72s)]
*  I'll just share with you, [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9152.72s)]
*  there's a very likely scenario down the road [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9154.72s)]
*  where it's Gavin Newsom versus [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9156.72s)]
*  Don Jr. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9158.72s)]
*  in the finals in general. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9160.72s)]
*  And I don't think Don Jr. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9162.72s)]
*  got it like his dad. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9164.72s)]
*  And maybe not. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9166.72s)]
*  I think he does. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9168.72s)]
*  I think that he's really good. I think he was the breakthrough [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9170.72s)]
*  star, in fact, of 16. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9172.72s)]
*  Do you remember in 2004, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9174.72s)]
*  Barack Obama was the breakthrough star. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9176.72s)]
*  Nobody even heard of him. He was a first term senator and he was the one [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9178.72s)]
*  that was really running and lit it up. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9180.72s)]
*  I'm not sure enough to get Hillary in and got elected [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9182.72s)]
*  the next two terms, but I'm just sharing [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9184.72s)]
*  that I could see [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9186.72s)]
*  Junior and Newsom in the [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9188.72s)]
*  finals and Junior's [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9190.72s)]
*  current wife used to be married to Newsom. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9192.72s)]
*  It would be an interesting [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9194.72s)]
*  piece of the story. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9196.72s)]
*  For drama. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9198.72s)]
*  It would be fun. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9200.72s)]
*  It would be fun. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9202.72s)]
*  Junior's a shark though. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9204.72s)]
*  I think he surprised everybody. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9206.72s)]
*  I think that the old man wanted Ivanka. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9208.72s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9210.72s)]
*  Is it polite? This is Junior's wife [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9212.72s)]
*  we're talking about here. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9214.72s)]
*  This is very polite. This is self-admitted from her. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9216.72s)]
*  I had a bit back in the day [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9218.72s)]
*  about [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9220.72s)]
*  Trump grabbing [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9222.72s)]
*  the girl by the pussy. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9224.72s)]
*  And [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9226.72s)]
*  it's a funny bit. You can go look it up on [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9228.72s)]
*  my mouth and redo the bit here. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9230.72s)]
*  But it was in his defense, obviously. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9232.72s)]
*  And [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9234.72s)]
*  I noticed once, this is a bit I did [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9236.72s)]
*  a long time ago. And I'm on Instagram, [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9238.72s)]
*  I noticed Kimberly [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9240.72s)]
*  Guilfoyle likes the bit. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9242.72s)]
*  I get notified, right? And I'm like, oh [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9244.72s)]
*  shit, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Oh my god, that's Trump [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9246.72s)]
*  Jr.'s son. That's funny. And then [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9248.72s)]
*  it said Kimberly Guilfoyle followed [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9250.72s)]
*  you from that joke. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9252.72s)]
*  And I was like, wow. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9254.72s)]
*  What a woman. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9256.72s)]
*  To see the joke [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9258.72s)]
*  defending Trump grabbing [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9260.72s)]
*  women by the pussy and be like, [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9262.72s)]
*  I need to follow this guy. I can see [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9264.72s)]
*  what else this guy's got. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9266.72s)]
*  She's locked it. She's 100 percent [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9268.72s)]
*  committed to the Trump family. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9270.72s)]
*  I like that story. I'm glad that you told that story. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9272.72s)]
*  That had me a little nervous at first. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9274.72s)]
*  I get it. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9276.72s)]
*  I mean, doesn't she have the dirt on [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9278.72s)]
*  Newsom though? Yeah, you would sure think. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9280.72s)]
*  I can't imagine that she would [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9282.72s)]
*  bring that out. And I wouldn't respect [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9284.72s)]
*  it if they did. Like, have you ever been around the guys [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9286.72s)]
*  and then the guys start showing you like a text message [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9288.72s)]
*  of some girl and she like [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9290.72s)]
*  sent them a dirty text and then he's shown it to you. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9292.72s)]
*  I don't like that guy. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9294.72s)]
*  That was a private thing [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9296.72s)]
*  that she sent. I don't know. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9298.72s)]
*  It's just one of those things. And if she did bring up the dirt on [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9300.72s)]
*  Newsom, I actually, I wouldn't want [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9302.72s)]
*  to hear it. Really? I mean, I would think that [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9304.72s)]
*  that's unsportsmanlike. Yeah. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9306.72s)]
*  That is private. That was in the compor- [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9308.72s)]
*  sportsmanlike. That would be a [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9310.72s)]
*  dirty thing to do and [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9312.72s)]
*  I would be disappointed. I realize that was funny. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9314.72s)]
*  I mean, it feels like out of bounds. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9316.72s)]
*  So you're suggesting honey pots. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9318.72s)]
*  Like, if a hot girl tries to seduce a guy to get secrets. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9320.72s)]
*  Yes. Oh, yeah. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9322.72s)]
*  Yes, I would think that that would be [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9324.72s)]
*  Unless it's an intentional [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9326.72s)]
*  ruse. If it's intentional, is it gamesmanship or is it still- [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9328.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9330.72s)]
*  Guess I'll need some time to think about that. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9332.72s)]
*  They don't do that back in Westland. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9334.72s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9336.72s)]
*  The prettiest girls in the world are in Westland. I don't know [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9338.72s)]
*  about the girls out here, the desperate girls in New York. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9340.72s)]
*  New blue secrets [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9342.72s)]
*  got taken by honey. Sure. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9344.72s)]
*  It's an Israeli woman, actually. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9346.72s)]
*  I'm sorry for the insensitivity we might have [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9348.72s)]
*  said with the word gay earlier. I didn't see the fingernails [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9350.72s)]
*  coming. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9352.72s)]
*  That didn't- [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9354.72s)]
*  Yeah, now I gotta [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9356.72s)]
*  get the best roast of my fingernails. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9358.72s)]
*  I respect that. I respect that one. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9360.72s)]
*  You guys have been trying to get rid of me for 20 minutes. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9362.72s)]
*  Can you say, yeah, yeah, wrap it or what do we do? [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9364.72s)]
*  How do we- [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9366.72s)]
*  Jail Sondad, everybody! [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrLQCvbyxA&t=9368.72s)]
