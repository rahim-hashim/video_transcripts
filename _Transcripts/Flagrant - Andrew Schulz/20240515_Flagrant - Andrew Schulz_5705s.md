# Shannon Sharpe vs Shaq Heated Beef, Vitaly Pedo Hunting, & Seinfeld Commencement Walk Out
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M)
*  John, this move that Drake did in this entire beef is going up against the greatest musical producer of our generation, which is Metro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=0.0s)]
*  Excuse me, I was not familiar with your game. Metro, I was not familiar with your game. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=9.0s)]
*  And then when someone put me on and tell me that he's basically Dr. Dre now, his solo album went number one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=13.0s)]
*  Hitmaker, you don't go up against the hitmaker in a fucking music beat. He put together BBL John. I can't stop singing it. I'm imagining Drake's ass. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=20.0s)]
*  Hey, yo, BBL Drezy. Oh my God. Metro has completely transformed this beat for me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=29.0s)]
*  The best bar before Kendrick Drop was Metro Shut Your Ho Ass Up and Make Some Drums. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=36.0s)]
*  What a fucking idiot. Shut the fuck up and make some drums with the greatest musician in history. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=40.0s)]
*  You literally are beefing with Beethoven. You're done. There's no reason to beef against Metro Bovine and Beethoven. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=44.0s)]
*  The Beethoven. We're calling Metro Beethoven. Isn't there a... Zaytoven. Fuck him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=51.0s)]
*  With all due respect, you're great. But I needed to say that in that moment. You understand the flow. That was music right there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=58.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, this Metro guy, I'm more terrified of that guy than him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=67.0s)]
*  Dude, because when he's getting made fun of, you are like, yeah, how does a producer, how do you win as a producer? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=72.0s)]
*  Here's a fantastic free beat. So there's an Indian girl doing a dance over it. It's insane. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=78.0s)]
*  She needs a BBL most likely. I saw Brazilians with BBLs doing merengue. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=86.0s)]
*  Damn, I just got to say that shit before fucking Vitaly comes on here and starts catching pedophiles. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=92.0s)]
*  Speaking of, that would be the greatest prank of all time. Have you seen these guys live streaming the pedophile catching? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=99.0s)]
*  I want to have a whole other discussion about this on the pod because Mark and I have been going, how easy is it to just find pedophiles? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=107.0s)]
*  It's scary. They probably banked a few. But the ultimate troll would be showing up to the embassy in Toronto. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=113.0s)]
*  That would be the ultimate troll. There have been like four people arrested so far. Have you seen this? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=122.0s)]
*  If they want to get shot, they can show up to the embassy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=127.0s)]
*  Okay, hold on. So let's just go back to this. Okay, Metro Boomin, now that we know who's the greatest musician alive right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=130.0s)]
*  Now that we know that. Okay, listen, why didn't y'all tell me? It's crazy that y'all didn't tell me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=135.0s)]
*  I mean, he didn't really make the song. I'm sorry. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=141.0s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=145.0s)]
*  It was somebody with AI made it. He just added drums on top of it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=146.0s)]
*  No, he pulled the sample. He pulled the sample. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=151.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=153.0s)]
*  That was like somebody you remember. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=154.0s)]
*  You make me hate you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=156.0s)]
*  I know. I was like, I really want to just pop this balloon. Yes, I did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=157.0s)]
*  Metro, Metro. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=170.0s)]
*  You're only Metro, man. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=171.0s)]
*  Metro, Metro. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=172.0s)]
*  I don't believe that, Metro. At Metro, I don't believe that. I'm 4chan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=174.0s)]
*  Whatever 4chan is for Metro, I'm that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=179.0s)]
*  Q and O. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=181.0s)]
*  Q and O. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=182.0s)]
*  Q and O. Yeah, I'm Q and O for Metro. I believe that you can't make a good song without him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=183.0s)]
*  I think Metro is Mustard. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=187.0s)]
*  I don't know the original. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=189.0s)]
*  You think he's also DJing Mustard? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=190.0s)]
*  Mustard on the beat. If you put that reverse. Metro, that's what it says. Metro Boomin on the beat. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=191.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Is y'all flipping nippers, Metro? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=199.0s)]
*  Everything comes back to Metro if you really just reversed it. Throw some AC on here, Metro, please. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=204.0s)]
*  Metro controls all things. I'm telling you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=209.0s)]
*  Wait, what is the original BBL Drizzy? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=212.0s)]
*  Stop hating, bro. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=214.0s)]
*  It just came out online. There was a bunch of people making a bunch of A.I. songs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=215.0s)]
*  He leaked it. He leaked it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=218.0s)]
*  And that was a really funny one. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=219.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=221.0s)]
*  I heard the guy, the comedian that did the BBL Drizzy song. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then he just added some drums to it. So it's like he plays the original version. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=225.0s)]
*  And then there's a flip and then the beat comes in. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=229.0s)]
*  But was the instrumental samples already on the original? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=236.0s)]
*  No, no, no. But the track behind it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=238.0s)]
*  Exactly. Now, now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=240.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm not sure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=241.0s)]
*  I know he added beats. But the song, it sounded exactly the same. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=242.0s)]
*  Yo, yo, yo. Now you're feeling the fire. Now you're feeling the fire. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=246.0s)]
*  Mark got you in the corner right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=249.0s)]
*  Put the baby reindeer in the corner. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=251.0s)]
*  Put the baby reindeer in the corner. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=253.0s)]
*  Give you a Metro, don't trust you, I'ma shoot you. I'ma. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=255.0s)]
*  Alright. Alright. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=258.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=261.0s)]
*  I understand now why they say that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=263.0s)]
*  Some more people call him Metro Grooming. Have you heard about this? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of tweets. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=268.0s)]
*  Don't break my fucking heart. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=269.0s)]
*  You gotta defend him, bro. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=270.0s)]
*  Don't break my fucking heart. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=272.0s)]
*  Some people brought this up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah, you wanna talk about things you should have been told about. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=274.0s)]
*  This should have been said at the top of the podcast. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=276.0s)]
*  This guy, this guy don't trust you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=281.0s)]

*  Because the songs good. The songs are good. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=306.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, hold on. Are you telling me Metro got grooming allegations? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=308.0s)]
*  Nah, he's got some tweets that are wild. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=311.0s)]
*  About what? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=313.0s)]
*  I think he's trying to be funny. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=314.0s)]
*  Oh, if he's trying to be funny, let it rip. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=315.0s)]
*  But it's some wild tweets. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=316.0s)]
*  Can I see it first before I say things? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=318.0s)]
*  Why do I keep saying things? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=320.0s)]
*  Can you stop me from saying things that are going to be incriminating? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=322.0s)]
*  Vitaly is going to walk in the fucking door at any moment right now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=325.0s)]
*  Alright, so I don't know if these are true. This has just been circulated online. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=329.0s)]
*  People are pointing these out. So let's just read a couple, shall we? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=332.0s)]
*  She might be young, but she ready. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=334.0s)]
*  I mean, hold on. It gets more damning. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=338.0s)]
*  This is not good. This is not good. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=341.0s)]
*  When you collect all the things that people have ever said on one topic, this is what happened to the white guy, James Gunn. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=344.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=350.0s)]
*  The things I would do to Sierra are probably illegal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=351.0s)]
*  That's fine. She's of age. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=354.0s)]
*  I've got to never be more Indian than this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=361.0s)]
*  I know, but sorry. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=363.0s)]
*  I've got to never be more Indian than this. That shit just jumped out of him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=365.0s)]
*  He just started like, whoop, whoop, whoop. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=368.0s)]
*  He just started grinning. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=370.0s)]
*  I had my pedophilia radars up. I was thinking about other things. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=372.0s)]
*  You can only defend one thing at a time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=375.0s)]
*  The post of the three. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=378.0s)]
*  Walking through the grocery store with both hands in my cackie is like a true pedophile though. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=382.0s)]
*  Hashtag no pedo. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=386.0s)]
*  Hashtag no pedo. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=388.0s)]
*  Hashtag no pedo. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=390.0s)]
*  Hashtag no pedo. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=392.0s)]
*  What? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=393.0s)]
*  Apparently he was like 15 or 14 or 15 when he tweeted these. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=394.0s)]
*  Why don't you say that first when you put allegations on the man? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=397.0s)]
*  This is a story, I'm building art. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=401.0s)]
*  This is the greatest musician in the history of the world. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=403.0s)]
*  He says I can't be a pedophile at 15. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=406.0s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. This is the one I think. There's another one that's... [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=408.0s)]
*  Oh no, no. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=410.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=411.0s)]
*  How do you know all this? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=412.0s)]
*  Who's feeding you this information? Y'all part of Drake's camp, aren't you? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=413.0s)]
*  Follow more black people on Twitter. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=416.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something. It's very fun to just flip sides every week on this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=418.0s)]
*  And y'all don't even know that there was another side and it's called Metro. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=423.0s)]
*  You thought it was about Kendrick and Drake. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=426.0s)]
*  It's a hip hop commentator and all of entertainment, dude. Let's go. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=428.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the reality of the matter. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=431.0s)]
*  You're talking about right now, the Elon Musk of Beats. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, read that one. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=436.0s)]
*  If I get a chick that wants me to get her some mollies, is that guaranteed pussy LOL? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=437.0s)]
*  Then what's Metro's response? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=442.0s)]
*  Yes, maybe even for the crew too. LOL, retweet. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=444.0s)]
*  So we gotta look into that, is it? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=449.0s)]
*  Got your little sister on the mollies, she done ran through the whole squad. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=451.0s)]
*  So... [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=455.0s)]
*  Metro, that's your king, bro. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=456.0s)]
*  That's your king. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=458.0s)]
*  But if he put that on a beat, how fire, bro. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=460.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=462.0s)]
*  You're gonna want some mollies. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=463.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm distraught. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=465.0s)]
*  I'm for Molly and Drake shit. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=467.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. Now it's fire. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=469.0s)]
*  How old is Metro? Cause we gotta see the dates on some of these. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=471.0s)]
*  These are 2012 though. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=474.0s)]
*  All these tweets are 10 years ago. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=476.0s)]
*  This is 12 years ago. So how old is he? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=477.0s)]
*  Oh, so he aged out of rate. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=480.0s)]
*  Can I tell y'all something? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=482.0s)]
*  He was only a 20 year old when he tweeted. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=484.0s)]
*  Can I tell y'all something? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=487.0s)]
*  Can I just say, yo, I'm so racy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=489.0s)]
*  He was 18. He was 18. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=492.0s)]
*  He was 18. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=494.0s)]
*  I was gonna say, if you're 16 and you're trying to be funny, you don't know the consequences of trying to be funny. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=495.0s)]
*  You're just a kid tweeting. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=501.0s)]
*  But he's 18 at that point, so that's a little worse. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=503.0s)]
*  19 maybe, to be honest with you. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=505.0s)]
*  Now your math is working. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=507.0s)]
*  Now with the kids. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=509.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=511.0s)]
*  Doing his podcast is like skydiving. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=513.0s)]
*  And you just hope that you have a parachute. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=515.0s)]
*  I'm trying to help you out, bro. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=519.0s)]
*  I'm talking about me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=521.0s)]
*  Oh, do you also feel like you're skydiving without a parachute? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=523.0s)]
*  Cause that's what I do. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=526.0s)]
*  I started with the podcast with, Metro is the greatest guy in history. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=531.0s)]
*  He didn't say guy. He said producer, to be fair. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=532.0s)]
*  Music, musician. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=534.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=535.0s)]
*  Producer of tweets. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=536.0s)]
*  The greatest producer of tweets. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=537.0s)]
*  Drake was comparing himself to Michael Jackson post allegations. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=539.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=542.0s)]
*  I'm like he was saying. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=543.0s)]
*  That's facts. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=545.0s)]
*  That being said, oh my goodness, guys. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=546.0s)]
*  We have a whole kerfuffle we have to assess. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=550.0s)]
*  What a day for you, dude. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=552.0s)]
*  This has been a fucking... [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=553.0s)]
*  I mean, so many things are going on. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=554.0s)]
*  A lot of people getting exposed the first hour of this podcast. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=556.0s)]
*  What the fuck is happening in this world? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=559.0s)]
*  We need Vitaly, dude. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=561.0s)]
*  Should we talk about Vitaly and how he knows where every pedophile is on the planet? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=562.0s)]
*  Yeah, we could. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=566.0s)]
*  I think we need to have that discussion. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=567.0s)]
*  Have you seen what's happening? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=569.0s)]
*  I've seen a couple of videos. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=570.0s)]
*  Okay, so there's all these guys that are streaming. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=571.0s)]
*  It's not just one channel. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=573.0s)]
*  There are all these guys streaming. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=574.0s)]
*  And they all catch pedophiles. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=575.0s)]
*  And then they all humiliate them. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=577.0s)]
*  And I think they just let them go back out there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=579.0s)]
*  It's like catch and release. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=581.0s)]
*  So what I'm curious about is why, one, are they not getting arrested? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=583.0s)]
*  And then two, how do they find them? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=588.0s)]
*  Are they baiting them online? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=591.0s)]
*  I think they're baiting them online. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=593.0s)]
*  So the way... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=594.0s)]
*  Catching credit protection. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=595.0s)]
*  He's kind of cryptic with it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=596.0s)]
*  It seems... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=597.0s)]
*  I've watched a couple of the streams. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=598.0s)]
*  And he doesn't exactly say. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=599.0s)]
*  I'm assuming because he doesn't want to tip off how he's getting them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=600.0s)]
*  Because then if people know, then there'll be less people to get, I guess. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=603.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=606.0s)]
*  But it seems like what he's doing is he's going on dating apps as a girl. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=607.0s)]
*  And using girls' photos on dating apps. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=611.0s)]
*  And then they go on texting. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=613.0s)]
*  And then they disclose that they're underage. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=614.0s)]
*  And then they text with the people. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=616.0s)]
*  And if they're still down to meet up, that's when they meet up. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=618.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=620.0s)]
*  So they start out as above age. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=621.0s)]
*  No, I think they start out and say, like, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=623.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm 18 on the dating app because you have to be above 18. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=625.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=627.0s)]
*  You start out legit on the dating app. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=628.0s)]
*  And then you later say that you're actually... [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=631.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm actually 15. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=634.0s)]
*  But I want to be 18 on the dating app. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=635.0s)]
*  But I still want to meet people. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=636.0s)]
*  Do you want to meet up? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=638.0s)]
*  And then that's when you guys... [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=639.0s)]
*  Is what I think. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=641.0s)]
*  This is just based off what I'm putting together through watch. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=642.0s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=644.0s)]
*  Now, if you are a normal, sane human being, the second a girl says, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=646.0s)]
*  Hey, I lied about my age on the dating app. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=651.0s)]
*  I'm underage. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=653.0s)]
*  You immediately cut off the application. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=654.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=656.0s)]
*  You should even light up the account. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=657.0s)]
*  You should even call the dating app and be like, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=659.0s)]
*  Yo, there's this girl. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=661.0s)]
*  She's masquerading as an 18-year-old. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=662.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on here? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=663.0s)]
*  But these guys are pedophiles. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=665.0s)]
*  So that's how you find the pedos. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=666.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=668.0s)]
*  So the person who has to have those convos, though, that's a sicko mode. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=669.0s)]
*  Like, you've got to pretend to be a young girl. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=673.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the whole Chris Hansen shit. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=677.0s)]
*  Talk to the fucking weirdos and shit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=678.0s)]
*  That's the whole Chris Hansen shit. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=679.0s)]
*  He's a little... [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=680.0s)]
*  Well, he's not actually doing it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=681.0s)]
*  But it's like his little people. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=682.0s)]
*  He's a little pedo, so. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=683.0s)]
*  So interesting. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=684.0s)]
*  I love that guy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=685.0s)]
*  Maybe you can't arrest them because you were never underage. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=686.0s)]
*  There wasn't an underage person. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=692.0s)]
*  They thought they were going to meet up with an underage person. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=695.0s)]
*  It depends. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=697.0s)]
*  I looked into it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=698.0s)]
*  So like basically... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=699.0s)]
*  Yeah, years ago. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=700.0s)]
*  2020, Mark, I'm looking into it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=701.0s)]
*  You know what's great? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=705.0s)]
*  I was like, Mark is going to have to describe this. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=706.0s)]
*  It is impossible for him to not look like one. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=711.0s)]
*  So yeah, all right, go. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=714.0s)]
*  I mean, y'all can describe it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=716.0s)]
*  No pedos. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=717.0s)]
*  There's no pedos. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=718.0s)]
*  No pedos. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=719.0s)]
*  And then explain all this. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=720.0s)]
*  How does this go? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=721.0s)]
*  He's sitting on that for so long. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=722.0s)]
*  No, because I asked him, I was like, son, in order for us to talk about this, we need [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=723.0s)]
*  to know what's going on. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=727.0s)]
*  So now Mark is forced to figure out the whole fucking scam. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=728.0s)]
*  I don't want to be this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=731.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=732.0s)]
*  But you forced me to be this. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=733.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=734.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=735.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=736.0s)]
*  I mean, y'all can explain it if someone else wants to take it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=737.0s)]
*  Nah, you got it, my friend. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=738.0s)]
*  You got it? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=739.0s)]
*  I got it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=740.0s)]
*  So to get them arrested, they have to express sexual intent. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=741.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=744.0s)]
*  So if they just say, hey, you're 15, let's go get pizza. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=745.0s)]
*  Not illegal. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=748.0s)]
*  You have to get them to say, you have to get them to like send nudes or have sexual intent. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=749.0s)]
*  You can go through their bag and see if they have like sexual items on them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=753.44s)]
*  But then even that might not be enough to actually prove it in court. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=756.32s)]
*  So you need them to do some sexual shit on the chat. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=759.0s)]
*  So none of them and, but okay, so they don't. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=761.54s)]
*  Some of them do. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=763.96s)]
*  But then they have to prove it to the cops and then go through the court of law. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=765.82s)]
*  This is why in To Catch a Predator, they make them bring certain items. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=769.28s)]
*  Bring alcohol. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=774.0s)]
*  Bring condoms. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=775.0s)]
*  Bring alcohol. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=776.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=777.0s)]
*  And they also do it with the police a lot more, the To Catch a Predator back in the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=778.0s)]
*  day. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=781.92s)]
*  And a lot of these YouTubers don't. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=782.92s)]
*  So there's also the problem where they run into where they'll be like, arrest this guy [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=783.92s)]
*  and the cops are like, we don't know what the fuck is going on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=786.28s)]
*  Which maybe it should be illegal though if you're just trying to meet up with a kid. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=787.92s)]
*  Always. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=790.76s)]
*  Like it's not illegal and it probably should be. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=791.76s)]
*  It should be illegal. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=793.12s)]
*  Like these guys, like if you're 40 trying to meet up with a 15 year old for whatever [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=794.12s)]
*  reason. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  Go to jail immediately. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=799.88s)]
*  Unless, I was about to say, unless you're like a religious figure and then it's like, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=800.88s)]
*  actually. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=803.84s)]
*  Straight to heaven. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=804.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=805.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=806.84s)]
*  I think that is their heaven. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=807.84s)]
*  It is crazy though that there are, people are going on these streams. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=809.84s)]
*  So like celebrities that have like an album coming out or something they're promoting [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=815.12s)]
*  are going on the live stream to catch the pedophile. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=819.08s)]
*  Ryan Garcia was on it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  Lil Pump did one. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=823.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think Bobby Schmurda went on. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=826.2s)]
*  Martin did one. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=827.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=828.32s)]
*  Like what is, what is happening in content? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=829.32s)]
*  I can't decide if this is great or bad. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=832.76s)]
*  Yeah I know. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=834.6400000000001s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  It is tricky right? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=836.6400000000001s)]
*  Cause you're like, okay, they are exposing these people that are pedophiles. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=837.6400000000001s)]
*  Which we want as many of those castrated done. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=841.1600000000001s)]
*  But if they're not getting arrested, then is it something that's just being done so [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=845.6s)]
*  that you can make money? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=852.12s)]
*  So now you're using the worst possible thing in the world, which is the molestation of [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=854.84s)]
*  children as content and views for your own monetization strategies. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=858.76s)]
*  And not necessarily even getting these guys thrown in prison. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=865.12s)]
*  If they all went to prison or even like a good amount of them, I'd be like, hey, this [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=867.6s)]
*  is fucking awesome. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=870.6s)]
*  But if none of them go to prison, you just make money. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=871.64s)]
*  Some of them got arrested. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=874.0s)]
*  Some of them do get arrested. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=875.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=876.0s)]
*  But some are getting away with it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=877.0s)]
*  This is actually, there's a guy, I looked into this last night. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=878.0s)]
*  There's a guy named Kyle Swanson who's being, he did this. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=880.2800000000001s)]
*  He used to catch these. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=883.44s)]
*  There's a bunch of them. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=884.72s)]
*  He looked into it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=885.72s)]
*  He couldn't bail you out. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=886.72s)]
*  He put last night on him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=887.72s)]
*  Very important. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=888.72s)]
*  Mark told me. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=889.72s)]
*  There's this guy that he would catch these people and then what was happening is they [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=890.72s)]
*  weren't getting arrested. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  They go home and delete all of their backlogs and everything, which makes it harder for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=898.96s)]
*  the police. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=903.12s)]
*  So the police actually told him to stop doing it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=904.12s)]
*  He didn't stop doing it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=906.7600000000001s)]
*  And the police had to get him for obstruction of justice because they were on a case of [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=907.7600000000001s)]
*  a guy that he also was on the case of. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=911.52s)]
*  That guy deleted everything he had and now there's less evidence. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=914.04s)]
*  So the argument that I would make if I'm defending the streamers is even if they don't get arrested, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=918.6s)]
*  we're putting them out here. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=923.56s)]
*  Their pictures are out there. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=924.72s)]
*  Everybody knows who they are now. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=925.98s)]
*  You can put them on like chat rooms and Facebook groups, et cetera. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=927.52s)]
*  So everybody in these cities can be like, oh my God, that was my neighbor. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=930.8s)]
*  This motherfucker likes kids. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=934.54s)]
*  I'm, I got to keep them away from my children. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=935.54s)]
*  They'll get fired from their jobs. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=938.04s)]
*  So that's me if I'm defending the streamers. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=939.32s)]
*  So even though they don't get arrested, they get humiliated. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=942.0200000000001s)]
*  And some do get arrested. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=945.12s)]
*  I watched some of the streams where some of them got arrested. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=946.12s)]
*  Whether or not they get charged, I don't know. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=948.2800000000001s)]
*  They're least arrested, but they might not even end up going to jail. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=950.6s)]
*  Life tour announcement. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=953.84s)]
*  Next week, we're back in Abu Dhabi. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=955.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  The Etihad Arena. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=958.0400000000001s)]
*  Once again, we're rocking it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=959.24s)]
*  I will see you all there. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=960.6400000000001s)]
*  Not only am I looking forward to Etihad, the Etihad Arena show being back in Abu Dhabi, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=962.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm looking forward to that flight. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=968.4399999999999s)]
*  At 8380, the Airbus, they got like a little bar area in the back. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=969.9599999999999s)]
*  It is kind of wild. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=973.36s)]
*  It is kind of wild. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=974.54s)]
*  I think I'm going to need a Force Dove to get an upgrade that he pays for himself. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=975.54s)]
*  So I have someone to hang out in the back of the bar. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=979.22s)]
*  I had nobody to talk to back there, so I went back quickly. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=980.88s)]
*  But it is a sick, yeah, it is a sick, it is a sick plane. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  So shout out to Etihad Airlines. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=988.52s)]
*  We need a Jacuzzi next, Etihad. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=990.8399999999999s)]
*  What else can we put in there? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=993.12s)]
*  Can we have the hookah lounge? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=994.12s)]
*  What else? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=996.12s)]
*  I don't know if we want smoking on a plane. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=997.12s)]
*  That might be terrifying. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=998.96s)]
*  But I think we need to figure out what else we can put into Etihad. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=999.96s)]
*  How do you take it to the next level? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1002.44s)]
*  What else do you have in the plane? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1004.28s)]

*  And I saw a clip from one where they caught the same guy. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1093.04s)]
*  One streamer was like, oh, yeah, I caught that guy last week. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1098.1200000000001s)]
*  And then Vitaly was on the stream and got the same guy. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1100.64s)]
*  So they're not doing that good of a job keeping him off the streets. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1103.8s)]
*  So then and then then we have to have that conversation, which is where it's like you're [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1106.96s)]
*  not keeping them off the streets and you're just making money off it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1110.26s)]
*  Are you making money off of child porn? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1112.76s)]
*  It's kind of what it is, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1117.56s)]
*  I mean, it's not actually the sex of children, but it is the idea of it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1119.0s)]
*  It's a little licky. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1123.48s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1125.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1125.76s)]
*  Every guy's get arrested. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  Are they donating? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1127.48s)]
*  Are they donating the proceeds in any way to stop this? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1128.4s)]
*  Like, is there some sort of contribution to fight your child's sex trafficking? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  Human trafficking. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1135.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1136.52s)]
*  And then some of them even have a case against them. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1136.92s)]
*  So like if they're like they're like shaving their eyebrows and like shaving [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1138.72s)]
*  their heads, punching them in the face. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1142.28s)]
*  Love this. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1143.28s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1144.08s)]
*  And then that's battery. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1144.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1146.16s)]
*  And false imprisonment getting in trouble. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1146.3999999999999s)]
*  Or like they're keeping them in a place and they're not letting them leave. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1148.08s)]
*  False imprisonment. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1150.92s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1151.76s)]
*  So it's like, that's why Chris Hansen's whole thing was like, you're allowed to go [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1152.76s)]
*  anytime you want. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1155.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1156.28s)]
*  Because he can't be liable. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1156.56s)]
*  You know what he got off the air? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1159.2s)]
*  Chris Hansen? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1161.72s)]
*  This guy killed himself in 2007 after being on the show. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1162.12s)]
*  And it went back that it was the show set him up to kill himself. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1166.44s)]
*  He wasn't actually a pedophile. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1171.08s)]
*  He possibly was. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1172.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1174.12s)]
*  It never went to court. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1174.32s)]
*  I'm fine with that, bro. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1175.32s)]
*  Like I ain't feeling bad about some. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  But it was a hundred million dollar suit. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1179.12s)]
*  And that's what some people are saying. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1181.0s)]
*  Like judges and cops are saying. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1182.52s)]
*  Who sued? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1183.9599999999998s)]
*  The estate, I imagine. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1185.32s)]
*  His family? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1186.9199999999998s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1187.6799999999998s)]
*  His pedophile protecting family? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1188.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1190.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1191.32s)]
*  But they're saying, but they're saying these YouTubers could be held liable. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1191.8s)]
*  They just want to. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1195.04s)]
*  They just want to. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1195.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucking crazy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1196.2399999999998s)]
*  These YouTubers could be held liable if something were bad to happen to the person after. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1198.12s)]
*  Yo, this. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1202.08s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1202.6399999999999s)]
*  This one is crazy. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1203.08s)]
*  This is one of the things that happened. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1203.76s)]
*  So they catch this guy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't exactly remember what they wanted him to do or like what exactly his charge was necessarily. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1207.08s)]
*  But this guy was supposed to meet up with a kid and. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1213.3999999999999s)]
*  This is a random passerby that pulls up and he's like, yo, this is a pedophile of Italian. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1218.24s)]
*  He's like, yeah, there's a pedophile. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1221.6s)]
*  And then the dude just does this. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1222.84s)]
*  Oh, he's dead. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1225.76s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1228.08s)]
*  You guys just fucking did that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1229.0s)]
*  Why is it no fucking way? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1230.68s)]
*  Do y'all not want to do that? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1233.36s)]
*  You see someone trying to meet up with a child and you don't feel inclined to punch them? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1235.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1239.3999999999999s)]
*  Why is that guy surprised? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1239.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1242.24s)]
*  So that's the right reaction. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  Like what world are we living on? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1245.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1246.2s)]
*  They're all like, hey, we got to keep running the numbers up. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1247.08s)]
*  So they don't touch the guys at all. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1249.96s)]
*  Like what I see a lot of them do, they're like spray confetti on them and that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, right. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1257.56s)]
*  This is just silly. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1259.3999999999999s)]
*  Like it is. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1261.0s)]
*  Apparently that guy, there were claims that he died on the way to the hospital. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1262.2s)]
*  Oh, and then Vitaly went on Twitter and was like, no, he didn't die. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1266.76s)]
*  But I haven't been able to find legit confirmation either way. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1270.9199999999998s)]
*  So Vitaly's claiming that he didn't die, but he did get arrested. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1273.8s)]
*  You know, if I'm, if I'm the streaming company, whatever they are, a kick, I'm like, yo, we [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1277.1599999999999s)]
*  got to make, if we got to make a real contribution to stop sex trafficking. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1282.2s)]
*  Like on behalf of the streamer, if a lot of our streamers are going to do this type of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1286.68s)]
*  content, they need to make sure that they're being 60% at least got to go to something [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1292.44s)]
*  benevolent. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1299.4s)]
*  There has to be benevolence and care. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1299.96s)]
*  Do it legit. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1301.4s)]
*  Just link up with the police. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1302.04s)]
*  So apparently police departments in specific cities are asking them not to do this because [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1303.4s)]
*  a lot of these people will get caught and then they just get released. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1306.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1310.28s)]
*  And then like Miles was saying, they go home, delete all their stuff. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1310.52s)]
*  And then they're, then they're more slick with it and they're able to abuse more people. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1312.8400000000001s)]
*  So I just work with the actual police. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1316.2s)]
*  But low key it makes me think like the fuck the police doing? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1318.4399999999998s)]
*  If it's that easy, if it's that easy and you can't get these guys, they're not doing shit. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1321.56s)]
*  But they also can't build cases. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1325.8s)]
*  The police basically are like, yeah, these people can catch them, but they're not building [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  like actual evidence and cases against them. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1331.0s)]
*  They can't like, they have to go subpoena all their stuff. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1333.24s)]
*  Proving guilty. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1336.28s)]
*  So you got to have enough to prove. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1336.9199999999998s)]
*  Because you can get a guy to show up, but you then have to go into the courtroom, say, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1338.52s)]
*  look, he did this. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1342.2s)]
*  We have the X amount of terabytes of X and whatever it might be. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1343.32s)]
*  Nobody tried putting it over a mustard beat. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1347.8799999999999s)]
*  Cause that shit works. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1351.3999999999999s)]
*  That shit convinced me of anything. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1352.6799999999998s)]
*  Damn near. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1355.32s)]
*  Metro. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1355.96s)]
*  No, mustard. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1357.08s)]
*  Well, you're giving credit. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1357.96s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1358.76s)]
*  Mustard is the guy. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1359.56s)]
*  I know, but he was saying you were giving Metro all the credit. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1360.84s)]
*  No, but I've switched already. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1362.84s)]
*  I'm talking about Not Like Us. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1365.72s)]
*  Metro's on a Vitaly video. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1367.0s)]
*  Not Like Us. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1369.48s)]
*  Not Like Us is the pedophile song, right? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1370.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1373.8s)]
*  They not like us. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1375.24s)]
*  They not like us. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1376.36s)]
*  LA is fire, dog. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1378.04s)]
*  I was, Kendrick changed my whole perception of LA. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1379.16s)]
*  I went there this weekend. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah, this place is great. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1382.44s)]
*  I never thought that the whole time. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1384.28s)]
*  I lived there for two years. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1385.48s)]
*  This time I went, I was like, man, this is a great city, dude. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1386.76s)]
*  Pedophiles are in Toronto now. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1391.3999999999999s)]
*  We're good here. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1392.76s)]
*  God damn, bro. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1394.2s)]
*  We're good. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1395.48s)]
*  Who's a pedophile? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1396.12s)]
*  Allegedly people in Toronto. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1397.56s)]
*  People? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1399.88s)]
*  People. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1401.08s)]
*  There's a whole embassy. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1401.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1408.76s)]
*  So what does Drake do right now? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1409.24s)]
*  One idea was Drake should drop a song on BBL Drizzy. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1411.16s)]
*  Yeah, he just needs a hit. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1417.72s)]
*  And BBL Drizzy is a hit. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1419.0s)]
*  And then I saw F.A. post this and F.A. was like, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1420.84s)]
*  he should just flip BBL to Bad Bitches Love Drake. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1423.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1427.32s)]
*  BBL Bad Bitches Love Drizzy. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1427.8s)]
*  And use the beat. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1430.12s)]
*  So you're leaning into the jokes that people are making. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1431.6399999999999s)]
*  And then unfortunately, he might just have to say, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1433.8s)]
*  I fucked all these guys' girls and that's why they upset. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1436.36s)]
*  Because I think at this point, it seems to me at this point, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1440.12s)]
*  maybe like, it seems like he's just trying to fuck everybody's girl. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1443.72s)]
*  Put it that way. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1448.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I've heard. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1449.3999999999999s)]
*  And if you are that type of dude, like, and you're doing it specifically because [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1450.44s)]
*  it's a domination thing over the man. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1454.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1456.84s)]
*  You're not going to curry favor amongst the community. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1457.6399999999999s)]
*  I've heard it's not even just rappers. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1460.1999999999998s)]
*  It's anybody he meets. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1461.8799999999999s)]
*  It could be a fucking executive at a bank that he's working with. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1463.72s)]
*  If he got a wife, I'm going to try to fuck this guy's wife. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1467.1599999999999s)]
*  Or girl, whatever. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1470.36s)]
*  This is allegedly the Bobby Altz thing. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1471.24s)]
*  That's sick, bro. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1472.52s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. Tell me. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  This is like the rumor with this. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1474.84s)]
*  Again, no one knows. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1476.1999999999998s)]
*  But like, she does the pod with him. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1477.08s)]
*  They're in the bed together doing the pod, right? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1479.56s)]
*  Goes crazy viral. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  And then she breaks up with her husband shortly thereafter. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1482.12s)]
*  And then there's all the speculation that he smashed and it caused an issue with the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1485.8s)]
*  relationship. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  No one knows of this trip. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1490.4399999999998s)]
*  This is like the rumor on there. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1491.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1492.36s)]
*  Also, the guy she filed for divorce. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1493.3999999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1495.96s)]
*  The husband filed for divorce. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1496.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1498.04s)]
*  I mean, so yeah, listen, it just seems to me like when everybody in the industry, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1498.84s)]
*  not a single person will stand up for you. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1506.28s)]
*  So not one person has spoken out. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1507.8799999999999s)]
*  Nope. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1509.88s)]
*  To me, that means you don't have a lot of people in the industry that care about you [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1511.0800000000002s)]
*  winning. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1516.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1516.92s)]
*  Everybody seems to want a feature from Drake. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1518.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1520.68s)]
*  So I'm like, how is he not built up this like great rapport with everybody? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1521.16s)]
*  He's handing out features to everybody. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1525.4s)]
*  They get these number one singles. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1526.92s)]
*  Like I'm looking at this from the outside. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1528.2s)]
*  You know, I mean, I'm a solo casual. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1529.8000000000002s)]
*  But I'm like, wow, this is fucked up. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1534.0400000000002s)]
*  This guy puts so many people on and nobody's standing up for him. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1535.96s)]
*  Like, this is crazy. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1539.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1540.6s)]
*  And then I start to hear little rumblings and I'll protect some sources of like [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1541.24s)]
*  this type of behavior, which is like, how do I, how do I? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1545.8s)]
*  Apparently, he'll kind of do you dirty on a deal sometimes. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1549.32s)]
*  But also, that's fair to me to a degree, to a degree. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1551.6399999999999s)]
*  If you're that big and you're helping out this guy, you can at least expect some level of, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1556.9199999999998s)]
*  all right, he's going to be a little whatever. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1561.08s)]
*  To get to the top, a lot of times people have to have a singular focus of self. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1562.2s)]
*  And that is beneficial in their efforts to reach, you know, the peak, the zenith, if you will. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1566.84s)]
*  But that does come at a cost. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1577.8799999999999s)]
*  It comes at a cost as when you're being attacked, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1579.96s)]
*  people remember those times where you only thought about yourself. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1581.8s)]
*  Well, again, the deal thing, I think most of us would be like, whatever, dude, he's the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1584.68s)]
*  fucking, he's a billionaire, he's the biggest artist in the world, whatever. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1589.0s)]
*  I think where people start jumping off board is, okay, you're going to do them grimey in a deal, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1591.4s)]
*  fine. But if you're trying to holler at dude's wives, if you're ruining marriages, just like, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1595.24s)]
*  you're Drake, you can fuck a lot of unmarried girls. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1599.96s)]
*  I also think the community finally, well, hip hop finally looked at all Drake's actions, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1602.36s)]
*  all the things you guys said, but plus him jumping out of different genres and roles and accents. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1611.24s)]
*  Yeah, Kendrick, Atlanta, but dude, the not like us, the most damning thing that's like, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1618.6s)]
*  oh, this is just, I don't need evidence for this is the Atlanta thing. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1622.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1625.64s)]
*  When he's just like, you just use these Atlanta rappers to get your currency up, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1626.1200000000001s)]
*  you're a colonizer. That was the one where you're like, oh, fuck, he's providing evidence on all of [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1629.5600000000002s)]
*  this. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1634.44s)]
*  And it's like, we've seen it, we've seen his accent change, but we just like, excuse it because the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1634.68s)]
*  song's hot. So just like, whatever. But like, if you really just start to see how often he switches [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1639.3200000000002s)]
*  from this role to that role, to this accent, to that accent. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1644.8400000000001s)]
*  The accents and changing is one thing for sure, but he's not the first artist to like pocket [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1648.52s)]
*  people who are popping and elevate themselves in that way. That is a common trend just with artists. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1655.08s)]
*  Jay-Z did this better than anybody in history. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1659.3999999999999s)]
*  But he's remained Jay-Z while doing it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1661.8799999999999s)]
*  But think about it, Jay-Z by himself, with all due respect, the greatest at the craft [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1663.8s)]
*  has never been like, he's never been an arena act. Like he could do the arenas in New York, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1668.52s)]
*  he could do it, but whenever he did the big tour, it's, all right, I'm gonna bring Justin with me. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1673.8799999999999s)]
*  Or I'm gonna bring Ye with me, I'm gonna bring whatever. He is the master at like finding heat [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1677.8s)]
*  and then bring himself alongside. And what he provides is the stamp of cool. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1681.96s)]
*  Jay-Z is cool. Like that is what the world sees him at. He is the best at the craft and everybody [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1688.12s)]
*  wants to be associated at that. But if he sees Justin rumbling, he's like, all right, let me get [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1692.6s)]
*  this motherfucker right here. So I think Drake has also done a brilliant job of building people up [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1696.2s)]
*  in that way. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1702.44s)]
*  But it's the reverse in that Jay is kind of using, he's trying to get white fans and making [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1703.0s)]
*  himself more marketable and white people don't care about that. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  Jay's done it with black people too. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1712.52s)]
*  But Jay is a drug dealer from Bed-Stuy. You're not gonna tell Jay he didn't grow up in the culture. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1713.9599999999998s)]
*  Whatever 90s hip hop culture was, that motherfucker lived it. My initial feeling on Drake was, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1723.08s)]
*  oh, this seems like a, I'm a kid who grew up in white suburbs. And I said this to y'all, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1729.6399999999999s)]
*  you were gone. I saw him as a black kid who grew up in white suburbs. And I saw the way [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1733.1599999999999s)]
*  white people treated those black guys often. And you could tell the ones that were like really [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1737.48s)]
*  enjoying it and soaking it up. And then I would see those same guys with my black friends who [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1741.24s)]
*  grew up with black people. And they would be like, no, I don't work with this guy. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  Drake seemed to do that, but then kind of like help these guys out so that enough black people, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1748.9199999999998s)]
*  he got enough cosines of black people were like, oh yeah, it's fine. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1753.1599999999999s)]
*  I think a little part of that also is that there are three cultural hubs for hip hop music. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1756.44s)]
*  And they are New York, California, and Atlanta. Now that's not to say that Houston, it's not to [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1765.0s)]
*  say that New Orleans haven't had moments, but we're talking about the cultural hubs that define the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1770.52s)]
*  genre of rap. It's LA, New York, Atlanta. Toronto, because Drake is the biggest artist in the world, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1775.8s)]
*  especially in the genre, has built up so much cache, but it was never a director of cultural [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1783.08s)]
*  within rap. So Drake very intelligently has built those ties to Atlanta. He obviously built with [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1791.08s)]
*  Houston and even built, I think in LA, right? I mean, like there's guys that he connected with, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1797.96s)]
*  definitely even connected in Chicago when Chicago's having that moment, right? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1802.6799999999998s)]
*  So he's very intelligent was like, I need the stamp of approval from the cultural movers, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1805.88s)]
*  the real people who are shaking the world of hip hop. Drake defines hip hop in a lot of ways, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1814.2s)]
*  and there's so many people trying to beat Drake, but I wouldn't say the city of Toronto defines [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1820.1200000000001s)]
*  hip hop. Does that make sense? Whereas like future, like I imagine future is bigger in Atlanta [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1824.8400000000001s)]
*  than any artist. You know what I mean? Like he has the influence. He's bigger than Drake in [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1832.04s)]
*  Atlanta. He's God in Atlanta. Yeah. And like same with Kendrick, like Kendrick in LA. So I think [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1838.2s)]
*  it was a smart move, but also a necessary move. Like imagine you're this person who's complete [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1846.36s)]
*  outsider and like what he's done in terms of building up Toronto and the scene and thinking [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1850.52s)]
*  of it as a place for music is amazing. And it doesn't hurt the fact that the biggest pop artist [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1854.6s)]
*  in the world, The Weeknd is also from Toronto at the same fucking time. So Toronto is definitely [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1860.2s)]
*  having a moment, but I think in terms of the way the culture moves, he was very smart to partner [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1865.96s)]
*  with these people. Yeah. He needed that. No, nobody said it was dumb. Yeah. I just wish he [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1871.32s)]
*  stayed himself. Like when he first came out, he was like vulnerable, kind of nerdy dude that [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1876.52s)]
*  sang. And then all of a sudden around like, if you're reading this too late, all of a sudden [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1884.3600000000001s)]
*  he's a gangster. And like he kind of, that's where people were like, you're not this guy. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1889.64s)]
*  That's where they feel like it's vulture. I guess I'm such a casual. I didn't know that he [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1894.68s)]
*  tried to present himself as like a tough guy. He's always singing and shit. Like I didn't know that. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1898.6000000000001s)]
*  He's like talking about getting people touched. Like he became a gangster. And I'm not even going [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1903.0s)]
*  to say that he's not because I hear stories in Toronto where it's like him and his crew, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1907.64s)]
*  if they want to do something, they'll do something. But people just look at it. It's like, who are you? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1912.76s)]
*  You're not that guy. You just were upset of people making fun of you for so long that it's like, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1917.72s)]
*  now you became the villain. Interesting. And it's like, and I think he'll, he'll do that with [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1922.6000000000001s)]
*  everything. Like even when he was doing like Afro beats and all that. And now like, why are you [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1927.8s)]
*  talking Jamaican? But then, or like even make an accent, but then people were like, no, that's [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1931.72s)]
*  really how he talks. He was just hiding it for so long in the beginning so he can break through [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1936.44s)]
*  into the American market. So we get introduced to him with a fake voice. And now when he starts [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1941.64s)]
*  talking regular, we're like, yo, what is this? What is this shit? You know, and then there's also the, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1948.44s)]
*  I don't know, this is the video. This is what people are, another thing people are hating on [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1953.16s)]
*  is the video of him on like some reality show with white people talking about how ignorant the [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1956.2800000000002s)]
*  Toronto slang is. He's like, that's ignorant to me. So like we don't know the real you. That's what [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1960.44s)]
*  I'm saying. Nobody knows real. Even the thug shit. I've heard Drake will have his people get at you. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1965.0s)]
*  You go to LA, they're like, Kendrick is a guy by himself. He don't, I mean like, if you're a boss, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1971.0s)]
*  like you're not getting your hands dirty. I guess, I just, I guess to again, a suburb kid who reads [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1977.24s)]
*  him as a suburb guy, we can hire people to do things for us. That doesn't mean we're doing [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1983.24s)]
*  things. You know what I mean? Like you got money, you can get, I could be a boss if I got money. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1987.4s)]
*  That's just hiring goons. It's not like you grew up in it. You represent a thing. Yeah, he didn't put [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1991.4s)]
*  work in, but yeah, that's what black people say. I knew there was a black people thing there. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=1996.28s)]
*  He is just way more gangster than he used to be. And so we just seen, I guess, finally holding the [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2002.44s)]
*  mirror up to who Drake actually is. And now we don't know. And now I think that's why people [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2012.2s)]
*  are just like, ah, I don't think we like this guy. I wonder if there's a little bit of it, like [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2017.0s)]
*  he's someone who is an outsider to hip hop just by nature of like how he grew up and where he's from. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2022.52s)]
*  Just by being from Canada. That's it. And he just put out such fucking incredible music over and [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2032.04s)]
*  over and over again that the people are just like, Hey, we got to give it up. This guy's fucking nice [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2039.72s)]
*  at rapping, amazing shows. Like he's just the best. But there's that little piece of the American [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2045.08s)]
*  fan base, the American hip hop fan, this like, he's not, he's not really us, but he's so nice, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2052.7599999999998s)]
*  we got to give it up. But the second he gets knocked off the pedestal, all those people are like, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2059.48s)]
*  see, I knew it. You know what I mean? A little bit of that. But then also when he does the things [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2064.44s)]
*  like sleeping with somebody's girl. Exactly. You're not building up any protection. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2070.2s)]
*  And beefing with Meg or whatever stuff. It's like, yo, wait, don't beef with somebody from our culture. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2074.2799999999997s)]
*  Remember who you are. He's a beloved outsider. According to Kendrick, he's a fan. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2080.3599999999997s)]
*  So you're a beloved outsider and you're on top and people are like tolerated because they can't [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2087.3999999999996s)]
*  deny it. The music is so fucking good. But every misstep, they are there to remind you that you're [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2092.3599999999997s)]
*  a fucking outsider. Taking shots at Meg was wild. Also, he has lied about, dude, everybody in Kendrick's [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2097.4s)]
*  camp and then you talk to some people out in LA, anybody that knows anything about it is like, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2103.88s)]
*  no, that daughter is real. They're like, I'll die on that. That daughter is real. So if we find out [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2106.92s)]
*  he lied about that, he lied about Adonis at first, he lied about Ghost Riders at first. If he's lying [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2111.64s)]
*  about this, how do we believe anything you lie about? He lied about leaking the information. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2115.64s)]
*  He was like, we leaked that information to you on the hard part six. Apparently that's a lie. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2121.2400000000002s)]
*  Academics said that wasn't true. So at what point is everything about you fraudulent and we can't [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2125.5600000000004s)]
*  believe a fucking word that comes out of your mouth ever. It's tough. If that daughter shit is real [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2131.2400000000002s)]
*  and it leaks, that's a real problem. How do you prove the daughter thing? That's the thing. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2136.6800000000003s)]
*  Paternity tests? She would have to come out for seven years or whatever. If she's 11 and 18, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2141.32s)]
*  she could be like, fuck whatever bag my mom got. This is what happened to Jerry Jones. Jerry Jones [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2145.32s)]
*  paid off some airline gate attendant or something that he got pregnant. Oh, but the kid is not [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2149.6400000000003s)]
*  quiet. And then the kid is suing. She's like, I was that was in utero when she made that deal. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2154.7599999999998s)]
*  I had nothing to do with that deal. Not only was I not 18, I was not even born. So I want to be a [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2159.64s)]
*  part of this family. Fuck you. And that's a smart move. Kids want rights. Come on, bro. Feed us a [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2164.7599999999998s)]
*  ton of rights. You can't sue. Yeah, but that's that could theoretically happen. I mean, by that point [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2170.3599999999997s)]
*  it'll be so far gone. It's not even like a maybe it won't matter. Or it could be some ditty shit. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2177.0s)]
*  The great thing of also sleeping with everyone's girls is so smart because the guys won't say [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2181.56s)]
*  anything. Yeah, this is what he said last time. And it was a great point when you look at the guy [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2185.56s)]
*  and be like, man, these just bitches. They just hoes, bro. You really care about these hoes. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2189.72s)]
*  And then you can't as a rapper be like, no, I had feelings for him. That still bothered me. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2193.16s)]
*  Like Wayne's girl while he was in prison, crazy dog. That's the guy that put you on, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2197.56s)]
*  even if it's just one of his girls. And let's put it this way. It's fucked over her too. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2202.04s)]
*  Oh, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Like don't fuck. But how's it going to be whole? So I can blame [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2206.68s)]
*  Tammy. What's that? That's the way in bar, which we people I think are saying that was about [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2211.8799999999997s)]
*  hoes going to be hoes. So I couldn't blame Tammy. But he says in the video where he acknowledges [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2216.2s)]
*  that happened, he's like, she tries to text me. Don't get at me. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody even if she [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2220.44s)]
*  throws it at you, you go, yo, you are my man's girl. Get the fuck out of the fuck away from me. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2224.2799999999997s)]
*  He's probably a little sex addiction situation. Yeah. Listen, power manifests. It's like a [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2230.12s)]
*  hunger for power manifests itself in different ways. And he presents himself as like this really [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2235.16s)]
*  just kind of like smart, composed, like thoughtful businessman, right? Outside of the character that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2240.12s)]
*  is the rapper. Right. All the business deals are like fucking amazing. So funny when he wants to [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2245.8799999999997s)]
*  be funny. Like, yeah, savvy how he is. Fantastic. But that maniacal drive might present itself [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2251.72s)]
*  somewhere. And if you're fucking your friends, girls, you're not fucking them for them, by the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2260.04s)]
*  way. Because there's tons of bad bitches. You're not just doing to get a nut. You are doing it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2266.6s)]
*  You're fucking your man. Yeah. That's what you're doing. You're fucking your man. It sounds crazy. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2271.48s)]
*  Yes, did he. But it sounds crazy. But that's what it's about. It's like, like fucking him over or [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2278.6s)]
*  just like wanting to have something over him. But I don't think he's thinking about. No, no, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2283.96s)]
*  no, not like sexually. It's like I'm going to emotionally fuck you. I'm going to do something [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2289.4s)]
*  that I know that I'm going to have over you. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yes. You're going to think about me [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2293.96s)]
*  for the rest of it. That's what he jumps to in every song. Dominating you. Like it is a and that [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2297.96s)]
*  if you can't control that compulsion. Yeah. It's also his go to in, you know, hey, Whitney holler [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2303.64s)]
*  at me. I'll treat you better when I do whatever. It's like, yeah, that's his go to thing. But and [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2309.8s)]
*  then I was like really thinking about it. I was like, he doesn't really have too many things he [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2314.68s)]
*  can talk about because if he doesn't truly know who he is, like what more can you say in rap about [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2318.9199999999996s)]
*  bragging about money and fucking girls? Well, the drink, even as a Drake hater, the thing I could [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2325.0s)]
*  never deny when he started is he's like rapping about being heartbroken and shit like that. And [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2328.3599999999997s)]
*  then again, in the beginning, I was like, well, I can't live through this. It's not for me. But [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2332.2s)]
*  God bless you. That's like a thing. Rap could probably use. And then all those girls that [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2335.3999999999996s)]
*  broke his heart in the beginning turned him into a fucking psycho. It is their fault. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2340.44s)]
*  I was trying to blame them. I was trying to blame them. I mean, I ain't fucking my friends girls. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2345.2400000000002s)]
*  He was a little resentful. I ain't fucking my friends girls. But I think that played a little [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2352.68s)]
*  bit of part of it because women, I feel in the beginning of Drake's career, he used to be a joke. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2358.84s)]
*  You remember how girls used to talk about Drake? No, explain. Like I feel. Sorry to add to this, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2363.32s)]
*  you know, this meme there, Drake, the type of dude who is the N word, but Drake, the type of dude who [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2368.44s)]
*  doesn't bend his knees when he ties his shoes. It was like all these really funny. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2374.04s)]
*  Women used to look at him as like soft and like, like a beta male. So I think he, that bothered him [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2377.64s)]
*  of looking at that way. And then he like started living the lie and became now I'm fucking all you [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2385.8s)]
*  I'm getting back at all. He should have leaked his dick 10 years ago. Everyone shut everyone up, bro. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2393.56s)]
*  You wouldn't see it. Every girl would be like, all right. I'm surprised it didn't leak [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2398.52s)]
*  before because he sends it up. Well, apparently, well, Kettergen, his, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2402.68s)]
*  I didn't know that, but in his, his meet the grits video. It's a prosthetic. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2407.72s)]
*  To make it look smaller. No, no way. Like an old school illusion. Yeah, it's prosthetic. To make it [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2414.2799999999997s)]
*  look smaller. It's like one of them, you know, clown house mirrors or whatever. They do that to [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2418.76s)]
*  make it look tinier and skinnier. Snapchat should make that filter. That is from Snapchat. One of [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2423.4s)]
*  those filters. Yeah. So you can have a really tiny looking dick. He's got spanks for his dick. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2429.5600000000004s)]
*  Didn't you think that his dick looked really like malnourished? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2434.6000000000004s)]
*  Don't you think it looked malnourished when you saw it compared to when you want to give it 10 cents a [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2440.76s)]
*  day? Why do so many bugs fly around his dick? It needed unicef. Dick make afro beats. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2444.44s)]
*  No, but it's so tiny. So, all right guys, let's take a break for a second because today [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2456.68s)]
*  we are going to help you take your health back. Okay. You are going to monitor everything going [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2461.56s)]
*  on with your body. You are going to get into peak physical condition. And the first step [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2469.4s)]
*  for that happening is getting yourself a whoop. Okay. Make sure you get that sleep. I'm telling [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2474.92s)]
*  you something happens when you put on this whoop where you start to get competitive. And the first [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2480.44s)]
*  thing that I was competitive about was sleep. Okay. I wanted that a hundred percent sleep score. It was [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2484.6s)]
*  a challenge since I just had a baby and that's literally virtually impossible, but you start [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2493.0s)]
*  finding things you can do. You're like, okay, do I reduce my drinking? Can I get there with drinking? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2497.88s)]
*  Ooh, that's an interesting one. Can I have two glasses of wine and still get a hundred percent? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2503.0s)]
*  I got to really sleep today. I got, baby, sorry, I can't wake up with our child. I got to get my [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2507.7200000000003s)]
*  a hundred percent. I got to sleep. I'm telling you right now, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. There it is. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2512.6s)]

*  What type of good sleep, what type of exercise is going to monitor your health. It's going to [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2523.8s)]
*  put your brain in that situation where you are constantly calculating the things that you're [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2528.84s)]
*  going to do, that you're doing that are good for your body. That is the change. It's not just about [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2534.04s)]
*  getting data. It starts to make you competitive about being more healthy. This just naturally [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2538.2000000000003s)]
*  happens when you start wearing it. Once you apply it to yourself, you know exactly what I'm talking [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2543.2400000000002s)]
*  about. You put it on your wrist. You don't have to change anything about your life. And the fact [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2547.2400000000002s)]
*  that you're getting this feedback makes you go, oh no, I'm going to beat that. It gamifies health. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2551.48s)]
*  It's no different than playing Mario Kart, Nintendo Switch. You want to learn how to drift. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2556.52s)]

*  All right, guys, we got to take a break so I can tell you about Helix mattresses. They are fantastic. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2581.48s)]
*  I have one. My sleep has legitimately improved on a Helix mattress. My wife fucking loves it, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2586.04s)]
*  sleeps like a baby. My dog even loves it. And the reason they are so easy to love is because they [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2591.08s)]
*  match you to the mattress that best fits your sleeping habits. Side sleeper, stomach sleeper, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2596.12s)]
*  back sleeper, whatever it is, how much do you toss and turn at night? You take a quiz online [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2602.36s)]
*  that takes two minutes. Have your partner take one as well and they will match you to the mattress [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2606.6s)]
*  that best fits your sleeping habits. Then it shipped right to your door, free shipping. And [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2611.56s)]
*  most importantly, you have 100 nights to try it out. That's right. You have more than three months [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2616.6s)]
*  to sleep on this thing. See if you love it. And if you don't, you can send it back and get a refund. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2621.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you do love it, which you probably will, you get a 10 to 15 year warranty on the bed. Guys, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2625.88s)]
*  there is truly nothing to lose. If you don't believe me, look up Helix online. They win [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2630.36s)]
*  fucking awards for best mattresses. I didn't know they had those, but they win them. And they have [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2634.36s)]
*  over 12,000 five star reviews. They are phenomenal. And just as importantly, Helix is offering 20% [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2638.28s)]
*  off of all mattresses and two free pillows for our listeners. So flagrant fans, asshole army, go to [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2644.28s)]

*  best offer yet for real. I remember we did ads for them a few years ago. That offer, not as good as [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2660.12s)]
*  this one, and it won't last long most likely because it's the best. So get Helix. Better Sleep starts [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2665.08s)]
*  now with Helix. Let's get back to the show. Something else we said today that, yeah, apparently this dude [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2671.72s)]
*  said he fed, he actually fed Drake fake information on Kendrick. Yeah. Apparently I forgot his name. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2678.2s)]
*  I forget his name, but the, you know, Drake was like Whitney's you guys, you and Whitney are having [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2684.44s)]
*  problems. The kid might not be yours. He paid some other guy 100k for info on Kendrick. And the guy [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2688.04s)]
*  was like, hey, him and Whitney are having problems and the kid might not be his. And then Drake ran [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2693.64s)]
*  with that. And then the guy just made it up. He said, I was laughing at him the whole time [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2699.88s)]
*  that song came out. According to this tweet, I didn't listen to all these do coolly Bravo. Apparently [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2703.08s)]
*  he's like cool. Kendrick, he did a recent interview. He's got like 3 million views on Twitter right now. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2706.7599999999998s)]
*  Drake paid him 150k for information on Kendrick's wife. Whitney admits he gave Drake false [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2711.32s)]
*  information. He says he was laughing when he heard family matters. Now if I'm Kendrick, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2715.88s)]
*  I'm tight about that. You had the whole world thinking that my wife did this thing. He also, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2721.6400000000003s)]
*  because of the fake information that you leaked, but he also put it out. Wouldn't you be upset if [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2726.36s)]
*  you're in euphoria? He said, you're going to make up lies on my family. It just ended up proving him [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2731.6400000000003s)]
*  right. So I think he was like, I don't think the perception is that at all lies about his family [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2736.04s)]
*  is based off of stuff that came out in his latest album. Oh, Mr. Morales. Yeah. So I don't think he [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2741.8s)]
*  didn't think he was going to go there with it. Maybe not. And I don't know if he's a Kendrick [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2750.1200000000003s)]
*  friend or whatever. I mean, like, let's just say you, you released information, fake information [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2754.6000000000004s)]
*  to my op and they wrote a song about it. It would never be that. I'd be like, bro, why'd you release [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2762.52s)]
*  that? Say it. You know what I mean? Say my dick is too big. Exactly. That one. Yeah. It hurts everyone. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2766.92s)]
*  Yeah. It can't fit in anywhere. It's so big. Put it into a potted plant. Yeah. Say that. But no, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2773.16s)]
*  I think it's capital. Until I see some proof, like let me see either bank transaction or some [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2778.04s)]
*  text like, yo, whatever. I need to see some, cause this guy's just capitalizing. Cause you asked what [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2783.7200000000003s)]
*  he said about Drake saying he fed it to Kendrick. You don't have any proofs. That's fair. No, it's [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2788.44s)]
*  beef season. Yo. Yeah. Everybody mad. Who you beefing with? Everybody. Son, we're not beefing [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2792.52s)]
*  with nobody. We just, we need to start. We got to protect our, no, we're J. Colin dog. We're J. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2797.16s)]
*  Colin. Oh, no, no, no. We're protecting our peace. I'd rather you be a pedophile. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2801.48s)]
*  We got to protect our peace. Can we talk about, can we talk about, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2809.48s)]
*  can we talk about Shaq Diesel and uncle Shannon going at it? Yeah. Yeah. I don't like this. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2813.64s)]
*  Okay. So what happened with Shannon? Shannon said some shit about Shaq. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2820.04s)]
*  Heats. Shaq told me, I didn't hear it. I just, yeah. So basically Shaq said to Nicole Yocich [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2824.44s)]
*  on an interview after he won the MVP, I thought shy should have won it. I'll be honest with you. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2832.2s)]
*  I think you're great. I just thought shy Gilgis Alexander or whatever. She should have won the [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2836.2s)]
*  MVP. And then Shannon, I guess he basically said about Shaq jealous. Yeah. You're jealous. You don't [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2841.7200000000003s)]
*  like, you didn't have the low post moves in Nicole had or whatever. And then Shaq just went [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2848.52s)]
*  bonkers on him. Just dunked on him. He went, I mean, can we, can I see some of the dunking? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2853.0s)]
*  Cause I didn't. Okay. See was the number one seed. Yeah. Shea is the best player on the team. He [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2859.24s)]
*  had a remarkable season. Yeah. Like I don't think it's a crazy hot take to think that he should have [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2865.32s)]
*  won MVP. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I think this is, it's funny. People are saying I was racist to give [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2870.92s)]
*  Nicole the MVP this year. I think they made up for the fact that they gave Joellen B the MVP last [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2875.64s)]
*  year because everybody was saying it's a racist how he always wins MVP. Then we watched the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2881.16s)]
*  playoffs play out and we were like, why the fuck did Joellen B win the MVP? This is idiotic. Yeah. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2885.64s)]
*  So I almost think writers are like, fuck, we owe him one. And then maybe I didn't watch nearly as [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2890.6s)]
*  much basketball this year, but they're, I think. That does happen though. That happened with Jordan. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2894.92s)]
*  Like when, when, when I think it was Carl Malone won the MVP. Yeah. It's like no time when Jordan [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2898.8399999999997s)]
*  is in the league and we're not counting the wizards. Should any other player gotten the MVP? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2904.28s)]
*  Yeah. Not even close. Yeah. It's not, it's not even a conversation, but you get fatigue [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2909.0s)]
*  from the constant dominance. Yeah. Yeah. Voting fatigue. Yeah. It's just like, okay, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2913.32s)]
*  we're looking for someone else to be great in this moment. It's not to say Carl Malone wasn't great. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2918.44s)]
*  Vitali should have done a stream about him probably. But the reality is, is like, no, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2922.6000000000004s)]
*  no one's coming close to it. And I don't know. I gotta watch more. I gotta watch more of Jokic. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2928.76s)]
*  Third MVP in four seasons. I mean, he's just so fucking good and like not exciting necessarily, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2934.6800000000003s)]
*  but just plays it his, they say that about Luca plays it at his own pace. I feel like Nicola [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2942.6000000000004s)]
*  is just calm. There's no franticness about it whatsoever. And he's going to make the right [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2947.48s)]
*  decision a thousand times out of a thousand and one. And it, the team dominates. He's got every [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2951.5600000000004s)]
*  skill on offense works his ass off. Yeah. They're the best. Even coming back against Minnesota. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2957.32s)]
*  There it's too old now. We thought they were dead in the water and then you just watch the game. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2962.92s)]
*  Did you read their messages back and forth to each other? No, sorry. Just like, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2967.6400000000003s)]
*  you took me sticking up for shies as jealousy of Joker shows how smart you are. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2971.8s)]
*  Remember if you're not ranked in the top 10 of your profession, you can't speak to me. Don't [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2976.84s)]
*  forget how I know what you did to get to where you're at. Me jealous sounds like you're jealous. I [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2980.44s)]
*  know you're trying to stay relevant by gossiping on your podcast. Four rings, three finals, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2984.84s)]
*  MVP's top 50, top 75, Google me. And to be frank, and it just goes on and on and on. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2989.48s)]
*  Most dominant ever. And then Shannon responds and he's like, I love you Shaq, but damn you don't [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=2994.6000000000004s)]
*  need, you need to get some thicker skin. Don't take offense to everything. Then just say stuff [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3000.44s)]
*  like four rings. That's an argument of a 10 year old. No wonder Phil talked about how much you had [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3004.2000000000003s)]
*  to accommodate you and your feelings. With that being said, you're a generational whiner. This [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3007.32s)]
*  man child needs therapy. You don't see any of this big man counterparts, belittling previous [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3010.84s)]
*  and future generations to stop with insecure bullying. It's fucking embarrassing for a 50 year [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3014.6s)]
*  old man. Don't forget. You told me that you're still illiterate and you can't last more than 30 [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3018.2s)]
*  seconds in the bedroom. That's why your ex-wife wasn't in love with you. Damn Shannon. Son, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3022.36s)]
*  this is fucking drinking Kendrick right here. Apparently Shaq dropped a diss track. Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3027.56s)]
*  Yeah. What is happening? When the fuck did all this happen? I didn't hear about nothing. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3034.6s)]
*  Shannon, you're wrong, bro. I feel like you're biased. I'm not biased at all. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3038.92s)]
*  Shannon, you are wrong. You are wrong, bro. Shaq the motherfucking goat, the most dominant ever. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3045.32s)]
*  I love you Shaq. Until Shannon, you say something really nice and beautiful. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3050.6s)]
*  All I see is dollars on. They come in in 3D. Make it hot. Ain't no way around my degree. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3068.92s)]
*  You are not in my spot. You are like a B-Wing. You know I got them calling me Rockies the way [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3075.32s)]
*  I reread. I get to the greenback. I don't need a lawnmower. Chess line. Foreign drives and dicks. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3080.2000000000003s)]
*  Yo, remember what I said about Metro earlier? I feel that way about Shaq now. Shaq might be [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3087.56s)]
*  the greatest musician in history. Shout out Shaq. You got the best opinions. You're the best at [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3092.92s)]
*  basketball. I feel like you're only saying this because Shaq said that you're the Shaq of comedy. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3097.4s)]
*  He did? Yeah. Get out of here. I feel like, who way? He said that about me. He just made the only [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3103.4s)]
*  last 30 seconds in bed. Shaq, we got so much in common that you don't even realize. Mr. TMB. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3109.8s)]
*  It's crazy. You are TMB. I'm telling you, we are one in the same, my brother. We are one in the same. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3117.56s)]
*  You changed the game because of us. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3123.8s)]
*  No, but that was fire. That was fire. No, no. Shaq's a fucking man. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3128.1200000000003s)]
*  Shannon out his goddamn mind. Why is everyone so mad right now? Why is everyone beefing? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3132.28s)]

*  anti-Semitism that they already have. And there are other people that are latching on just because [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3319.48s)]

*  mascot for the team. We got to start calling it, that's fire. Dude, if you're a little anti-Semitic. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3384.68s)]
*  What happened to globalists? We really dropped that. We got to bring back globalists. Yeah, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3389.64s)]
*  globalists is fire. Anyway, his speech was actually really good. Yeah. I thought his [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3394.7599999999998s)]
*  speech was really cool. Maybe there's like a, my wife sent it to me on TikTok, but I'm sure [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3398.52s)]
*  there's like a longer version of it. But he just talked about like the three things in life that [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3403.24s)]
*  his three like lessons for life. I thought they were really good. His pod with Neil was really [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3408.52s)]
*  great too. Say again? His pod with Neil was really good. Yeah. So yeah, maybe I was wrong. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3413.8s)]
*  I basically said though, like you could- I'm willing to forgive him if he apologizes. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3419.0s)]
*  I'm willing to forgive him if he apologizes for that thing that he has no clue that he did 15 [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3422.92s)]
*  years ago. He liked your office. He sat in there. It was a good time. Yeah, you know what I mean? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3426.6s)]
*  Damn, he took the office. I know he took your shit. He took the office. That wasn't his, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3432.2799999999997s)]
*  but he just decided to set up shop. These blue devils. Honestly, the protesters might've been [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3436.2s)]
*  onto something. The protesters might've been onto something. These blue devils. All right. So I have [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3441.96s)]
*  the video of his speech. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3447.48s)]
*  Oh, I see what happened. This ship sank. Now I understand why it never made it into port. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3507.48s)]
*  If the fish where you are have eyes like Shelley Duvall and a bendy straw with a work light hanging [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3514.36s)]
*  off their head, you do not belong there. If the fish are going, I can't see a goddamn thing, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3519.32s)]
*  you won't either. Number three, fall in love. It's easy to fall in love with people. I suggest [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3525.88s)]
*  falling in love with anything and everything, every chance you get. Fall in love with your [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3532.28s)]
*  hockey, your sneakers, your blue zone parking space. I've had a lot of fun in life, falling in [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3537.1600000000003s)]
*  love with stupid, meaningless physical objects. The object I love the most is the clear barrel [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3542.36s)]
*  pick 10, a dollar 29 for a box of 10. I can fall in love with the car turn signal switch that has [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3546.52s)]
*  a nice feel to it. A pizza crust that collapses with just the right amount of pressure. I have [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3551.96s)]
*  truly spent my life focusing on the smallest things imaginable, completely oblivious to all [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3556.52s)]
*  the big issues of living. Find something where you love the good parts and don't mind the bad [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3561.8s)]
*  parts too much. The torture you're comfortable with. This is the golden path to victory in life. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3567.6400000000003s)]
*  Work, exercise, relationships, they all have a solid component of pure torture and they are all [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3574.04s)]
*  1000% worth it. Privilege is a word that has taken quite a beating lately. Privilege today [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3580.04s)]
*  seems to be the worst thing you can have. I would like to take a moment to defend it. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3586.04s)]
*  Again, a lot of you are thinking, I can't believe they invited this guy. Too late. I say, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3590.44s)]
*  use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3598.12s)]
*  a comedian. If I messed up a funny story around my relatives, they would know that's not how you [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3602.68s)]
*  tell that joke. The prostitutes has to be behind the drapes when the wife comes in. You went to [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3611.4s)]
*  Duke. That is an unbelievable privilege. I know how an honorary doctorate, if you made letters [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3617.16s)]
*  degree from Duke University and if I can figure out a way to use that, I will. I haven't figured [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3621.8799999999997s)]
*  anything out yet. I think it's pretty much as useful in real life as this outfit I'm wearing. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3627.64s)]
*  That's a lot. I'll take it. My point is we're embarrassed about things we should be proud of [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3633.48s)]
*  and proud of things we should be embarrassed about. I was writing on TV series. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3638.04s)]
*  That was a good speech. There's a really better part. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3642.28s)]
*  No, I want to hear the part, but I thought what was really interesting is falling in love with [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3661.88s)]
*  these little things and how valuable that can be and how much joy can come to your life from that. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3665.32s)]
*  It's very easy to just focus on the biggest things that are happening in the world. What are the [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3670.44s)]
*  biggest issues? What do I need to get done? What should I care about when there are things that we [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3674.36s)]
*  absolutely love right in front of us that might make no sense to anybody else, but those things [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3679.8s)]
*  are going to end up bringing us maybe equal joy, maybe more joy, and just getting upset. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3684.2000000000003s)]
*  The other thing I love was just working hard. Swing the bat. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3691.4s)]
*  Even if you don't know what you're doing, just work hard and fucking take the chance and swing. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3697.48s)]
*  It was great. I thought it was good. Also, looking at the things you have as a privilege. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3704.04s)]
*  It is like to go to Duke. These kids complaining about what's going on. You're at fucking Duke. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3711.56s)]
*  You're in the top .0001% of all humans with opportunity right now. Get after it. Use it. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3716.44s)]
*  Don't feel guilty about it. Use it and go for it. Try to create a family and hopefully you can [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3722.68s)]
*  bestow some of that privilege on them and continue that and help your friends and help every person [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3727.32s)]
*  you possibly fucking can with that privilege instead of walking around embarrassed of it [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3731.4s)]
*  and trying to shut it and trying to hide it. I thought it was really good. I mean, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3735.32s)]
*  still fuck him forever. No, no, no, no. Because he did something to me. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3740.44s)]
*  You're being so anti-Semitic. I know. Why the hell do you hate this guy just [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3744.36s)]
*  because he's a Jewish kid from Brooklyn? What's wrong with you, bro? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3747.32s)]
*  That's only the main reason. It's really because he's from... [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3750.52s)]
*  Only the majority. It's from Queens. Long Island. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3755.32s)]
*  I didn't even think he's from the city. No, I thought it was Long Island. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3759.96s)]
*  Oh, motherfucker. Motherfucker. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3764.36s)]
*  Masquerade. Now you're with him? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3766.2000000000003s)]
*  He said he's a Jewish boy from New York. Are you sure he's not from Queens? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3768.6000000000004s)]
*  Isn't it all technically Long Island though? Brooklyn and Queens. Isn't that all the same island? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3773.0800000000004s)]
*  Now you're entering dangerous territory, my boy. You're not valid. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3776.6800000000003s)]
*  Entering dangerous territory, my boy. Come to Williamsburg. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3779.4s)]
*  Relax. You're from Long Island. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3783.24s)]
*  I'm going to send the goons on you. We're going to let him talk about our [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3784.36s)]
*  neighborhood. He's so far on the west side, he's from Jersey state. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3789.0s)]
*  Yeah, you are. I'm Indian. I'm proud of you. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3792.84s)]
*  That's the Jersey dog. That's the little Indian. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3795.72s)]
*  Stay in East Jersey where you at. Yo, calling? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3798.36s)]
*  You're just a kid from Long Island. I'm just a kid from Long Island. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3802.52s)]
*  What is what we can't? That's disgusting. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3808.04s)]
*  Anyway, so shout out to that whole thing. You were saying there was another part, Dev? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3810.2s)]
*  May I? From the transcript? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3815.24s)]
*  Oh, God. That was annoying. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3817.24s)]
*  We're so fucking annoying. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3819.08s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3821.64s)]
*  Seize fire now. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3821.8799999999997s)]
*  Seize fire. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3823.3999999999996s)]
*  He goes, I totally admire the ambitions of your generation to create a more [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3824.8399999999997s)]
*  just and inclusive society. I think it's also wonderful that you guys care so much about not [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3828.68s)]
*  hurting each other's feelings in the million and one ways we do all that every second of every day. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3832.3599999999997s)]
*  It's lovely to want to fix those things. But, all caps, but what I need to tell you as a comedian, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3836.6s)]
*  do not lose your sense of humor. You can have no idea at this point in your life how much you're [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3841.7999999999997s)]
*  going to need it to get through. Not enough of life makes sense for you to be able to survive [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3845.96s)]
*  it without humor. And I know all of you are here are going to use all your brains and muscle and [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3851.24s)]
*  soul to improve the world. And I know that you're going to be able to do a bang up job. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3855.48s)]
*  And when you're done, as I am now, I bet the world because of you will be a much better place, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3859.0s)]
*  but it will still not make a whole hell of a lot of sense. It will be a better, different, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3863.64s)]
*  but still pretty insane mess. And it is worth the sacrifice of an occasional discomfort to [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3868.3599999999997s)]
*  have some laughs. Don't lose that. Even if it's at the cost of occasional hard feelings, it's okay. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3872.7599999999998s)]
*  You got to laugh. That's the one thing at the end of your life that you will not wish you did less [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3877.72s)]
*  of. Humor is the most powerful, most survival essential quality you will ever have or need to [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3882.6s)]
*  navigate through the human experience. That is the one thing that you will [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3887.4s)]
*  not regret having less of. From the top, though. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3894.44s)]
*  You got to laugh. That is the one thing at the end of your life you will not wish you did less of. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3913.56s)]
*  You will not wish you did less of. Yes. In that moment at the end of the life, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3918.76s)]
*  you're not going, man, I wish I did less laughing. Yes. Every time you do it, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3923.1600000000003s)]
*  you will be grateful for it. Yeah. I like that. I like that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3927.88s)]
*  You're a great friend. Yeah. You just saved them. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3932.1200000000003s)]
*  You saved them. I am a protester. Remember what I said about, I'm really flipping a flop in the [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3934.2000000000003s)]
*  summer's out and the rainbow sandals are on. I think that those people who left Seinfeld's thing, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3944.6000000000004s)]
*  I think that they, did they leave because he is a Jew? Yeah. Can that also be right? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3953.32s)]
*  You know? Can we look into it a little bit? We can look into it. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3961.96s)]
*  Hey, can we look, hey, sometimes you hate white people, sometimes you hate black people, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3965.2400000000002s)]
*  sometimes you hate Indians. Is that okay? Yeah. Can we live in a society? What is the [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3969.64s)]
*  constitution even? Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Why do we have guns? Yes. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3974.8399999999997s)]
*  In case them blacks wanted rights. Yeah. What? Yes. Is that why? Bring back hate speech. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3978.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that, should that be what this podcast is about? Yeah. Justifying racism? Yes. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3983.4s)]
*  Should we make it that, Al? That's a good pivot. Al, you say something racist now. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3989.72s)]
*  No, I like this. Keep going. I just want it all on you. You coward! You coward! Miles, go for it! Stop! [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=3994.44s)]
*  Miles gets out of his seat. Me, me, me, me. Al, do you think when Kendrick says, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4005.96s)]
*  they not like us, it means because Drake is Jewish? Oh, gosh. Put the camera on him. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4011.48s)]
*  For them to make it about them, he's clearly talking about pedophiles. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4017.88s)]
*  As part of the Jewish religion, women do become women at 13. So, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4024.04s)]
*  I'm just, there might be, there might be a little bit of connection here. There might be a little [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4029.0s)]

*  Pereira, the Brazilian dude, you know, he goes to his like little, his old shit. Okay. Yeah. He, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4467.08s)]

*  You know, he didn't read the room, but. Yeah. So, all right. So what are we thinking? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4475.08s)]
*  People have that picture again? That shit is so. That's a wild picture. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4487.32s)]
*  How do you agree to it? I don't know. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4490.6s)]
*  A blackface for real. No, that's terrorism too. He was gaslight. This is terrorism. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4494.04s)]
*  But here's the thing that we got to ask. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4498.68s)]
*  No, this is crazy. Come on. How can you not bring that one up again? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4500.04s)]
*  He's wearing the Jim Crow shirt. Yeah. Even the T's races. Oh, no. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4510.84s)]
*  Oh my God. That's Jim Crow? Yeah. That shit look like Woody Woodpecker. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4515.0s)]
*  I mean, God damn it, Drake. That shit is too funny. But it's the same acne shit. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4519.8s)]
*  I mean. I think it's even blacker than the acne medicine. He like looks for this. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4525.8s)]
*  Wow. His white ass ears. Why didn't they do it on the ears? He didn't commit. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4533.08s)]
*  Black people don't listen. And then he gave it to Trudeau. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4537.64s)]
*  Might be a Canadian thing. Yeah. Might as well be a Canadian thing. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4545.320000000001s)]
*  All right. So here's the question. How much longer you think we care about blackface, Al? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4547.4800000000005s)]
*  Because white people, we over it. Hey, hey, hey, we moved on. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4551.96s)]
*  So what do you really think? And I know there's a lot of pressure on this question. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4557.56s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure. It depends. What time of the year? Is it Halloween or is this just [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4561.16s)]
*  a random Tuesday? That's it. So you're saying that Halloween blackface is going to be the first one [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4565.8s)]
*  where we kind of get over. Yeah. And then once it's kind of normalized there, where like kids [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4570.04s)]
*  can just dress up as whoever their hero is regardless, and we don't make a big deal of it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4574.04s)]
*  But still, if you just do blackface on a random Tuesday, I don't think nobody can get over it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4578.44s)]
*  No, you won't. But I do feel like in our lifetime, it becomes like a no, not an issue. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4582.599999999999s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck. Yeah. Right? Yeah. I think Halloween or dressing up for a costume party, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4587.639999999999s)]
*  some shit like that. Yeah. Isn't that that's kind of crazy that there is a thing that was like a [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4593.48s)]
*  incredibly vile racist act, antagonistic racist act. And then in our lifespan, we'll just be like, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4598.2s)]
*  no, but they don't mean it like that. Which they don't. When it was done, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4605.48s)]
*  initially it was. And now it's not meant as that. And I guess when enough time goes, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4610.44s)]
*  the people that were affected by those films and those like, I guess, TV shows, what was it called? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4615.4s)]
*  Minstrel. Yeah, the minstrel act. Once those people that were around for that are dead, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4621.879999999999s)]
*  and nobody watches them anymore, they'll have no connection to it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4630.2s)]
*  Like right now, like we're offended by it, because we're told that this is like a racist, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4634.52s)]
*  horrible thing. Yeah. Because it was. Yeah. But I doubt you've watched like Amos and Andy or [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4639.0s)]

*  At this phone call, my sister called me and I was in Los Angeles and said, mom and dad have been in [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4778.200000000001s)]
*  a car wreck and mother is dead and dad is dying. And I, of course, was falling apart. But I knew, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4782.12s)]
*  all I knew is I had to get there. And I got there, my sister and I, we were all sitting in this [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4792.2s)]
*  waiting room and we were sobbing. And as I'm crying, I said, my sister's here. I wasn't looking at her, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4797.08s)]
*  but I said, where was they going? And she said, to a Halloween party. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4801.4s)]
*  And I said, what were they dressed as? Stop. Why would you ask this? Why would you? And she said, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4811.4s)]
*  the odd couple. I'm thinking, what odd couple? Walter Mathow and Jack Lemmon. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4818.04s)]
*  Well, what were their costumes exactly? She said, mom was a black girl and dad was a Ku Klux Klan [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4827.24s)]
*  member. And the whole family, I guess, had heard this conversation and we all started laughing. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4832.599999999999s)]
*  And it was the greatest tribute that you could give my mother. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4842.84s)]
*  I really realized that she existed. She would continue. And she had left us with this wonderful [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4847.08s)]
*  sense of humor and this wonderful ability to laugh and cry at the same time. So I felt closer to her. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4856.84s)]
*  What? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4863.16s)]
*  Did you hear the last line? She said, I felt closer in that moment that I ever had in my whole life. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4869.96s)]
*  My whole life. The moment when she's dead. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4874.92s)]
*  I mean, her dad was committed to that character. When you crash that car. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4880.2s)]
*  I'm like, wait, think about it. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4884.12s)]
*  Why don't you tell people? These people are insane. These actors are insane. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4891.72s)]
*  They were at the hospital. No. What were they dressed as? Why would you even ask that? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4896.2s)]
*  Why would you ask that? When she said, why would I ask that? That part, I was, I'm on board. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4904.92s)]
*  Why would you ask that? And then the end just really goes off the rails. What a wonderful tribute. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4909.48s)]
*  To what? To what? A better time? Is that what you think? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4916.44s)]
*  What an all time. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4921.5599999999995s)]
*  When I tell you I cried last time, bro. Why would you share that? Why would you dress like that? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=4930.12s)]

*  What is it? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5368.32s)]
*  He's looking at him like he's proud or something like that? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5370.32s)]
*  He's acting as if he's the real Michael Jackson. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5372.32s)]
*  Watching the fake Michael Jackson. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5376.32s)]
*  So he's just like... [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5378.32s)]
*  He was flattered that someone was imitating him. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5380.32s)]

*  We gotta talk about your moms a little bit first before we catch the Patreon. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5512.92s)]
*  Just a tiny little bit. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5514.92s)]
*  First of all, the text that all... [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5516.92s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5518.92s)]
*  What? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5520.92s)]
*  What's he wearing? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5522.92s)]
*  I'm just saying that [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5524.92s)]
*  the size text that I got [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5526.92s)]
*  from your guys' moms [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5528.92s)]
*  Why did my mom text you? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5531.84s)]
*  Why did she text you? You're not a mom. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5533.84s)]
*  I know, but she just felt [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5535.84s)]
*  it necessary to text me [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5537.84s)]
*  and the way... [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5539.84s)]
*  The volume of the text. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5541.84s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5543.84s)]
*  The amount of text. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5545.84s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5547.84s)]
*  Did you throw it back? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5549.84s)]
*  How would I describe it? It was more of a feeling. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5551.84s)]
*  Than anything. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5553.84s)]
*  It was more of a taste. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5555.84s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5558.76s)]
*  Miles, I didn't get no text from your mom. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5560.76s)]
*  That's on purpose. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5562.76s)]
*  I didn't get text from your mom. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5564.76s)]
*  I just see her at your MSG show though. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5566.76s)]
*  She had her thangs out. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5568.76s)]
*  We gotta hug in. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5570.76s)]
*  My mom... [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5572.76s)]
*  Son, my mom... [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5574.76s)]
*  You want to know some real shit, son? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5576.76s)]
*  My mom got raising canes after the MSG show and some shit. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5578.76s)]
*  Immediately to the hospital. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5580.76s)]
*  Son, I don't know what's in raising canes, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5583.68s)]
*  but that shit spiked her blood sugar or something. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5585.68s)]
*  She's diabetic as hell. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5587.68s)]
*  Son, she was in the hospital. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5589.68s)]
*  The gallbladder exploded or something like that. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5591.68s)]
*  Scottish women did not invent fried chicken. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5593.68s)]
*  I thought the Scots could hail fried chicken, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5595.68s)]
*  but not raising canes. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5597.68s)]
*  Not the canes. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5599.68s)]
*  Son, my mom's blood sugar went crazy. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5601.68s)]
*  She thought she had food poisoning. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5603.68s)]
*  She went to the urgent care. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5605.68s)]
*  They were like, bitch, get your ass to the hospital. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5607.68s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5609.68s)]
*  Get your ass to the hospital. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5612.6s)]
*  Your gallbladder is almost destroyed. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5614.6s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5616.6s)]
*  Didn't even tell me for two days. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5618.6s)]
*  I land in LA, Greg's like, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5620.6s)]
*  hey, mom's been in the hospital. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5622.6s)]

*  They're just going to take my gallbladder out. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5630.6s)]
*  And what was it? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYxg80dmc7M&t=5632.6s)]
