*  What's up everybody and welcome to Flaygon, we're back, okay? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen, we went to Australia and, you know, Diddy was a pillar of the community. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3.36s)]
*  He had just given his masters back to all of his artists. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=11.16s)]
*  I mean, he was in a beautiful, loving relationship. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=11.66s)]
*  Alex Starry is starting to sweat and adjust his seat. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=13.76s)]
*  He doesn't know how to handle this topic. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=16.16s)]
*  Nah, we got to. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=17.84s)]

*  You know, I'm trying to get Diddy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=108.32s)]
*  But... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=110.32s)]
*  Do you think this was Diddy pretended to be gay so we wouldn't know about this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=111.32s)]
*  Like, tended? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=116.32s)]
*  Son, for all those years, the gay rumor was hovering, so we never had the grape rumor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=117.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=123.32s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=124.32s)]
*  All we heard about was the gay rumor, and gay is like root beer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=125.32s)]
*  Like, once you throw gay on it, we can't think of anything else. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=127.32s)]
*  We can't taste anything else. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=129.32s)]

*  Now this gets thrown out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=133.32s)]
*  Obviously the streets respect it a little more. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=135.32s)]

*  That's what he means. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=146.32s)]

*  The streets respect it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=150.32s)]
*  I thought the streets was like, yo, Diddy back! [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=151.32s)]
*  We ain't going nowhere. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=154.32s)]
*  We ain't going nowhere. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=157.32s)]

*  The bulls. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=796.26s)]
*  Race wasn't mentioned in the allegations. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=797.86s)]

*  Diddy is payin', which is, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=812.98s)]
*  it kinda makes you feel like [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=815.94s)]
*  maybe not all of the allegations are true, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=819.14s)]
*  but enough are true, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=821.34s)]
*  where this is easier to sweep under the rug. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=823.3399999999999s)]
*  But the problem with payin' is other people [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=826.42s)]
*  start to look back at their history with you, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=828.14s)]
*  and they go, you know what, maybe I was a little bit [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=830.02s)]
*  more drunk than I shoulda been when we had sex, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=832.54s)]
*  or we did a freak off. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=835.3s)]
*  My friend did a music video, he was a PA, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=836.3s)]
*  good friend of mine, and he did a Diddy video, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=839.02s)]
*  this was 2007 or somethin'. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=840.74s)]
*  And he said Diddy had his people listening on the intercom [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  to see if anybody on the crew [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=845.3399999999999s)]
*  was saying negative things about him. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=846.74s)]
*  And then also, he was so paranoid, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=848.42s)]
*  he would buy his own bag of ice for his drinks. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=850.78s)]
*  And I was like, that's crazy, maybe because you're so rich. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=854.02s)]
*  And then he, at the time, the video was such a nightmare, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=856.1800000000001s)]
*  he was kind of jaded, but he was like, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  I think also that speaks to, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=859.98s)]
*  you've done enough bad things to people [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=861.0600000000001s)]

*  And you're like, bro, I don't even trust anybody. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=863.9s)]
*  I might need my own ice fresh out the bag. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=865.7s)]
*  I don't want my drink touching anybody, this is mine. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=868.66s)]
*  He's a paranoid guy, and I think there might be a reason, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=871.82s)]
*  and there might be a lot of people that are comic. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=874.02s)]

*  Why were you suffering? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1244.2s)]
*  I was in my goddamn fucking seat, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1246.2s)]
*  laid back with your wife reading a fucking book. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1248.2s)]
*  You're too lazy to go get the goddamn book and start it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1250.2s)]
*  So you're just scrolling up and down fucking Instagram, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1252.2s)]

*  Yeah, okay. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1262.2s)]
*  But my brain doesn't work that way. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1264.2s)]
*  I need constant stimulus for this thing. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1266.2s)]
*  So the idea that I'm just sitting [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1268.2s)]
*  in this incredibly enjoyable place [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1270.2s)]

*  going fucking crazy [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1280.2s)]
*  and trying to hold it all together. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1282.2s)]
*  And I can't bitch about it because then I get the very normal [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1284.2s)]
*  reaction that you just gave me. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1286.2s)]
*  But that is my worst nightmare. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1288.2s)]
*  Just jump in the water. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1290.2s)]
*  I tried that. That's your worst nightmare? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1292.2s)]
*  That is my worst nightmare. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1294.2s)]
*  It was peak misery. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1296.2s)]
*  I found a place to play paddle 30 minutes away [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1298.2s)]
*  and I would take an Uber every single morning out there [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1300.2s)]
*  and back. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1302.2s)]
*  Because I was so absolutely [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1304.2s)]
*  bored out of my fucking mind. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1306.2s)]

*  the best for that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1330.2s)]
*  People should go there and they should enjoy it if you can do that. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1332.2s)]
*  I know this about myself now. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1334.2s)]

*  You should have gone on a history tour. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1388.2s)]
*  I love that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1390.2s)]

*  And yeah, we didn't do anything for the rest of the day. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1544.2s)]
*  My brain was already... [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1546.2s)]

*  What did you interpret? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1596.2s)]
*  That seems like a negative. That seems like a pejorative. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1598.2s)]
*  No. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1600.2s)]

*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1618.2s)]
*  As a culture, architecture... [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1620.2s)]
*  Fire. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1622.2s)]
*  The only other ancient architecture that you can put up against it is really Egypt. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1624.2s)]
*  Egypt. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1628.2s)]

*  Well, they're much more ancient. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1632.2s)]
*  A little pantheon or whatever. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1634.2s)]

*  Say what? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1644.2s)]

*  Mega-scans are great. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1660.2s)]
*  I don't think that we are grateful enough. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1662.2s)]
*  Right next door, the greatest people that have ever existed. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1666.2s)]
*  There is no better country to have an immigration crisis with. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1670.2s)]
*  The idea that it's called... [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1674.2s)]

*  We could have boat fulls of... [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1678.2s)]
*  Storming arcades. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1680.2s)]
*  Listen, we should start getting this down. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1684.2s)]
*  Keep it all in but bleep it. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1688.2s)]

*  Well, first time I don't say that. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1818.2s)]
*  I take their word for it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1820.2s)]

*  Lukewarm mud. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1828.2s)]
*  I had to pull Akash's cock out of it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1830.2s)]
*  Made the coffee taste better though. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1832.2s)]
*  You wanted cream. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1834.2s)]

*  And then literally he's going through how to make coffee. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1838.2s)]
*  When you guys are making it, first off, who makes it? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1840.2s)]
*  And they're like, well, our barista. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1842.2s)]
*  Okay, bring him out here. Barista comes out. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1844.2s)]
*  When you're making iced coffee, are you [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1846.2s)]
*  making coffee and then chilling it and then putting it [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1848.2s)]
*  into ice? Or are you making [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1850.2s)]
*  hot coffee and pouring hot coffee into ice? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1852.2s)]
*  Explain that. And then they would explain [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1854.2s)]
*  what it was. And then depending on the answer, he would go... [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1856.2s)]
*  We just take the whole coffee, we put [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1858.2s)]
*  it over the ice. Okay. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1860.2s)]
*  And then I go, well, what happens to the ice then? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1862.2s)]
*  Well, it melts. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1864.2s)]
*  Well, what is it now? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1866.2s)]
*  Is that an iced coffee? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1868.2s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1870.2s)]
*  To water it down. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1872.2s)]
*  Am I wrong to be upset about that? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1874.2s)]
*  Yes, it's first world problems and... [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1876.2s)]

*  But am I wrong to be upset about that or not? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1880.2s)]
*  Why are we the only [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1882.2s)]
*  culture that can wrap our heads around it? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1884.2s)]
*  Us and who? Mexicans. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1886.2s)]
*  Mexicans are the greatest. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1888.2s)]
*  And the best cooks. They take all the world's food [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1890.2s)]
*  and then they make it as good. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1892.2s)]
*  You walk into any restaurant as a Mexican cook, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1894.2s)]
*  you don't even question it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1896.2s)]

*  Make him sushi. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1904.2s)]
*  Make him whatever. You don't question it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1906.2s)]
*  Anywhere else you'd be a little concerned. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1908.2s)]
*  Let's just call it what it is. You walk into [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1910.2s)]
*  a sushi restaurant, you see a black [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1912.2s)]
*  dude with dreads. You eating that [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1914.2s)]

*  I'm a little curious. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1918.2s)]
*  Talk to me. Maybe jerk sushi [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1920.2s)]
*  or some shit like that. That shit might be fire. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1922.2s)]
*  It might hit. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1924.2s)]
*  Before you start going... This is an anime [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1926.2s)]
*  black. It might be an anime black. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1928.2s)]
*  Anime black is interesting. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1930.2s)]
*  Black is the wrong example because it's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1932.2s)]
*  so far from [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1934.2s)]
*  sushi that he [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1936.2s)]
*  might have had this obsession [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1938.2s)]
*  with sushi and then [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1940.2s)]
*  perfected the craft to do it. So I hear [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1942.2s)]
*  it's an anime black. We're good. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1944.2s)]
*  What if it's an Alex Media Black? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1946.2s)]

*  You can't do it. That's tough. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1956.2s)]
*  I assume sushi chefs went to a lot of training [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1958.2s)]
*  that it really learns back. If you're Mexican, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1960.2s)]
*  I'm like, I don't need training. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1962.2s)]
*  They don't need it. They're born with training. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1964.2s)]
*  It's just anime. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1966.2s)]
*  There's no hint of yellow. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1968.2s)]
*  It's bad sushi. Can I ask you a question? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=1970.2s)]

*  I'm a casual but it's an easy sport to follow even as a casual [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2499.48s)]
*  There's a little things I don't know like what like off-leg means or whatever the fuck [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2502.64s)]
*  I don't know what that means [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2507.04s)]
*  But you can keep up with the basics of who's winning and but but meaning like for example soccer at a distance is still very [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2507.72s)]
*  enjoyable. Yes [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2512.96s)]
*  like even when you play the video game of soccer, you're kind of like far yeah, whereas a [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2514.3599999999997s)]
*  Like football far away sucks kind of sucks. Yeah, this is a round stadium [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2519.24s)]
*  And it's I sure was saying it's built in a certain way with seats [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2523.58s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily matter how high you are because you still get a different vantage point on what's going on and you're fine [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2526.7s)]
*  Okay, so there's not really bad seats got it [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2531.74s)]

*  But then I looked at the seats that I would have gotten originally and those that I gave away those are good, too [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2536.9s)]

*  So every seat is good and I cannot explain the emotional stakes that if India won [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2544.18s)]
*  It would have been the greatest one of the greatest experiences of my life [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=2548.82s)]

*  No [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3846.22s)]
*  Wait, what why would that make a difference? The birds don't like to fraternize in the middle of the street. Yes, they do [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3847.42s)]
*  Oh [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3853.98s)]

*  The food is on the sidewalk now [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3874.92s)]
*  We got bike lanes [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3877.68s)]
*  So even if you're a little bit off the sidewalk trying to get whatever kernels of muffins or whatever fell off of someone's plate [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3878.66s)]
*  Now you got the bikes you see the bikes coming from a mile away [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3884.5s)]
*  You get out of the way back in the day used to be C car splat the bike lane saved the birds [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3887.8199999999997s)]

*  Nowadays we got all these e-bikes going like 40 50 miles per hour same speed as cards now, but your entire [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3899.7799999999997s)]

*  I do know the birds are getting hit by the front of the car and then they get smushed cuz they're maimed on the street [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=3947.8399999999997s)]

*  If you look at the fastest motherfucking marathon or he's basically sprinting a marathon [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4119.3s)]
*  But if the effort is jogging effort for them, they might call jogging to us [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4123.2s)]
*  It's full sprints your fastest speed is what they're running a marathon at. Yeah, they're running I think under six minute miles, right? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4127.08s)]
*  It's crazy. That's running 10 on the fucking treadmill. Yeah, that's a run [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4134.24s)]
*  So you don't think that person can sprint you think that's the fastest he's capable of going [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4137.64s)]
*  He might be able to sprint [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4143.400000000001s)]
*  But to us it's still but again to a bird to a bird dog [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4146.4s)]
*  Here where you going with this now you guys no, no, I'm gonna let y'all cook right now [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4150.82s)]
*  Before I [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4159.94s)]
*  Just want to point this out. I've always looked at flying as this envious thing [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4161.94s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, I wish I could do that because I assume that there is no [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4166.7s)]
*  Caloric usage at all. It is just pure [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4170.5s)]
*  It is like a net neutral Superman Superman flies and it doesn't cost higher he's not sweat and he's not nothing these birds are out there [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4173.360000000001s)]
*  Pushing especially if it's windy it might be an exhausting [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4181.360000000001s)]
*  laborious process that we assume is lovely and easy [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4185.04s)]
*  I would think the soaring would be more tiring because like inertia right the first part is the hardest part [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4188.72s)]
*  I thought and once you get going it's not as hard sure when they just like glad exactly soaring is you're using the wind [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4194.04s)]
*  You're talking about flapping [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4200.3s)]
*  Flaping is using the wind that's the dog soaring was like climbing [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4203.22s)]
*  Like you're going from the ground up to the sky that is a scent [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4206.820000000001s)]
*  Stop that's wrong [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4210.780000000001s)]
*  Cuz you're doing it again [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4216.1s)]
*  We just explained it and then you just said the same [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4218.22s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna explain the exact same way again do it again because I didn't get it first. It's something soaring, bro [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4220.900000000001s)]
*  You're not gonna be like, you know, who's soaring like oh my god [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4226.3s)]
*  No, you're soaring you're fucking [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4229.36s)]
*  Gliding if you will [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4232.719999999999s)]
*  You're on our side we were all [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4238.28s)]
*  Yeah, but now we got caught up on the some how this turned on me and I didn't [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4240.48s)]
*  Somebody [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4245.679999999999s)]
*  There's no victimless humor. Yeah [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4247.24s)]
*  No, I do think soaring is standing and I think flapping is jogging and then double flapping like Alex did before that's running [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4249.28s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. All right [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4255.28s)]
*  So we all want to have that ability but we don't want to be jogging all the fucking time [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4256.88s)]
*  We don't be running all the fucking time. What if throughout our day we just had to immediately jog or run constantly [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4260.599999999999s)]
*  Annoying. Yeah, and if you stop jogging you die, you're dead. That's great. Yeah. Yeah, what are you over the ocean? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4267.04s)]
*  Do they even go over the ocean like that? They mostly [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4273.36s)]
*  That's what we like to believe [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4278.88s)]
*  Gotta be walking it gotta be miles just said albatrosses can stay in the air for days. Sometimes they sleep. Yeah gotta be walking [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4281.88s)]
*  There's no way it's all it's all it's all like my gliding miles. They're so high up. I swear to God [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4288.06s)]
*  They're so high up. So let this be [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4294.06s)]
*  Your theory was wrong yo [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4297.66s)]
*  Doesn't make it right enough [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4300.86s)]
*  I need the buses the doctor you I'm right. I need the doctor [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4302.86s)]
*  Eleven foot weight man, they're like miles up in the air. There's no wind resistance up there. Yeah stupid [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4308.12s)]
*  Fuck do they get turbulence? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4313.52s)]
*  Son, did y'all have that turn? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4315.24s)]
*  And I accidentally fucked up cuz I split up seats with my girl and so she was just in the back texting me like why [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4319.8s)]
*  Did that again? I got upgraded to comfort plus Brian in the legroom. Yo, you [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4325.64s)]

*  I need it you should get upgraded but still give it to your girl [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4334.0199999999995s)]
*  She's small. Everything's comfort plus for her coming from the person who flew to Vegas and I ain't give it to my [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4339.139999999999s)]
*  Give it to your girl. No, if it's a lay flat, I'll give it to her. I did that when we see that's [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4344.78s)]
*  Absolute good. Okay, I got upgraded lay flat coming back from Athens. She got it the whole flight [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4353.86s)]
*  I had a window seat in the back and then I get one comfort plus [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4357.94s)]
*  I can't have it with the turbulence our last flight ever [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4361.22s)]
*  Because you get the points for comfort plus is not that big of a difference [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4367.16s)]
*  It's not about the point you get the point you're like, hey, just pay for the upgrade for to be comfort [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4371.0s)]
*  Chair in the sky don't be happy bro. Yo holler is deep beforehand and be like, you'll get us both in the same thing [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4379.52s)]

*  You know, you don't love your wife, you know, you can also I love her enough that she had a window seat [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4394.54s)]
*  Normally, she has to have a middle seat. Oh my god. Listen to Diddy over here [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4398.740000000001s)]

*  But now I was insane the turbulence is so bad that the flight attendants sat down on the aisle [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4449.1s)]
*  I've never seen that my life. We're in we're in there. I would have thought I was dying if that bro [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4452.46s)]
*  And then the fuck they got a seat the captain needs more bedside manner cuz we're flying and literally he's like [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4457.34s)]
*  Everyone take your seats immediately son. Our captain didn't say shit. Oh, we've done [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4462.54s)]
*  Yeah, better [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4466.88s)]
*  This is shit tell me any better if they don't say nothing cuz why they focus on flying [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4467.780000000001s)]
*  No, just don't scare anybody cuz they know everybody's gonna be I mean we I heard noises [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4471.34s)]

*  That was that was too windy with we got to try again [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4485.16s)]
*  Imagine hearing you imagine hearing take a seat immediately and the fucking flight attendant take [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4487.799999999999s)]
*  The captain's fault captain should have urgency this bitch wild breath [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4496.4s)]
*  Yeah, I've never seen him on [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=4500.46s)]

*  Let's take a look. We all want to know what is the age of consent in Oklahoma? This is all I had a guess 15 [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5034.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I'm a yeah. I was thinking early maybe 16 because I know in New York 17, which I think is weird [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5039.860000000001s)]
*  I was 16 years old. Okay, so this is my suspicion they come to him [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5047.58s)]
*  They go yo, what the fuck is going on and he goes I didn't know this that the other and they vet the actual age [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5052.22s)]
*  And then they go technically didn't do anything illegal he can play [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5058.3s)]
*  If they if he went to them and he has to be honest, right? There's a lot of shit riding on that [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5063.66s)]
*  There's gonna be like legal action. That's gonna reflect on the organization. They're gonna go [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5068.0199999999995s)]
*  They're gonna go uh, oh [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5073.46s)]

*  It is between 16 17 depending on the state [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5086.68s)]
*  So the Josh Gideon from Australia, okay [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5089.52s)]
*  So the assumption is does he believe it's okay and then do it [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5092.36s)]
*  Right and then the organization is like even though this is the creepiest fucking disgusting thing that you're out here [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5098.52s)]
*  Hooking up with high school girls [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5104.54s)]

*  I don't it doesn't add up to me that he's still playing at all [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5133.2s)]
*  That's the thing like the fact that he played the next thing made me think he didn't fuck [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5136.2s)]
*  Yes, he did. He's in a picture with her shirtless [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=5139.759999999999s)]

*  and it was a lot of fun [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6058.04s)]
*  and when we walked out, much to our surprise, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6058.879999999999s)]
*  there were paparazzi. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6061.24s)]
*  Alex walked in and out three times. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6062.879999999999s)]
*  You saw that? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6064.28s)]
*  Just so he could get his pick on. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6065.12s)]
*  I saw you change outfits. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6066.28s)]
*  The pit was fire. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6067.36s)]
*  He forgot something inside. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6068.2s)]
*  It was a hole in one side. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6069.04s)]
*  Hold on, you guys been here in two minutes? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6069.879999999999s)]
*  I had to get one with the jacket on, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6072.679999999999s)]
*  you know. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6074.32s)]
*  Yo. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6075.16s)]
*  Didn't show up on TMZ though. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6076.0s)]
*  Separate note. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6078.16s)]
*  Speaking of paparazzi, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6080.32s)]
*  that's what inspired this thought. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6081.16s)]
*  Kanye's new song, is it me or no one cares? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6082.92s)]
*  Sheesh, I know he had a new song. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6087.64s)]
*  But I've been checking out. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6090.64s)]
*  I think it might be over musically for Kanye. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6091.4800000000005s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6093.12s)]
*  I think he still has an ability [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6093.96s)]
*  to garner interest through antics. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6095.6s)]
*  What do you always say? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6100.4400000000005s)]
*  They have like a gravitational pull. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6101.280000000001s)]
*  He still has the gravitational pull, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6102.68s)]
*  but musically, he used to be able to stop the planet. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6104.88s)]
*  And he has a new song with Dirk and, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6109.88s)]
*  was it Party Next Door? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6112.4400000000005s)]
*  Ty Dolla Sign. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6113.56s)]
*  Or Ty Dolla Sign. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6114.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6115.240000000001s)]
*  And nothing. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6116.06s)]
*  Like I don't hear anybody bumping it. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6117.92s)]
*  Now, we could make the argument, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6119.4400000000005s)]
*  the streaming organizations are trying to squash it [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6121.240000000001s)]
*  and it's not getting radio attention. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6124.96s)]
*  And it's not getting radio play, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6127.68s)]
*  but we don't listen to radio. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6129.88s)]
*  We're just us and our friends. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6131.120000000001s)]
*  People are not using the audio online for their memes. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6132.820000000001s)]
*  It's slow movement. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6137.080000000001s)]
*  One. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6139.52s)]
*  Two. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6140.360000000001s)]
*  How do you think the Arab world [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6141.18s)]
*  and the Middle East world feels about all of these [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6142.900000000001s)]
*  almost like canceled or like lampooned celebrities [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6149.160000000001s)]
*  running to them for, I don't know, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6152.84s)]
*  like nurturing and love once they can't get it over here. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6156.8s)]
*  Like who else? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6161.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, Tate immediately. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6162.400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6165.16s)]
*  So it's like, what happens? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6166.4800000000005s)]
*  You get canceled in America, you just go out there [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6167.4400000000005s)]
*  and then they're gonna give you some embrace [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6170.0s)]
*  because the celebrity still has some cachet there [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6172.84s)]
*  and maybe they're not as offended [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6175.0s)]
*  by the cancellations back home. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6176.360000000001s)]
*  But like, do you think there's any part of them [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6178.04s)]
*  that's like, yo, y'all just come in here [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6179.400000000001s)]
*  because y'all can't get it like that back home. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6181.16s)]
*  I think they're using them too. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6183.4s)]
*  Like, all right, this is cute for now [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6184.5199999999995s)]
*  and then we'll eventually move on to the next. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6185.88s)]
*  So it's mutual using. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6186.72s)]
*  I think that window will probably close. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6188.16s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6190.099999999999s)]
*  Like for Middle Eastern countries, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6190.94s)]
*  for embracing people [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6192.22s)]
*  because they're just gonna have so much clout [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6193.0599999999995s)]
*  that like, yo, we don't need to take on. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6194.04s)]
*  That's one thing, it's like y'all got the clout. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6194.88s)]
*  You had every boxing champion in history at the fight. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6196.32s)]
*  But they paid for every boxing champion to be there. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6200.4s)]
*  That's fair, but the money is no option today. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6202.76s)]
*  Like they've unlimited amounts. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6204.44s)]
*  So Saudi has unlimited amount of money. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6205.8s)]
*  It doesn't have to like entertain Kanye. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6206.84s)]
*  But it's like American celebrities in Europe. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6209.88s)]
*  Like older rap artists can still tour crazy in Europe [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6213.4800000000005s)]
*  because they don't see them that often. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6217.56s)]
*  So they get more excited. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6219.0s)]
*  So there's a novelty. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6221.08s)]
*  They're never there. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6221.92s)]
*  It's a novelty effect. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6222.74s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6223.58s)]
*  They're always gonna be able to get that pop. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6224.42s)]
*  All right. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6226.08s)]
*  But is there again, everyone coming through? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6226.92s)]
*  I think that window for who they embrace. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6227.74s)]
*  Once it just becomes a place that you go, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6229.16s)]
*  now you no longer need to rely on the people you can get, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6231.68s)]
*  which are like the canceled American or European celebrities. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6234.7s)]
*  I don't see it ever becoming. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6237.52s)]
*  I've ever seen the Middle East. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6238.88s)]
*  I just don't ever see it becoming a place [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6240.52s)]
*  that everyone just goes. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6242.1s)]
*  Bro, if you're in Europe, it's growing fast, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6244.6s)]
*  but it's still not like, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6247.12s)]
*  people are still gonna have some reserve [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6249.4400000000005s)]
*  where it's just like, ah, you know. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6251.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6253.92s)]
*  It's changing so fast. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6254.76s)]
*  In three years, it feels like it's changed so much. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6255.96s)]
*  Honestly, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6259.2s)]
*  now we're gonna get geopolitical. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6263.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6265.2s)]
*  I think this is the reason why the Arab nations [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6266.08s)]
*  have not applied any pressure, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6269.28s)]
*  or seemingly any pressure towards Israel [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6272.96s)]
*  in the conflict right now. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6275.48s)]
*  They will put out this forward-facing support [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6277.7s)]
*  for the Palestinian people, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6281.12s)]
*  but they ain't ready to bang. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6282.88s)]
*  And I think it's because they're like, listen, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6285.04s)]
*  we do not want terrorism in this region. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6287.48s)]
*  We want investment. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6289.9s)]
*  We want people coming here for vacations. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6291.28s)]
*  We don't want this area to be synonymous [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6293.48s)]
*  with danger, murder, and killing. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6295.32s)]
*  We want this shit settled. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6297.24s)]
*  So Israel, on the low, I think they're basically like, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6299.299999999999s)]
*  Israel, go in there, get fucking Hamas out of there, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6301.96s)]
*  handle all that shit right here [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6304.639999999999s)]
*  so this thing can be swash [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6306.36s)]
*  and everybody can kind of pour in with the dollars. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6308.44s)]
*  Because I think they tasted it. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6310.4s)]
*  They tasted what it's like when you're the belle of the ball. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6311.84s)]
*  And in Europe, people are going down to the Emirates. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6314.24s)]
*  They're going down. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6317.08s)]
*  Now Saudi, with these fucking events, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6317.92s)]
*  is looking incredible. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6319.44s)]
*  There's all these new fights that are already scheduled. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6321.54s)]

*  Listen, we can't be thought of [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6325.0s)]
*  as this disgusting terror area of the world. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6326.8s)]
*  And that will happen if there's ongoing conflict. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6330.66s)]
*  Handle it. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6333.280000000001s)]
*  And if they backed Palestine, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6334.12s)]
*  this is gonna go on forever. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6337.320000000001s)]
*  So I think they're basically going, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6340.16s)]
*  hey, how quickly can we knock this shit out [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6342.12s)]
*  because we wanna get back to business as usual? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6346.0s)]
*  We gotta get Steve Harvey over here immediately. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6347.16s)]
*  Steve Harvey loves that. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6349.4800000000005s)]
*  There we go. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6350.320000000001s)]
*  And if it's good enough for Steve Harvey, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6351.320000000001s)]
*  it's good enough for me. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6352.4400000000005s)]
*  And you know who doesn't care about that? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6353.32s)]
*  Iran. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6356.2s)]
*  And you know who's not going to Iran? [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6357.139999999999s)]
*  Americans ain't going to Iran. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6358.8s)]
*  I don't know how many Europeans are going to Iran. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6360.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6361.92s)]
*  But they're the ones who don't benefit from that tourism, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6362.759999999999s)]
*  don't benefit from the Western dollars. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6365.8s)]
*  Not even just Western dollars, shit, Eastern dollars. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6367.48s)]
*  Everybody going there for vacation, et cetera. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6369.599999999999s)]
*  They have no benefit. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6371.32s)]
*  So they're like, oh yeah, let's fuck this up. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6372.16s)]
*  Y'all against us? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6373.5599999999995s)]
*  Let's keep fucking it up. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6374.48s)]
*  Maybe even Russia comes in as well. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6376.7s)]
*  But the other countries there who have tasted [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6379.24s)]
*  the limelight, tasted the enjoyment, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6381.92s)]
*  tasted that capitalism. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6384.2s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6385.8s)]
*  I think they're like, hey, shut this down [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6386.72s)]
*  as quick as possible. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6388.52s)]
*  Let's get back to business as usual. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6389.76s)]
*  I think long term they see the ability, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6392.32s)]
*  the potential to become a superpower. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6394.38s)]
*  On a global stage, we're a force, we got the money. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6396.24s)]
*  We got people that'll do it. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6399.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6401.68s)]
*  I don't know if they have the numbers to be superpower, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6402.52s)]
*  but I think that they could be an economic destination [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6403.92s)]
*  and a cultural destination. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6406.64s)]
*  In a place, in a hub for entertainment, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6408.56s)]
*  vacation, business, and culture. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6411.280000000001s)]
*  And it's like, that can't happen [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6414.240000000001s)]
*  if people are scared to come here [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6415.8s)]
*  because they're worried that they're gonna get [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6417.4400000000005s)]
*  a fucking bomb explode in a mailbox [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6419.84s)]
*  and they're gonna die, or they're worried [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6422.120000000001s)]
*  that somebody's gonna chuck a rock at their wife [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6424.0s)]
*  for walking around in a skirt. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6425.6s)]
*  So we need to make this shit feel very cool, calm, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6427.400000000001s)]
*  and enjoyable for the West [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6430.72s)]
*  because they tasted the dollars of the West. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6434.320000000001s)]
*  Question, have they run out of oil [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6436.0s)]
*  or they're running out of oil? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6439.48s)]
*  Depends on whom. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6441.36s)]
*  If we're talking about Saudi Arabia. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6442.72s)]
*  No, they have oil for. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6445.48s)]
*  What, if we're talking about Abu Dhabi? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6446.92s)]
*  Abu Dhabi still has oil, and natural gas, I believe. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6448.68s)]
*  Are they running out of oil? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6451.84s)]
*  Dubai has none left. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6453.12s)]
*  Ah, Dubai. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6454.48s)]
*  Dubai is the best in tourism. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6455.32s)]
*  So how long can they keep overpaying before they run out? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6457.24s)]
*  I think some countries, I heard this about Qatar. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6462.36s)]
*  They understood that their oil was drying up, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6464.12s)]
*  so they have some firm or hedge fund or whatever. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6466.36s)]
*  Take the money we're making now and start investing it. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6469.6s)]
*  They invested in a ton of, apparently they own [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6471.5199999999995s)]
*  a crazy amount of the skyscrapers in London [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6473.48s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6475.76s)]
*  So they are, we're running out of oil money, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6476.76s)]
*  but we're not running out of money money. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6479.5599999999995s)]
*  They're devoid of oil. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6480.84s)]
*  We're running out of oil, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6481.68s)]
*  but our money's been invested into other things. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6482.5199999999995s)]
*  Like don't they own, who owns Qatar? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6484.5199999999995s)]
*  PSG. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6487.8s)]
*  Yeah, Paris Intermade. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6488.64s)]
*  They've invested in these incredibly lucrative businesses, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6490.04s)]
*  so they're still generating wealth and revenue. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6492.2s)]
*  But another part of that would be creating [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6494.5199999999995s)]
*  a tourism destination. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6496.4s)]
*  And it's been quite effective, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6498.08s)]
*  and that's the idea of sports washing [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6499.72s)]
*  or whatever the fuck you wanna do. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6501.8s)]
*  I'm just wondering how long can they keep overpaying? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6502.639999999999s)]
*  Because sports washing is overpaying, it's overpaying. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6505.04s)]
*  They're not making that money back. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6507.88s)]
*  They're just trying to. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6509.0s)]
*  It's PR move. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6510.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big PR move. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6511.04s)]
*  So it's like how long can they sustain that [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6512.44s)]
*  before people like. Define overpaying. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6516.0s)]
*  This is a tricky thing here, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6518.74s)]
*  because if the state owns the operation, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6520.2s)]
*  they don't care about profiting on it. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6523.36s)]
*  They don't need to, because they're not. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6526.639999999999s)]
*  Bob Arum or Don King has to profit, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6528.12s)]
*  because that's how they pay their bills, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6529.96s)]
*  that's how they pay their staff, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6530.96s)]
*  that's how they pay everything. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6532.0s)]
*  If they just break even on a fight, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6533.16s)]
*  that's just their, whatever it is. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6535.5199999999995s)]
*  Think about all the money that is coming in from hotels, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6537.24s)]
*  all the money that can come in for potential, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6540.38s)]
*  not only sponsorships, activities. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6542.32s)]
*  People have to eat while they're there. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6544.66s)]
*  They're gonna go. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6546.48s)]
*  I don't even think they're breaking even on this stuff. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6547.32s)]
*  No, but it's like a loss lead. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6548.16s)]
*  You know how Walmart would sell toys [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6549.52s)]
*  for less than what they paid for them? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6551.120000000001s)]
*  Because I know when you come to Walmart, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6552.4800000000005s)]
*  you're not just buying toys. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6553.64s)]
*  You're buying groceries. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6554.4800000000005s)]
*  We're making our money elsewhere. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6555.6s)]
*  So they have enough money to keep taking. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6556.76s)]
*  50 million for a fighter or whatever, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6559.240000000001s)]
*  we have trillions of dollars. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6560.96s)]
*  How about this? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6562.76s)]
*  Just saying how long can they keep doing that? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6563.6s)]
*  Because every place else can't do that. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6564.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think. Because they're. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6567.080000000001s)]
*  Well, because other places aren't invested in people [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6568.88s)]
*  looking at that as a possible tourist destination. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6571.320000000001s)]
*  So for example. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6574.02s)]
*  I mean, every place. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6574.860000000001s)]
*  Well, America don't need it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6575.96s)]
*  Like America, like for example, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6577.3s)]
*  America isn't investing in this fight. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6578.92s)]

*  because people are already gonna come to America. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6583.64s)]

*  So according to this Google search, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6590.120000000001s)]

*  there will be 299 years of oil left. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6597.84s)]

*  How much does Tesla pay in advertising and commercials? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6630.46s)]
*  Zero. Elon is their advertiser. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6636.46s)]
*  Maybe Saudi isn't putting out [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6640.02s)]
*  some crazy promotional campaign of come to Saudi Arabia [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6642.06s)]

*  all this other shit. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6652.1s)]
*  And maybe they've gone, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6653.06s)]
*  all right, instead of spending $50 million that way, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6654.18s)]
*  why don't we just spend $50 million on the biggest fight? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6656.56s)]
*  We'll pay double, but we'll have all the eyeballs [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6659.62s)]
*  on what Saudi Arabia is. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6663.1s)]

*  and see what's going on. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6669.38s)]

*  they might be paying the same amount [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6674.240000000001s)]
*  than they would pay to advertise [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6676.740000000001s)]
*  in a more traditional manner [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6678.54s)]
*  for people to come to their country. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6679.6s)]

*  Shit, if you don't think they paid [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6698.1s)]
*  single old bitches in New York show, what's that called? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6702.38s)]
*  Sex and the City to do the second movie in, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6705.38s)]
*  where did they go for it? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6708.62s)]
*  They went to one Middle Eastern country [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6710.1s)]
*  for the second movie. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6711.66s)]
*  No, they paid crazy. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6712.5s)]
*  That's point-to-watching shit works. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6714.38s)]
*  You don't think that they paid them shit? [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6715.22s)]
*  Hey, they said, hey, make the whole thing about here. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6716.26s)]
*  Here's a check, pay them whatever the fuck you want. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6718.7s)]
*  We don't give a fuck. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6721.22s)]
*  And then you have the foremost influential old white bitches [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6722.06s)]
*  that influence all the other old white bitches [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6725.820000000001s)]
*  and younger white bitches. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6728.3s)]
*  Now they're gonna go out there. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6730.22s)]
*  I just feel like it takes a long time to undo [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6732.820000000001s)]
*  all of the negative press America has put on that region. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6736.780000000001s)]
*  I think tenure is max before, you know what, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6745.34s)]
*  it looks kinda lit though. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6747.5s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6748.900000000001s)]
*  No, I think that's a good point. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6749.740000000001s)]
*  How much money do they have to spend [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6751.22s)]
*  to convince us it's okay? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6752.46s)]
*  For example, when Taco Bell has autumn rats eating the tacos [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6753.9800000000005s)]
*  while the place is closed, you take a week off Taco Bell, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6758.06s)]
*  you're like, ew, what the fuck is going on with Taco Bell? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6760.7s)]
*  But then they put out the new Gordita Crunch [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6763.18s)]
*  and you're like, rats don't fuck with that. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6764.820000000001s)]
*  So they have to, again, basically dig themselves [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6767.820000000001s)]
*  out of that hole. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6771.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm just wondering which one comes first. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6773.5s)]
*  They're going for it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6775.740000000001s)]
*  Convince the people or they get it. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6776.58s)]
*  I think they have way more money [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6778.22s)]
*  than time is gonna take. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6779.38s)]
*  I think. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6780.9s)]
*  I think we're already kinda looking at it. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6782.74s)]
*  We're not fully being like, that looks lit, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6785.139999999999s)]
*  but we're like, eh. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6786.98s)]
*  I think the tricky thing happens when. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6787.9s)]
*  It looks interesting. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6789.259999999999s)]
*  This is what I think the tricky thing happens. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6790.54s)]
*  When the places that have built up these tourist destinations [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6792.839999999999s)]
*  that haven't wrapped the tourism around culture, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6796.719999999999s)]
*  they've just wrapped it around, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6802.46s)]
*  hey, look at this crazy building [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6804.139999999999s)]
*  or look at this fucking arcade or look whatever. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6805.58s)]
*  Those can't offer anything [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6809.3s)]
*  when a newer, fancier tourist destination comes out. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6811.22s)]
*  Italy's not going anywhere. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6815.2s)]
*  Greece is not going anywhere. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6816.34s)]
*  Mexico's not going anywhere [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6817.46s)]
*  because they offer thousands of years [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6819.06s)]
*  of history and culture. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6821.3s)]
*  So if Saudi is smart, they'll look at the mistakes [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6823.12s)]
*  that have been made and the successes [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6827.02s)]
*  that have been made in the region and go, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6828.860000000001s)]
*  okay, this is what we have to avoid [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6830.88s)]
*  and this is what we have to lean into. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6832.84s)]
*  If I'm Saudi, or if I'm any of them, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6834.7s)]
*  I'm wrapping it around culture. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6838.7s)]
*  Everything has to be culture, culture, culture. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6840.139999999999s)]
*  Do that a little bit. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6842.98s)]
*  But keep this good, good. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6843.82s)]
*  You have a good point. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6844.82s)]
*  They do it with the, hey, you can dress up, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6845.66s)]
*  wear the headscarf, take your pictures, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6848.0199999999995s)]
*  be on a fucking camel and shit like that, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6849.78s)]
*  but at the same time, it's like, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6851.54s)]
*  hey, women can't do this or you can't do that [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6852.58s)]
*  or you're oppressed in this way. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6854.7s)]
*  It's like, it's hard to really wrap it around the culture. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6855.94s)]
*  You gotta get people addicted to the commerce. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6858.179999999999s)]
*  And once they've become accustomed to their new life, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6861.84s)]
*  they do not wanna sacrifice it. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6865.0599999999995s)]
*  And then once they don't wanna sacrifice it, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6867.06s)]
*  they're willing to make the changes [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6869.26s)]
*  to continue this new life. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6871.9800000000005s)]
*  And that is the game. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6875.580000000001s)]
*  So the first thing is get people addicted to the money [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6877.02s)]
*  and the success and driving the nice cars [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6879.900000000001s)]
*  and eating at the fanciest restaurants [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6881.9800000000005s)]
*  and all your favorite athletes coming over. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6883.580000000001s)]
*  And then if they feel that dip even a little bit, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6886.22s)]
*  you go, well, people don't wanna come here [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6891.68s)]
*  because women can't drive. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6893.46s)]
*  They feel a little bit. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6894.56s)]
*  Well, let these bitches drive. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6895.719999999999s)]
*  Don't affect my money, let them drive. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6897.799999999999s)]
*  I don't care if they drive. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6899.48s)]
*  There's also maybe elements of the culture [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6900.32s)]
*  we don't even know about. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6901.139999999999s)]
*  Like what if they told you, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6901.98s)]
*  like hey, we have pyramids of Saudi Arabia. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6902.82s)]
*  You'd be like, I have no idea. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6904.36s)]
*  I have no idea what's over there, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6906.5599999999995s)]
*  but this is like an ancient country [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6907.639999999999s)]
*  that has generations of culture [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6909.08s)]
*  that we might not know about [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6911.28s)]
*  because they haven't pushed the cultural elements. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6912.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6914.32s)]
*  Like, obviously, it's tragic, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6915.16s)]
*  obviously, what has happened to Iraq [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6917.5599999999995s)]
*  and we're responsible for that as America, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6919.04s)]
*  but there is so much history in Iraq. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6923.56s)]
*  Like this is the birthplace of civilization. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6926.56s)]
*  Like imagine you could wrap that into the tourism, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6929.240000000001s)]
*  like going to see these fucking ancient relics, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6932.4800000000005s)]
*  the ones that are still there. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6935.080000000001s)]
*  Like you're like, holy shit, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6936.200000000001s)]
*  you're doing Rome again, you're doing Greece again. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6937.68s)]
*  It's in the Middle East. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6940.160000000001s)]
*  Like to me, that's exciting. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6941.0s)]
*  Like, all right, let's go. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6942.200000000001s)]
*  I wanna see it. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6943.72s)]
*  And wrap everything around it. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6944.84s)]
*  You can do the fancy new technological stuff. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6946.080000000001s)]
*  Just give me a little feeling of the old stuff. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6948.46s)]
*  You know, and. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6951.96s)]
*  Yeah, that was my only issue with Dubai. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6953.76s)]
*  It just felt like consumerism for consumerism's sake. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6955.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're the first ones. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6958.5599999999995s)]
*  So they're like, okay, how do we do this? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6959.96s)]
*  And that, I feel, doesn't last. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6961.5599999999995s)]
*  It doesn't last when a new thing pops up. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6963.92s)]
*  And I think that's what Saudi is going. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6966.139999999999s)]
*  They're going, hey, the Emiratis and the Saudis are friends [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6968.28s)]
*  and everybody's cool and shit, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6971.0199999999995s)]
*  but the Saudis are still going, okay. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6972.0599999999995s)]
*  So they dumped a bunch of money into this [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6974.16s)]
*  and they made this technological hub [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6975.5199999999995s)]
*  and it's been amazing and successful [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6977.24s)]
*  and it's a tourism destination [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6978.96s)]
*  and people wanna see all this amazing fancy stuff. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6980.16s)]
*  But we can also do that. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6983.0s)]
*  How else can we change it? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6984.599999999999s)]
*  How else can we improve it? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6986.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think if I'm like, if I'm the Emirates [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6987.44s)]
*  or if I'm Saudi, I'm making a week of programming [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6989.5599999999995s)]
*  that you cannot miss if you're part of the jet setter crew. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=6997.24s)]
*  The jet setter crew often dictates culture. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7000.5199999999995s)]
*  Like in New York, for example, the end of summer, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7002.92s)]
*  it's Labor Day, people are in the Hamptons. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7006.2s)]
*  Immediately, there's the US Open, Labor Day, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7008.96s)]
*  and then New York Fashion Week [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7012.4s)]
*  all within like two and a half weeks. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7013.4800000000005s)]
*  If you're like a wealthy person, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7015.76s)]
*  you're parking yourself here for at least a week of that. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7017.86s)]
*  Now, if you're not one of those super rich people, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7022.16s)]
*  but you're one of us, you're like, oh dude, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7025.68s)]
*  I wanna go to some Fashion Week parties. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7027.82s)]
*  Or oh dude, what's going on for Labor? [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7029.64s)]
*  Oh, US Open? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7031.0s)]
*  It'd be sick to go check out US Open. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7031.84s)]
*  You might try to do one of those things. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7033.16s)]
*  How can you make one week of events? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7034.64s)]
*  So imagine there's UFC Fight, F1, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7038.2s)]
*  and then there might be some cultural [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7040.68s)]
*  or historical thing in the region. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7041.96s)]
*  You're like, oh, I can hit all this shit in two weeks. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7043.12s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying this is it, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7044.8s)]
*  but UFC Fight, Andrew Schultz show is a weekend. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7046.2s)]
*  Now, if I'm some guy in England, I go, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7051.04s)]
*  bro, I go to Dubai for the fucking weekend [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7052.94s)]
*  and I get to watch the UFC Fight in Abu Dhabi [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7055.0s)]
*  then Schultz in the next night. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7056.76s)]
*  What's a week of that? [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7058.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia Fashion Week, that's what they gotta do. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7060.0s)]
*  To wrap it up. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7062.44s)]
*  Wrap it up. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7063.28s)]
*  Run it up, dude. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7064.12s)]
*  But then that's what it's like. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7065.36s)]
*  Okay, here's an F1 race. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7066.84s)]
*  Then there's a UFC Fight. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7068.24s)]
*  Then there's another thing. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7069.56s)]
*  And now the four of us are sitting here going, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7070.76s)]
*  bro, don't you wanna watch Izzy fight? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7072.92s)]
*  Yo, Izzy's fighting. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7075.24s)]
*  And then we could also watch the F1. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7076.08s)]
*  Why don't we just go there for the week? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7077.44s)]
*  The girls can go shopping over here. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7079.08s)]
*  We just go. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7080.84s)]
*  They gotta get the girls, bro. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7081.68s)]
*  Well, that's the game. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7082.92s)]
*  Focusing on the guys, they gotta get the women. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7084.84s)]
*  The Russians got that on lock though. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7086.68s)]
*  So the women. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7087.8s)]
*  So they're fly, go, go. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7088.96s)]
*  I thought it was like, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7090.68s)]
*  I thought there were like freelance pros out there. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7091.6s)]
*  I thought they were just running their own thing. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7095.08s)]
*  Apparently it's like, this is told to me, allegedly. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7096.84s)]
*  Like Russian mafia. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7099.679999999999s)]
*  He is tip toe, man. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7101.84s)]
*  Russian mafia. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7103.0s)]
*  I don't wanna get killed by some Russians. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7103.84s)]
*  Come on, I can't do it. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7105.24s)]
*  I can't do it, it's scary. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7106.12s)]
*  But basically these Russian mafia people, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7107.48s)]
*  like oligarchs basically, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7109.719999999999s)]
*  are flying in private jets full of dimes. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7111.16s)]
*  And then they just drop them off free range. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7114.719999999999s)]
*  And then if you go chat with them, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7116.92s)]
*  they're like, oh yeah, let's meet up later. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7118.08s)]
*  Here's my number. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7119.679999999999s)]
*  And then you meet up. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7120.759999999999s)]
*  And then there's a guy there that's like, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7122.16s)]
*  here's what the deal is. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7123.5199999999995s)]
*  And you can either leave or you can stay, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7124.639999999999s)]
*  but you gotta pay the way. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7125.88s)]
*  I was saying, to get that shit going, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7126.719999999999s)]
*  you have to bring the attractions [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7128.679999999999s)]
*  and get the girls going. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7130.32s)]
*  Well that's the beauty of it. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7131.48s)]
*  I think girls drive, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7132.32s)]
*  like, oh the girls are gonna be there? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7134.48s)]
*  That's when the guys. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7137.04s)]
*  This is the beauty of fashion week. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7137.88s)]
*  The girls all wanna be at the fashion events. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7140.12s)]
*  And no girl's gonna turn down the opportunity [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7142.599999999999s)]
*  to even go to a thing. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7145.44s)]
*  And if you're a young hot chick, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7147.0s)]
*  you wanna be invented, invited to all the fashion events. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7148.48s)]
*  So if you build cultural tent poles around these events [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7152.16s)]
*  that women really wanna be at. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7156.5599999999995s)]
*  What are you chicks like? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7157.88s)]
*  That's the thing they haven't been doing. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7158.72s)]
*  What are girls like, bro? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7159.76s)]
*  They're like, Instagram pictures. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7160.92s)]
*  How can you do? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7162.92s)]
*  What's the shit in Miami that's about to happen? [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7163.84s)]
*  By a basil. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7165.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, art basil, oh God. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7166.44s)]
*  Things where you can take pictures. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7167.8s)]
*  But here's the thing that's tricky. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7169.32s)]
*  How exactly can you do a fashion show [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7171.2s)]
*  in a place that preaches modesty for the women? [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7173.2s)]
*  So if there's gonna be this fashion show [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7176.8s)]
*  where you're gonna have cleavage out. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7178.639999999999s)]
*  That's why I think that, I don't know how much I have. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7180.36s)]
*  You have to find another way. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7182.76s)]
*  What is another thing [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7183.88s)]
*  that these beautiful women wanna be at? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7184.92s)]
*  What are beautiful women like, dude? [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7186.44s)]
*  Ah, car shit. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7189.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7191.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7192.04s)]
*  Yeah, that'll do it. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7192.88s)]
*  That's what we need, bro. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7194.04s)]
*  That's why New York is popping right now. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7195.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7197.5199999999995s)]
*  At the Flagon Studios. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7198.36s)]
*  I walk out of home with this guy, so it is crazy. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7199.679999999999s)]
*  But what is it? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7202.8s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7203.639999999999s)]
*  How can they, I mean, F1, I think women like, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7204.48s)]
*  but I think they don't like the race. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7208.32s)]
*  They just like that it is a form of luxury. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7210.32s)]
*  It's like a yacht week or something like that. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7213.08s)]
*  And it's not women going. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7214.92s)]
*  It's the women on the arms of a guy who's going. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7215.759999999999s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7217.48s)]
*  Whereas fashion, it's like, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7218.48s)]
*  chicks will go if we going or not. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7219.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7221.4s)]
*  So what is the move? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7222.24s)]
*  What do girls like, money? [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7225.08s)]
*  Girls like money? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7226.16s)]
*  You do that? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7227.0s)]
*  I think you can tie it around fashion [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7228.2s)]
*  and dressing up like Kentucky Derby shit. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7230.32s)]
*  What's the Derby day or whatever [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7232.88s)]
*  where girls get to wear them fucking hats and all that. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7233.84s)]
*  That's, again, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7236.5199999999995s)]
*  that type of stuff. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7237.4s)]
*  That's conservative. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7238.639999999999s)]
*  The only problem is their conservative dressing for women [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7240.639999999999s)]
*  isn't as fashion forward. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7244.759999999999s)]
*  Look like a mummy. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7247.92s)]
*  It's all haram, bro. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7250.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7251.44s)]
*  Everything girls like is haram. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7252.28s)]
*  What's up with that? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7253.099999999999s)]
*  Yo, low key. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7253.94s)]
*  That's why they had to do it [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7255.32s)]
*  because they know what they like. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7256.639999999999s)]
*  And they got to stifle them desire, bro. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7258.799999999999s)]
*  It's haram, bro. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7261.0s)]
*  It wasn't always like that. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7261.839999999999s)]
*  Wasn't always like that. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7263.48s)]
*  Maybe falconing. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7265.0s)]
*  Why are they all like falcons out there? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7265.839999999999s)]
*  Did you notice that? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7267.88s)]
*  I like a falcon. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7268.72s)]
*  Queued back on the falcons? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7269.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I just saw the picture, bro. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7270.4s)]
*  Saudis be falconing, bro. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7271.72s)]
*  Actually out there, they like all animals. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7273.5599999999995s)]
*  Bro, you saw this? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7275.68s)]
*  Mother chartered a whole airplane [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7277.16s)]
*  and just lined it up with falcons. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7279.8s)]
*  They already can fly, bro. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7281.68s)]
*  80 of them. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7282.76s)]
*  They already fly. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7283.599999999999s)]
*  You don't even need to put them in a plane. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7284.44s)]
*  That's so funny. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7285.5199999999995s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7286.36s)]
*  That is a crazy. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7287.76s)]
*  Don't even fly, my boy. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7288.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7290.36s)]
*  We got you. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7291.2s)]
*  I got you. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7292.04s)]
*  Put them in coach though. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7292.86s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7293.7s)]
*  This is where I was sitting. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7294.54s)]
*  My girl was back here in the falcon seat. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7295.88s)]
*  Why do they like falcons so much? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7296.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7298.0s)]
*  I saw a falcon almost die this weekend, actually. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7298.84s)]
*  This is a true story. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7301.04s)]
*  I'm having evil times. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7302.4400000000005s)]
*  I think you're talking about Ludacris. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7306.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7307.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7308.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7309.12s)]
*  He did almost die. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7309.96s)]
*  Did Ludo almost die? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7311.8s)]
*  I got freaked out. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7312.72s)]
*  The eye is coming down from his shit. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7313.56s)]
*  He didn't look comfortable at all, bro. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7314.52s)]
*  You saw it? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7316.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be either. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7316.84s)]
*  That shit was crazy. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7317.68s)]
*  That was terrifying. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7318.52s)]
*  He was letting the audience sing a lot. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7319.34s)]
*  You notice that? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7320.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7321.02s)]
*  Hey. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7321.860000000001s)]
*  Move. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7322.68s)]
*  Move. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7323.52s)]
*  At a certain point, I feel like he was talking [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7324.360000000001s)]
*  to the operators. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7325.2s)]
*  Like, no, move. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7326.04s)]
*  I need to get down seriously. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7326.88s)]
*  Please help me out. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7327.7s)]
*  But no, no. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7328.54s)]
*  I was at Medieval Times and they had a falcon come out [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7329.38s)]
*  in the middle of the show and then the falcon flies [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7330.22s)]
*  around the whole thing and then it flew into a net. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7332.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, they still do that. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7334.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7335.4s)]
*  I do remember that. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7336.24s)]
*  I remember that part. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7337.08s)]
*  That shit was impressive. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7337.9s)]
*  But your falcon didn't fly directly into a net [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7338.74s)]
*  and get stuck for a couple minutes. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7340.5199999999995s)]
*  Nah. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7342.0s)]
*  Flew into the net, got stuck. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7342.84s)]
*  Right back to the doofus. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7343.679999999999s)]
*  And then everyone kind of stopped cheering [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7344.5199999999995s)]
*  and then it flew down and then they caught it [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7345.679999999999s)]
*  with the rope thing and then the falcon was just [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7347.36s)]
*  kind of on the ground for a little bit. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7348.96s)]
*  And that's what you loved about Medieval Times? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7350.639999999999s)]
*  Up here, we got it under control. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7355.24s)]
*  Nah, this falcon's first day. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7356.36s)]
*  He was struggling. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7358.08s)]
*  All the little nephews were like, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7358.92s)]
*  what's up with the bird? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7359.76s)]
*  And then immediately after they serve you a half chicken. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7361.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7363.24s)]
*  That is a little crazy. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7364.08s)]
*  This is the old falcon. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7364.92s)]
*  They switch to the chicken though. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7365.76s)]
*  Thank god. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7366.58s)]
*  With us, we used to have the big ass turkey leg [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7367.42s)]
*  or whatever the fuck it was. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7370.28s)]
*  I'm glad they went chicken. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7371.44s)]
*  Yeah, half chicken. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7372.72s)]
*  It was amazing, bro. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7373.5599999999995s)]
*  Honestly, I enjoyed it. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7374.4s)]
*  Still no seasoning. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7375.24s)]
*  No seasoning, but they didn't have seasoning [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7376.08s)]
*  in Medieval Times. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7376.92s)]
*  It's salty, bro. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7377.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7378.58s)]
*  No, you don't remember? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7379.42s)]
*  It was just no seasoning on the meat, on the meat part. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7380.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7383.76s)]
*  But it was just. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7385.96s)]
*  I'm talking about that tomato soup. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7387.36s)]
*  Oh, Dragon's Blood? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7389.4s)]
*  You're talking about Dragon's Blood? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7390.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they call it. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7391.0599999999995s)]
*  They didn't have tomatoes. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7393.28s)]
*  That's a New World thing, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7394.12s)]
*  but they did have Dragon's Blood back in Medieval Times. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7394.94s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7396.76s)]
*  Tomatoes came from here. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7397.6s)]
*  I like how they cut costs [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7398.42s)]
*  and just say that's how things were back then. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7399.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7401.12s)]
*  We could pay for spice, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7401.96s)]
*  or just say there was no spice back then. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7402.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7404.24s)]
*  No knives and forks. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7405.08s)]
*  But this is shit I don't understand. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7405.92s)]
*  They used to wrap meat in salt to preserve it [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7407.22s)]
*  and keep it for long distances and shit. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7410.2s)]
*  Use it in the seasoning when you cook it. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7412.48s)]
*  I think it was Middle Eastern, bro. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7415.240000000001s)]
*  See, they were on seasoning early. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7416.08s)]
*  No, like on long journeys. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7416.92s)]
*  They would just fucking cover the meat in salt. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7418.320000000001s)]
*  I don't think whites did that. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7420.360000000001s)]
*  I think whites did it. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7421.88s)]
*  I don't know, bro. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7422.72s)]
*  I don't know if whites were on the preservation. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7423.56s)]
*  I was on the right shit, yeah. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7425.320000000001s)]
*  Even the whites? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7426.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7427.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7428.240000000001s)]
*  Yo, Miles is on his shit today. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7429.06s)]
*  Y'all gotta give it up for Miles. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7432.12s)]
*  Let's give it up for Miles. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7433.360000000001s)]
*  All those Falcons have passports. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7434.88s)]
*  We're back. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7438.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7438.84s)]
*  Yeah, that is actually a little wild. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7439.68s)]
*  The UAE gives out Falcon passports. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7440.96s)]
*  What? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7443.92s)]

*  I like that. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7447.900000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7448.74s)]

*  They're at the gate? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7450.88s)]
*  There's enough bitches. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7451.88s)]
*  There's enough birds. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7453.04s)]
*  Are they going through customs? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7453.88s)]
*  Anything to declare? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7455.64s)]
*  Bro, that's crazy. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7457.08s)]
*  So that guy not only got 80 seats, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7458.28s)]

*  Yeah, you gotta respect it. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7466.0s)]
*  Anyway, we gotta go to Medieval Times. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7467.0s)]
*  That's all I understand. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7468.24s)]
*  It's crazy they respect Falcons more than women. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7469.08s)]
*  Ain't that crazy? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7470.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7471.12s)]

*  Not a knot? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7473.08s)]
*  No, these Falcons, they can't see. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7474.32s)]
*  Oh, that's a little, wow, they got the head cover. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7475.88s)]
*  No, they're still a little covered. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7478.12s)]
*  They got many talons. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7481.16s)]
*  They also don't have hair. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7482.44s)]
*  You gotta cover the hair. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7483.76s)]
*  Falcons got no hair, only feathers. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7484.74s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7487.26s)]
*  All right, what else we got? [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7488.44s)]
*  No feelings, no facts. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7489.28s)]
*  Let's do feelings, no facts, rifle through, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7490.12s)]
*  and then we out. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7491.92s)]
*  We can just rifle through, dude. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7492.74s)]
*  All right, so there's a protest going on [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7494.12s)]
*  on Ireland right now. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7496.24s)]
*  Did you see this? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7497.24s)]
*  What was that about? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7498.06s)]
*  Apparently, there was a dude that stabbed someone. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7499.44s)]
*  I don't really know what that is. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7501.8s)]
*  Was it an Algerian immigrant? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7503.200000000001s)]
*  It was an immigrant that went there to Ireland. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7504.04s)]
*  I don't know if he was legal, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7506.8s)]
*  if he came through, it was like refugee status, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7507.68s)]
*  but basically stabbed someone, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7509.200000000001s)]
*  and now people are pissed off [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7510.34s)]
*  that they're just letting people into the country [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7512.4400000000005s)]
*  that are doing violent acts. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7514.160000000001s)]
*  So what's the deal? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7516.08s)]
*  Protests bucking off. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7516.92s)]
*  People are going crazy. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7517.76s)]
*  McGregor is very outspoken and telling people his opinions. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7518.6s)]
*  He seems pretty diplomatic about it, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7522.200000000001s)]
*  but he's very much like, yo, let's lock it down. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7523.68s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7526.64s)]
*  You know what's funny is that there's been a series [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7529.280000000001s)]
*  of elections where the quote unquote [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7531.72s)]
*  like extreme right candidate has either won [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7537.0s)]
*  or has gotten close to winning. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7540.56s)]
*  Really close to winning. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7541.96s)]
*  So this seems to be like a trend. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7543.400000000001s)]
*  How much longer can you call that the extreme right? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7545.88s)]
*  As opposed to? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7549.320000000001s)]
*  What people want. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7551.16s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7554.4800000000005s)]
*  You have to have a different form of description [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7555.52s)]
*  if almost the majority or the majority starts to desire this. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7560.26s)]
*  Right, and I understand you're labeling in that way [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7566.14s)]
*  as a pejorative, right? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7568.38s)]
*  You're trying to like insult these people and their beliefs, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7569.5s)]
*  but if their beliefs reflect what the people want, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7572.0s)]
*  that is kind of public sentiment. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7575.42s)]
*  Yeah, but it's the left labeling it as extreme right. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7579.3s)]
*  It's not the right saying we are the extreme right. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7582.22s)]
*  I think that's a good point, but I think media in general, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7585.1s)]
*  and I don't wanna like label media in general as left, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7587.38s)]
*  even though sometimes it might lean that way, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7590.08s)]
*  but media in general tends to call it the extreme right, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7592.6s)]
*  which I don't know if it's the best term [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7597.28s)]
*  if it's becoming more popular, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7599.0s)]
*  and I think it's a way to like, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7600.48s)]
*  I don't know if this is their goal, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7602.28s)]
*  but they're kind of using it as a way [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7603.84s)]
*  to almost like discredit them or make them radioactive, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7609.6s)]
*  but by doing that, you're not listening [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7615.0199999999995s)]
*  to what the people are concerned about. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7617.92s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7620.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7620.84s)]
*  Like, whether or not they're right or wrong, [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7621.66s)]
*  there's still something that they're like bothered by [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7623.6s)]
*  that isn't being spoken to by the regular right [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7625.78s)]
*  or the center. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7629.16s)]
*  Or the left. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7630.0s)]
*  And I think it is maybe better to like stop name calling [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7630.84s)]
*  and start figuring out what the fuck. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7635.04s)]
*  Yeah, listen to the people and why they voted that way. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7637.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, like, you know what I'm saying? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7639.64s)]
*  We did that with Trump. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7643.32s)]
*  Every Trump supporter is a racist, blah, blah, blah. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7644.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, this guy gets elected [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7646.4s)]
*  and you're like, well, why don't we figure out why? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7648.24s)]
*  Okay, let's say he's racist, he's all these other things, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7650.24s)]
*  but what is he to these people? [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7652.4s)]
*  Why do they vote for him? [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7655.48s)]
*  And then I can speak to what you need better [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7656.5599999999995s)]
*  than I feel this quote unquote racist guy can. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7659.08s)]
*  I think that was a massive thing the leftists [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7661.96s)]
*  didn't want to do. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7663.799999999999s)]
*  It was just easy to discredit him. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7664.639999999999s)]
*  And then you end up discrediting those people [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7666.16s)]
*  and those people get frustrated. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7667.639999999999s)]
*  And they get more frustrated and more emboldened [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7668.839999999999s)]
*  to vote for this guy and that party [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7670.44s)]
*  and fuck you guys completely. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7671.96s)]
*  And less heard. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7672.799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7673.639999999999s)]
*  And just willing to go for the guy [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7674.46s)]
*  that's like saying the right shit, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7675.299999999999s)]
*  even if these don't have the policies to back it up. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7676.900000000001s)]
*  When you're not heard at all [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7677.820000000001s)]
*  and somebody speaks to what you're feeling, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7679.740000000001s)]
*  you can very easily block out [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7683.14s)]
*  all the other fuck shit they say. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7685.3s)]
*  So you might as well just hear these people. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7687.3s)]
*  Listen. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7689.660000000001s)]

*  they won't feel like there's only one option. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7692.660000000001s)]
*  They'll feel like every time they turn on the TV, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7694.780000000001s)]
*  they'll be like, oh yeah, wow, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7696.58s)]
*  I am frustrated for that reason. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7697.740000000001s)]
*  And you know what? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7699.46s)]
*  I don't have to vote for this super extreme guy [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7700.280000000001s)]
*  because at least I am being heard [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7702.14s)]
*  and hopefully these other politicians [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7703.38s)]
*  will listen to what's going on. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7704.660000000001s)]
*  Now, there is a certain percentage of them [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7705.54s)]

*  that are gonna be Islamophobes. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7710.18s)]
*  That also exists, but to paint them with that brush, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7711.5s)]
*  that's where you get dangerous [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7715.62s)]
*  because it does really make them go, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7716.86s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7804.04s)]
*  And then inflation went up what, 10%? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7804.88s)]
*  A lot. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7807.96s)]
*  In certain industries, it went up 50, maybe 100. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7808.8s)]
*  But overall inflation, I think went up, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7811.68s)]
*  they said 8% or something like that. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7813.8s)]
*  Bravo, central bank. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7818.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7820.52s)]
*  Well done, Fed. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7821.42s)]
*  We can talk about all the shit that they do. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7822.84s)]
*  But. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7825.2s)]
*  They managed the crisis well, you're saying. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7826.04s)]
*  They fucking managed it okay. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7826.860000000001s)]
*  Now, Argentina might have 100% inflation one day. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7829.64s)]
*  The next day, there's no money in the fucking ATMs. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7834.360000000001s)]
*  Their central bank, if they are in charge [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7836.320000000001s)]
*  of monetary policy and it is on them [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7838.88s)]
*  to make sure that they maintain the Argentine currency [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7841.240000000001s)]
*  and protect it, over the last whatever it is, [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7844.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't even know how long it is [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7846.78s)]
*  that they've had these kind of crises. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7848.46s)]
*  If they keep fucking up, my man has every right to be like, [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7849.86s)]
*  oh, they're not doing a job. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7852.78s)]
*  Get them out. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7853.82s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7854.66s)]
*  Peace. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7855.5s)]
*  If you say that about America, [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7856.54s)]
*  I need you to really convince me [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7858.54s)]
*  because it's gonna be hard to convince the four of us [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7861.099999999999s)]
*  sitting right here whose money seems to be doing okay. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7863.5s)]
*  Like, yeah, we're losing some value to inflation, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7867.139999999999s)]
*  but nothing compared to what Argentina would lose [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7869.46s)]
*  if they printed two trillion dollars in a fucking pandemic. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7871.36s)]
*  It's true. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7873.9s)]
*  So I do understand why he could say something like that [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7874.74s)]
*  when he's campaigning and people would be like, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7878.9s)]
*  yeah, fuck that bank. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7880.9s)]
*  Because one day I had $100, now I got 50. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7882.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7885.0199999999995s)]
*  And that sucks. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7885.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7886.7s)]
*  And if there's someone who's in charge of that shit [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7887.54s)]
*  and this keeps happening. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7889.74s)]
*  Get them. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7890.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7891.8s)]
*  Am I crazy to think that? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7893.66s)]
*  No, that makes sense. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7894.719999999999s)]
*  But he ain't gonna lie. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7895.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious how long he holds out. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7897.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, they're gonna kill him. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7899.099999999999s)]
*  Yo, you saw Lamello had to cover up his tattoo? [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7901.0199999999995s)]
*  No, what is it? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7903.76s)]
*  So he has LF, his middle name is LaFrance, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7904.76s)]
*  and he has LF tattooed underneath his ear. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7907.4400000000005s)]
*  And the NBA basically made him cover it up [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7909.96s)]
*  because his clothing brand is LF, I believe. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7911.52s)]
*  And what, the NBA has some sort of sponsorship? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7914.88s)]
*  They basically say you can't be advertising [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7916.96s)]
*  your own personal assets or your own personal endorsements. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7918.88s)]
*  What about his shoes that were his own brand? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7922.4400000000005s)]
*  So I don't know why that's an exception with the clause. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7924.76s)]
*  I don't actually understand what the deal is. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7927.6s)]
*  I guess these brands have direct partnerships with the NBA, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7929.76s)]
*  so if you do a sneaker with Nike [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7932.76s)]
*  or with some other brand, then it's okay. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7934.4800000000005s)]
*  But if it's your own personal thing, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7936.280000000001s)]
*  there was another player that had a Supreme tattoo, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7937.4400000000005s)]
*  I forget who it was. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7939.12s)]
*  Why didn't you just say that LF stands for something else? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7939.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean, it does stand for his middle name, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7943.84s)]
*  so technically I guess it works. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7945.8s)]
*  Yeah, I would just argue that one. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7946.88s)]
*  LF means something else, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7948.2s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7949.04s)]
*  But they said no. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7950.52s)]
*  I think this story. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7951.84s)]
*  Also the Supreme. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7953.360000000001s)]
*  It's like Akash accuracy. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7954.2s)]
*  Yep. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7956.0s)]
*  It was the Supreme Sleeve, and I think JR Smith wore it. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7956.84s)]
*  Same shit. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7959.4800000000005s)]
*  Remember JR Smith wore the Supreme Sleeve? [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7961.2s)]
*  It was like a leg sleeve or something like that. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7963.799999999999s)]
*  I think that there was an issue with And One tattoos. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7966.48s)]
*  And One might have even been paying players [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7969.36s)]
*  if they got the And One dude. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7971.5599999999995s)]
*  This could be Hindustani facts. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7974.32s)]
*  That's a better way to say it. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7978.16s)]
*  That's the cover-up. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7979.88s)]
*  So he has to cover it up during the game. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7982.2s)]
*  That's corny, dude. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7983.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry, that's corny. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7985.36s)]
*  It's your body, your joint. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7986.639999999999s)]
*  But like low-key. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7989.0s)]
*  But they probably on him heavy [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7990.8s)]
*  because they first did a big baller brand, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7992.08s)]
*  and I'm sure NBA wasn't cool with that. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7995.44s)]
*  But should you be able to advertise anything? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7998.36s)]
*  Like if you got a tattoo for some random brand, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=7999.84s)]
*  or your own personal brand. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8003.36s)]
*  As long as there's not like a morality clause in it. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8004.6s)]
*  Like for example, if you're advertising Brazzers [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8006.8s)]
*  or Pornhub, that might go against like the league standards. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8009.52s)]
*  Yeah, that makes us look. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8013.04s)]
*  But just like advertising a, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8013.96s)]
*  like let's say somebody had a fucking Rolex crown tattoo. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8016.36s)]
*  Like you gotta cover that up. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8019.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8020.400000000001s)]
*  Because it's Rolex. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8021.22s)]
*  Jordan can't get a Jumpman tattoo? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8022.06s)]
*  I guess they have a deal with the NBA, the Jordans. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8023.84s)]
*  But still, I don't know, that's goofy, bro. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8026.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8029.320000000001s)]
*  It seems like NBA's thing is just like, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8030.16s)]
*  yo, you're not gonna use us to advertise your personal shit [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8031.0s)]
*  unless we're getting a piece. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8032.84s)]
*  The fuck I'm not? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8033.68s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8034.84s)]
*  The fuck I'm not? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8035.68s)]
*  But they are employees for this organization, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8037.08s)]
*  and they're like, hey, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8044.0s)]
*  this is the rules of the organization. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8045.400000000001s)]
*  Technically, they're not employees of the NBA. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8047.24s)]
*  They're employees of the team, [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8051.5599999999995s)]
*  and the team hires the NBA to manage all the teams. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8053.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8058.08s)]
*  So the NBA is hired. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8058.92s)]
*  I know it feels like it's not that way, but. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8060.84s)]
*  So then when Jai's waving his gun, whose rules is he bringing? [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8063.48s)]
*  NBA is the sanctioning and the governing body of these teams, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8067.04s)]
*  but the owners come together and agree to let them have, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8069.98s)]
*  what is it, a governance? [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8074.04s)]
*  Well, then his point would still stand. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8075.84s)]
*  So then, like, the NBA is making the rules. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8077.280000000001s)]

*  they're not related or something like that. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8339.68s)]
*  There's a lot going on here. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8342.56s)]
*  But I looked into the book, the book isn't serious. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8344.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a satirical book. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8348.12s)]
*  It's satire. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8348.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's making fun of the thing [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8350.08s)]
*  that she ended up being, I guess. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8352.8s)]
*  Right, like it's like this is, if you wanna be a wife, [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8355.2s)]
*  you gotta go get all this plastic surgery, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8358.52s)]
*  and you gotta get your lips done, and your hair, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8360.44s)]
*  and you gotta spend all this. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8362.16s)]
*  It is tongue and cheek. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8363.44s)]
*  The whole thing is satire. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8364.56s)]
*  So. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8366.04s)]
*  It's not even like a real, it's like a short. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8368.2s)]
*  It's not like a full. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8369.72s)]
*  11 fucking pages or something like that. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8370.8s)]
*  It's not real. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8372.64s)]
*  So I think what's happening here is there's just a lot [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8374.24s)]
*  of pieces of information that if you look at them [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8376.92s)]
*  on the surface, they look really damning, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8380.5s)]
*  and you look at this young superstar, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8382.18s)]
*  potentially superstar athlete, and you're like, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8384.4s)]
*  oh fuck, did he get tricked by one of these women? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8385.88s)]
*  Because all the, he's taking the name of the ex, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8389.2s)]
*  is the ex actually living with them? [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8391.7s)]
*  She's much older, and she wrote this book. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8393.26s)]
*  But then you look in the book, and it is making fun [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8395.92s)]
*  of these women that end up doing that. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8398.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8400.820000000002s)]
*  So I'm curious, even her perspective on it, [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8401.86s)]
*  which is I wonder if she's like, I can't believe [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8404.480000000001s)]
*  I ended up being a wife of an athlete. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8406.58s)]
*  I used to make fun of these girls for fucking years. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8408.140000000001s)]
*  Like, what the hell is going on? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8410.18s)]
*  Like, I wonder if she could even reflect and be like, [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8411.900000000001s)]
*  I get it, this looks horrible. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8414.42s)]
*  Yeah, we joke about it all the time. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8416.820000000002s)]
*  We tease, I became this thing I made fun of. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8418.34s)]
*  I wonder that. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8422.46s)]
*  But on the surface, it looks atrocious, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8423.62s)]
*  and especially right now when you've got [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8426.7s)]
*  a incredibly popular red pill community on the internet, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8429.22s)]
*  which is dying for their newest woman [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8433.539999999999s)]
*  who is treating a man like shit that they could all bag on. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8436.18s)]
*  This looks like food. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8439.22s)]
*  Chilling in the waters, yeah. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8440.42s)]
*  Yeah, with like the wake of like the Dylan Logan stuff. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8441.42s)]
*  Oh, they're looking for their new version [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8443.78s)]
*  of Logan's fiance. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8445.66s)]
*  And this was served up right there. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8447.1s)]
*  And, but nobody bought the book. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8449.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8452.18s)]
*  Why would you? [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8453.220000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna learn that it isn't what it looks like [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8454.26s)]
*  from the outside. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8456.7s)]
*  Now, that being said, there are some other [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8457.58s)]
*  quite interesting and potentially dubious pieces [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8459.9s)]
*  of information here you'd like to get to the bottom of. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8462.460000000001s)]

*  Like, there better be a fucking reason. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8477.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8480.06s)]

*  The taking the name is wild. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8485.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8488.98s)]
*  But the ex-husband's there for what reason? [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8489.82s)]
*  I think of dietary reasons. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8491.34s)]
*  Yeah, they say he's the nutritionist. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8492.939999999999s)]
*  But again, this is from like a random Instagram account [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8495.46s)]
*  or a Twitter account that I'm reading this from. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8497.82s)]

*  He might be nice. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8516.38s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8575.98s)]
*  There is a corporatization of a fighting champion. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8577.66s)]
*  And that comes with making hundreds of millions of dollars [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8583.64s)]
*  by being champion. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8586.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8603.380000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, just not caring when you're in a position [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8616.86s)]
*  of power is like the most interesting thing. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8619.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8620.9s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8621.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8622.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8623.42s)]
*  But Fifth doesn't need to beat you up. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8624.26s)]
*  Fifth got this thing where he's like, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8628.14s)]
*  50 might beat a goat, bro. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8631.26s)]
*  50? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8634.22s)]
*  50 might beat a goat of goats because that motherfucker [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8635.06s)]
*  hasn't changed a bit and he's been in the most [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8638.22s)]
*  cancelable business that there is, which is Hollywood. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8641.06s)]
*  And he hasn't changed a bit. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8644.26s)]
*  His jokes hasn't changed, hasn't bit his tongue for nothing. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8645.82s)]
*  He must have something on these motherfuckers. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8649.740000000002s)]
*  He's had vitamin water money. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8651.740000000002s)]
*  He's had money to lose for 20 years. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8652.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8655.1s)]
*  Fifth the goat, bro. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8655.94s)]
*  Fifth is that dude. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8656.78s)]
*  Yo, Fifth, come on here, please. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8657.78s)]
*  And it's getting to the point where it's like, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8659.94s)]
*  if Fifth has a problem with somebody, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8661.7s)]
*  He's right. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8664.220000000001s)]
*  I'm starting to be like, [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8665.060000000001s)]
*  we might need to look into. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8667.02s)]
*  Think how scared. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8668.1s)]
*  If Fifth got a problem with somebody, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8668.94s)]
*  we might need to look into, [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8672.7s)]
*  because he don't just have random beef for nothing. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8674.34s)]
*  It felt like that initially, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8678.5s)]
*  because when we were coming up, [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8679.7s)]
*  there was this song, How to Rob, [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8681.26s)]
*  where Fifth was just going at everybody. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8682.94s)]
*  And I think this was this form of getting attention [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8684.86s)]
*  in an incredibly volatile art. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8688.54s)]
*  Say again? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8691.54s)]
*  Six-Nine. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8692.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, on some Six-Nines. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8693.220000000001s)]
*  But older Fifth is a little bit more pointed and targeted [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8694.300000000001s)]
*  in who he's talking about. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8700.220000000001s)]
*  And it's getting to the point where it's like, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8701.140000000001s)]
*  we might need to look into. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8705.300000000001s)]
*  And to your point about how he's fearless [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8706.740000000002s)]
*  and don't like, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8709.140000000001s)]
*  think of how scared everybody was to go at Diddy. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8710.26s)]
*  That's not even on some cancelable shit. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8713.18s)]
*  That's on some, we're actually frightened. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8714.740000000002s)]
*  You would hear whispers, you wouldn't hear, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8716.78s)]
*  Fifth was just saying things. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8718.220000000001s)]
*  But Fifth, part of his animosity towards Diddy [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8720.42s)]
*  is because Diddy fucked his baby moms. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8724.94s)]
*  Who was that? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8728.62s)]
*  I think the half Asian baby mom, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8731.1s)]
*  Fifth has a couple of baby moms. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8734.02s)]
*  So that kind of started, [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8736.1s)]
*  because remember they did a song together. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8738.82s)]
*  The billionaire song when it was him, Jay and Diddy, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8741.62s)]
*  JZ, Fifth, you remember that? [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8746.220000000001s)]
*  No, what's the song? [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8748.06s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8750.54s)]
*  I Got Money? [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8751.7s)]
*  Yeah, I Got Money remix. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8752.98s)]
*  I Got Money. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8755.02s)]
*  Yeah, so it was like, at one point in time, [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8755.98s)]
*  they were at least able to be on the same song together. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8758.52s)]
*  And then something went left. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8760.7s)]
*  And I think the left point happened to be. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8762.140000000001s)]
*  No, it was the parody. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8764.82s)]
*  That's what it was. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8766.779999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8767.94s)]
*  What happened? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u5I6_6yoE&t=8768.779999999999s)]
