# How to Get Into ANY Restaurant, Why Michelin Stars Are Nonsense & Building a Billion Dollar Business
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM)
*  What's up guys? Today we are joined by one of the most famous chefs in history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=0.0s)]
*  His restaurants have been frequented by everyone from half-white rappers to half-white presidents. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4.64s)]
*  His spot, Carbone, is harder to get into than a menopausal mothership. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9.52s)]
*  Jeff, I don't blame you, okay? We all get excited when a brown box gets delivered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=13.64s)]
*  Anyway, today he is going to tell us the number one trick to get into any restaurant in the world. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=18.12s)]
*  Why Michelin stars are nonsense. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=23.88s)]
*  And how to bet on yourself and build a business even in a recession. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=26.2s)]
*  Give it up for New York City's own, Mario Carbone. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=30.52s)]
*  Hey! [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=33.64s)]
*  Thank you. Are you proud of me? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=35.68s)]
*  Okay, I'm very excited for this. There are so many questions that I have to ask you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=36.96s)]
*  I want to learn about it all. But first of all, I want to know how... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=41.28s)]
*  How does someone get a reservation at Carbone? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=45.84s)]
*  Someone? Are we asking for you? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=48.92s)]
*  No, I just want to know someone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=50.68s)]
*  Already? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Someone knows someone, not even me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=53.28s)]
*  How does just a regular guy who doesn't have a podcast... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  It's a democratic society. I mean, it's a policy that's just one month out. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=57.72s)]
*  You're just going to lie to the people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=61.36s)]
*  You're going to lie to the people immediately at the beginning of the podcast. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Imagine this. Let's imagine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=66.04s)]
*  You have 200 seats to fill for a night to make your money. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=68.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=71.08s)]
*  You can't leave it to chance that these two people are going to come in, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=71.6s)]
*  they're going to fill those seats, and they're going to spend good money tonight. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=76.76s)]
*  So, of course, we keep information on everybody, like who's coming in, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=78.72s)]
*  who are our regulars, take care of those people, what's their spend, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=83.4s)]
*  so that I know these 200 people tonight are coming in, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=86.28s)]
*  not just a random set of people, because that's drastically going to change [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=90.12s)]
*  what we do tonight as a business. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=94.08s)]
*  So it's almost never random? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=95.44s)]
*  It's not never. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=97.6s)]
*  When was the last time you had a walk-up? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=99.08s)]
*  It happens, but at Carbone, it's rare because it's in such demand. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=101.56s)]
*  So we do put out reservations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=106.36s)]
*  Generally, what we do is we put out the sort of the shoulders, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=107.72s)]
*  We put out early. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=111.6s)]
*  5pm, 10pm. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=112.27999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because we have the internal demand to fill it with regulars. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  OK. Can somebody like grease a host? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=119.32s)]
*  You can get into it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=124.35999999999999s)]
*  It's not about necessarily greasing a host. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=127.8s)]
*  I would say... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=129.76s)]
*  Like you came in here, you greased me, right? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=130.44s)]
*  You gave me Cuban cigars. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=132.24s)]
*  These are real Cuban cigars. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=133.64s)]
*  Supposedly. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=135.48s)]
*  We got a connection at the airport. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=136.16s)]
*  You got at the airport? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  We snitching on our hities. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=139.24s)]
*  How are we doing? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=140.52s)]
*  Duty free. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=142.16s)]
*  So hold on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=143.76s)]
*  So these are real Cubans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, once we get a little lighter in here, we'll probably light these. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're not going to smoke, right? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=148.28s)]
*  Will you have one? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=149.64s)]
*  I've got too much asthma. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=150.2s)]
*  And then we need a little ashtray too. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  OK, so you come in and you grease me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=152.72s)]
*  I don't even know what this greasing gets, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=154.24s)]
*  You want to grease the kitchen? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=156.28s)]
*  How about you? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=157.64s)]
*  You already want to grease my kitchen one night? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=158.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=159.56s)]
*  You take the 5 o'clock, 5.30 reservation, bring in two cases of beer, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=160.0s)]

*  Be like, hey, it's for you guys tonight, chefs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  From me, Schultz, reservation of two, five o'clock. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=169.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=172.08s)]
*  See? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=173.12s)]

*  Now we're talking. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=174.96s)]
*  That cost you 30 bucks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=175.96s)]
*  And then what and what happens after that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=178.24s)]
*  They're going to be like, then one of the chefs will be like, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=180.12s)]
*  you know, someone just dropped two cases of beer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=182.36s)]
*  Like, who is it? I don't know. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=184.0s)]
*  Let's go find out. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=184.8s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=185.8s)]
*  Like, oh, Andrew Schultz, two top at five o'clock. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=186.36s)]
*  Has he been here before? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=188.96s)]
*  No, first time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=189.56s)]
*  Wow, he did the right thing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=190.4s)]
*  Send him out a little something from us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=192.04s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, your name starts to populate in our system. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=193.56s)]
*  Then maybe you order a nice bottle of wine, treat the staff nicely. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, the next time you call to make a reservation, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=201.6s)]
*  you give us your phone number, immediately your name is going to pop up [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=204.84s)]
*  and be like Andrew Schultz. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=207.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=208.4s)]
*  Oh, so there's a database that rewards the type of customer you are. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=208.72s)]
*  Well, it's it's more that we keep information on the notes on everybody. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=212.68s)]
*  And it can go from allergies, the table they like, the table they don't like, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=216.68s)]
*  preferential amount of time when they want to dine, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=221.0s)]
*  So we keep notes on everybody because that's that's the that's the crux [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=224.0s)]
*  of the business. Who's coming in tonight? Right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=227.04s)]
*  That's everything. We can't just open the door to random. Wow. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Does that go for every nice, exclusive restaurant? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=232.44s)]
*  Is this everyone keeps notes and they all do it their own way, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=234.88s)]
*  but everyone keeps notes on their customers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  And there's you know, there's software for this that help you track all this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=240.4s)]
*  information. How many times have they been there? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Was the last time they were there? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=245.84s)]
*  The beer move that would work in most places. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=246.95999999999998s)]

*  Right away. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=281.96s)]
*  Go all the way around. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=282.96s)]
*  OK. Oh, this is... [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=283.96s)]
*  They make a little vagina out of it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=284.96s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=286.4s)]
*  A little V-cutter. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=287.4s)]
*  OK, so... [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=288.4s)]
*  We call it a V-cutter. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=289.4s)]
*  Yeah, the V-cutter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=290.4s)]
*  Oh, this is the normal thing? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=291.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=292.4s)]
*  Oh, I thought this was like some crazy cigar cutter that we got here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=293.4s)]
*  It helps to knock canoe a little, you know? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  OK, so there is a way... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=298.32s)]
*  So back in the day, I would think you just tip well [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=300.88s)]
*  and all of a sudden that baby can get you something. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  It helps. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  What's well, though? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, 100%, 200%, what's well? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, 100% of the bill... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  That's insanity, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=310.88s)]
*  ...is insanity. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=311.88s)]
*  It happens. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=312.88s)]
*  You're talking tariffs now? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=313.88s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=314.88s)]
*  We've got one guy who comes in every now and again [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=315.88s)]
*  and will spend a great deal of money [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=319.56s)]
*  and regardless of what the bill is, leaves 100% tips. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=321.8s)]
*  So Rogan... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=324.68s)]
*  Every time I go out to eat with Rogan, he tips 100%. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=325.68s)]
*  Every single time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=330.08s)]
*  Which I tell him every single time is insane, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=331.08s)]
*  but I want the waiters and the staff at the restaurant to make some money. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=332.6s)]
*  I never even considered the idea of walking into the kitchen with alcohol [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  when the restaurant already has alcohol and then hand... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=342.48s)]
*  How do I even get into the kitchen? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  The kitchen's not getting the restaurant's alcohol. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  So at the end of the night, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=350.0s)]
*  they're going to have your two cases of beer to crack open. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=351.88s)]
*  After a long service, they're hot, they're sweaty. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=354.0s)]
*  It's been a long night. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  But the kitchen still has agency, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  meaning they can send out some dishes, send out a little extra. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=358.88s)]
*  They're guaranteed you're going to get a little something. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=362.04s)]
*  So when I had my daughter, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=364.36s)]
*  somebody told me, they were like, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=367.32s)]
*  listen, you got to take care of the staff at the hospital. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=368.56s)]
*  If you go out and get food, get pizza for everybody. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=370.92s)]
*  You go out and get bagels, get bagels for everybody. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=372.96s)]
*  And... [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=375.64s)]
*  They did nothing different than I expected. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=377.6s)]
*  But it seemed like... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=381.2s)]
*  Maybe we did. I'm not even sure. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=383.12s)]
*  Actually, I think they delayed the pregnancy [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=384.96s)]
*  as much as they possibly could to keep on getting free food. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=386.8s)]
*  My wife was in labor for 24 hours. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=389.56s)]
*  If I got them some Snickers or whatever, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  maybe we would have had that baby in six. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=393.44s)]
*  Yeah, why wait? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=394.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm incentivizing them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=395.88s)]
*  Well, this is a traditional... [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if you're at a sushi bar, that's a classic move. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=399.32s)]
*  It's like, hey, you get a round of beers for all the sushi chefs. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=401.44s)]
*  That's a classic move. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=404.4s)]
*  So first thing you do when you sit in a nice sushi bar, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=406.12s)]
*  buy a round of beers for all the chefs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=408.76s)]
*  This is disenchanging. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  One of the reasons we're so excited to sit down with you [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=411.88s)]
*  is learning restaurant etiquette from the inside. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=413.84s)]
*  I feel like it is so... [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  And I want to get into your history. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=419.08s)]
*  I want to get into how you built this thing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=420.44s)]
*  and how you put those other two guys [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=422.36s)]
*  that don't do much on your back. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=425.32s)]
*  I really want... [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=426.32s)]
*  I mean, what are those guys' names again? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=427.32s)]
*  Zazenick or something like that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=429.32s)]
*  And what is it? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  Torino or something? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=433.68s)]
*  Yeah, Toronto. Toronto and Zazenick. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=434.68s)]
*  He's down the block. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=436.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no. Great guys. Great guys. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=437.36s)]
*  Lucky. No. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=439.68s)]
*  No, no. But in all seriousness, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=442.64s)]
*  understanding this kind of stuff [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  offers crazy value to the average consumer. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  So you're bringing a couple cases of beer. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=450.52s)]
*  Now, what happens if a waiter goes, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=452.32s)]
*  why are you going into the kitchen with two cases of beer? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=453.52s)]
*  No, no. Commonplace. Or you give it to the waiter [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=455.52s)]
*  and say, hey, I brought a couple cases of beer for the kitchen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=457.04s)]
*  Does the type of beer matter? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, chefs drink simple, cold, easy drink. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=461.52s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=465.52s)]
*  Throw them back a bottle. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=466.52s)]
*  Yeah, don't bring them any weird, hazy IPAs. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=467.52s)]
*  They don't want that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=470.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=471.12s)]
*  From what I think the chefs are, Corona. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=472.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=473.92s)]
*  Tic-toc-tic. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=475.52s)]
*  I'm a Dela for the boys. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=476.52s)]
*  I'm a little Modelo. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=477.52s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=478.52s)]
*  I'm mad at a Modelo. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  OK, there's a good question. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  Actually, no, no, I want to stay on these hacks. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  You're going. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  I got a call for you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  You order a nice... [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  So this is a front of the house. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  You're going to get some appreciation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  You order a bottle of champagne. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  Whether you're talking to the waiter or the sommelier, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  you order the bottle of champagne, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=498.59999999999997s)]
*  and right before they leave, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  you kind of grab them, give them a little whisper, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  and say, I don't want the champagne flutes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  Bring me wine glasses. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  A real wine drinker never, ever drink champagne [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=507.68s)]
*  out of champagne flutes. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=511.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  This is bars. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  And the second you tell them, I want... [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  If you say, AP glasses, which is all-purpose, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  or you say, bring me wine glasses for the champagne, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  that immediately says, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  you know what the fuck you're talking about. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  And that helps. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know it helps. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  It's better for the champagne. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  The whole, like, no one likes drinking [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  out of these skinny little things. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  It's actually not great for the champagne. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=532.6800000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  You want a real wine glass for your champagne. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=535.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=538.76s)]
*  No one ever does that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=539.76s)]
*  So the second you tell them that, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=540.76s)]
*  that immediately puts them on, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=541.76s)]
*  that you know what you're talking about. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=542.76s)]
*  And you get a little more respect. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=544.76s)]
*  You get immediate... [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=545.76s)]
*  You're going to get immediate respect. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=546.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=548.76s)]
*  And I know, honestly, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=549.76s)]
*  and it makes sense that it is this way, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=550.76s)]
*  but I never considered that it was similar to, like, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=552.76s)]
*  the nightclub, in that the more that you spend, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=554.76s)]
*  the more data you're giving the restaurant, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=558.76s)]
*  and the more they're going to prioritize you in the future. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=560.76s)]
*  I never even considered it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=563.76s)]
*  It's all digital. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=564.84s)]
*  So as soon as, you know, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=565.84s)]
*  once you call for the second time, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=566.84s)]
*  immediately the person that's on my team, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=568.84s)]
*  that's picking up the phone or looking at the email, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=571.84s)]
*  has side by side your information. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=574.84s)]
*  You're at the back of your baseball card. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=577.84s)]
*  Here's what you do. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=579.84s)]
*  Here's who you are. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=580.84s)]
*  Here are your likes, dislikes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=581.84s)]
*  Here's what you spent. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=582.84s)]
*  Here's... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=583.84s)]
*  Not that it's always about spending. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=584.84s)]
*  We just want to curate a room so that it's not random. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=585.84s)]
*  So what we're trying to figure out [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=588.84s)]
*  is what the cheapest way to get currency [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=589.84s)]
*  in the restaurant is. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  So bringing the beers... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=594.9200000000001s)]
*  Great one. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  ...to the staff. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=596.9200000000001s)]
*  This is already assuming you got the res. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm curious when you walk up to the door, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  there's the maitre d' which I have a long-lasting beef [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  with maitre d's in New York City. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  You want to get into it? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  I just get frustrated sometimes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, because you get this girl, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=608.9200000000001s)]
*  she graduated college like a year and a half ago. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  She holds power over this entire restaurant, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  every person that comes in. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  Is there anything you can do or say to a maitre d [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=614.9200000000001s)]
*  that might kind of tilt the scales in your favor? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=616.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  Saying, oh, my mom's in town [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  and she's having a birthday. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  Anything that would kind of... [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=623.0s)]
*  I mean, they're going to see through those. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=627.0s)]
*  I mean, walk up reservations, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=628.0s)]
*  because at that point, you're at their mercy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=630.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ricky. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=632.0s)]
*  I think try to kill them with kindness. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=633.0s)]
*  You'll take anything. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=635.0s)]
*  Listen, I'll take your worst two seats. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=636.0s)]
*  I'll take the bar stools. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=638.0s)]
*  I'll take whatever you got. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=639.0s)]
*  So instead of trying to big shot, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=642.0s)]
*  humbling yourself. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=644.0s)]
*  Because that's all they've got, right? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=645.0s)]
*  All they've got is this little bit of power [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=647.0s)]
*  that they've been given at this front desk, to your point. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=648.0s)]
*  I would go with, listen, I'll take whatever it is. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=651.08s)]
*  Give me your worst two seats. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=654.08s)]
*  I'll be happy tonight. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=655.08s)]
*  I'll be in and out quick. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=656.08s)]
*  That's... [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=658.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=659.08s)]
*  I got a thing at eight o'clock. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=660.08s)]
*  Because they have to worry about [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=661.08s)]
*  what's been plotted for the night, right? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=662.08s)]
*  Like, so at Carbone, it's a two and a half... [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=664.08s)]
*  It's about a two and a half hour meal. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=666.08s)]
*  So we're plotting these reservations, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=668.08s)]
*  It's a very tricky little dance [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=670.08s)]
*  that we are assuming the 530 reservation [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=672.08s)]
*  is going to be done at eight o'clock, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=674.08s)]
*  But it may not happen that way. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=676.08s)]
*  So the fact that if they've got an extra day [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=678.08s)]
*  and they've got an extra table, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  they might give it to you if you're like, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=681.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be in and out quick. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  Does how you dress for the walk-up make any difference? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  It depends on the restaurant. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  If you look like this... [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  Look, I'll trim it a little bit. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  I would trim it a little. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=691.1600000000001s)]
*  I think it depends on the restaurant a little bit. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=692.1600000000001s)]
*  But really, I would say kill them with kindness, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  try to get in and out quick. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  I'll take any seat you got. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  What about the friendly handshake [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  with a little cash in it? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's as old as time. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=703.1600000000001s)]
*  Does that work? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  I think it works. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm not advocating for it [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  because my team is very well paid. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=708.24s)]
*  But I mean, I'm sure... [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=710.24s)]
*  Would that be offensive? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=711.24s)]
*  Obviously not in your establishments, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=712.24s)]
*  but in another restaurant? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=713.24s)]
*  Like if you were to be like, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=714.24s)]
*  hey, this is a little 20 bucks. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=715.24s)]
*  You'd think a maitre d'oeuvre would be like... [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=716.24s)]
*  Oh, like it could be beneath them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=717.24s)]
*  Who the fuck are you? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=719.24s)]
*  You're trying to pay me 20 bucks to get you a table. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=720.24s)]
*  If it turns out you're like talking to the general manager [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=722.24s)]
*  and not just like a well-paid general manager [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=725.24s)]
*  and you try to give him a 20 spot, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=729.24s)]
*  he's going to be like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=730.24s)]
*  what are you doing here? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=731.24s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=732.24s)]
*  Well, I tried to pull the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=733.24s)]
*  I know the owner thing once at... [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=734.24s)]
*  Carbone? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=736.24s)]
*  No. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=737.32s)]
*  That's this week. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=740.32s)]
*  No. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=741.32s)]
*  At Emilio's, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=742.32s)]
*  Emilio Bolano's, whatever. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=743.32s)]
*  And I'm talking to this big guy out front [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=744.32s)]
*  and I'm like, yeah, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=746.32s)]
*  Emilio told me to come by [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=747.32s)]
*  and just a table for two, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=748.32s)]
*  whatever like that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=750.32s)]
*  And he's like, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=751.32s)]
*  oh, did he? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=752.32s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=753.32s)]
*  He said, what time did he tell you to come? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=754.32s)]
*  And I'm like, around like 7.30, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=755.32s)]
*  whatever like that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=757.32s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm a little bit early. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=758.32s)]
*  He goes, okay, cool. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=759.32s)]
*  All right, yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=760.32s)]
*  Well, we'll figure it out. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=761.32s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, I walk away. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=762.32s)]

*  I knew it was you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=795.48s)]
*  Okay, so you got a lot of good restaurants [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=798.48s)]

*  Andrew and I argue a lot of times. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=801.48s)]
*  He's become this like real foodie type. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=802.48s)]
*  And... [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=804.48s)]
*  That was really derogatory. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=805.48s)]
*  It was. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=806.48s)]
*  And I meant it in a derogatory way. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=807.48s)]
*  Because he's very pretentious about it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=809.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=811.48s)]

*  It was the best restaurant experience [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=814.48s)]
*  I've had in the city because it didn't... [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=815.48s)]
*  It was elevated, but didn't feel pretentious. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=816.48s)]
*  A lot of times I'll go to Michelin stars places [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=819.48s)]
*  and I end up being underwhelmed. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=821.48s)]
*  Not a lot of times, a few times. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=823.48s)]

*  you know this is going to be a solid [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=827.5600000000001s)]

*  There's a lot there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  A lot to unroll. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  There's a... [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  Get it? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  I see what you're doing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=836.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a tire. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=837.5600000000001s)]
*  Ah! [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  Michelin started as a subsidy for the tire company. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  Now it's no longer. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  So now it's a business. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think you got to take that with a grain of salt. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  They're in their own business of selling books. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  Michelin's tricky for a lot of reasons. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  If you're to the restaurant, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=853.64s)]
*  the kind of restaurant you're talking about, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=855.64s)]
*  they're going for that accolade. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=857.64s)]
*  There's this sort of assumption that you have to do it [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=860.64s)]
*  in a really tight way, a really library style, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=863.64s)]
*  hush environment, very sort of the chef is right, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=868.64s)]
*  he wants you to eat this from the left to the right [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=871.64s)]
*  sort of environment because they're coveting these stars. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=873.64s)]
*  I don't know if that's a good business model. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=878.64s)]
*  I don't know if that's a good business model. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=880.72s)]
*  We are the opposite, right? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=882.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=884.72s)]
*  I think that chefs, well-trained high-level chefs, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=885.72s)]
*  fall in one of two categories [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=888.72s)]
*  and we're firmly on one side than the other. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=890.72s)]
*  There's two categories. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=892.72s)]
*  Not that there's anything wrong with the two categories, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=893.72s)]
*  but there's two firm categories. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=895.72s)]
*  One category is the chef that spends all their training, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=896.72s)]
*  all their work, their life, their life's journey [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=899.72s)]
*  to make something that you've never had before. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=901.72s)]
*  That's a very dangerous proposition. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=905.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=907.72s)]
*  But if you have whatever this thing is [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  and you don't like it, the chef can at least fall back [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  on the ego and say, you don't get it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  You didn't get what I was going for. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the pretentiousness. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that infuriates me because it's like, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  no, I get what tastes good and what doesn't, dude. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  And I preach to my team and my chefs, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=925.8000000000001s)]
*  we're on the other side of that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  We are equally dangerous. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  We are trying to make for you the thing that you've had [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=931.8000000000001s)]
*  thousands of times before. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=934.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  And I want to make one of the best ones you've ever had, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=936.88s)]
*  but you know exactly what it's like. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=938.88s)]
*  So I can't be like, oh, he didn't get that meatball. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=940.88s)]
*  You're competing with their grandma. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=942.88s)]
*  Yeah, like, you know what a meatball is, right? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=944.88s)]
*  You may not know what that chef was trying to go for, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=946.88s)]
*  but if you didn't like it, it's probably not good. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=948.88s)]
*  Yeah, and you don't have that fallback. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=950.88s)]
*  But if I win, I've got a customer for life. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=952.88s)]
*  I've got someone that's come in multiple times a week. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=956.88s)]
*  If that chef wins, you may go once a year. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=958.88s)]
*  You may actually never go back again, even if it's great. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=961.88s)]
*  I never go back to those places, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=963.88s)]
*  even if it's the really abstract ones. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=965.96s)]
*  It's a fun, cool experience. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=967.96s)]
*  But it's like, I recently went to places called, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=969.96s)]
*  it's a Chicago chef, he had throat cancer [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=973.96s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=976.96s)]
*  Alinea. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=977.96s)]
*  Alinea just did a pop-up in Brooklyn. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=978.96s)]
*  And my wife and I went. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=980.96s)]
*  And the food was great, and we got into a nice argument, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=981.96s)]
*  which is uncomfortable for all the other people [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=985.96s)]
*  during our seating. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=987.96s)]
*  That's fun, though. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=988.96s)]
*  That's love. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=989.96s)]
*  That's real. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=990.96s)]
*  You're honest. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=991.96s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=992.96s)]
*  Not only at a communal table, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=993.96s)]
*  so they had to deal with that fight four or five times. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=995.0400000000001s)]
*  And it was new people sitting next to us [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  every different time. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=999.0400000000001s)]
*  So you wouldn't let go. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  No! [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1001.0400000000001s)]
*  Not letting this go! [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1002.0400000000001s)]
*  Just because you put the dessert all over the table, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1003.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to let the fucking fight go? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1006.0400000000001s)]
*  For the record, everyone in the restaurant loves that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  Going to dinner with my wife, seeing a couple working, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1009.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, yes! [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's theater! [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  It's the best theater! [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1014.0400000000001s)]
*  It's just fun to listen. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  You're like at dinner and a show. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1016.0400000000001s)]
*  Bro, it was, I mean, because the lad at the end of the dessert, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  it's all deconstructed or whatever. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1020.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's Three Michelin Stars. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1022.0400000000001s)]
*  That's the highest award. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1024.12s)]
*  At one point, he was the highest rated American restaurant we had. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1025.12s)]
*  I literally pay you to construct the food. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1028.12s)]
*  I never paid anybody to take some shit apart from me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1030.12s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1032.12s)]
*  Believe me, I can do that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1033.12s)]
*  I can take apart a lasagna. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1034.12s)]
*  But I will say the food was good, but you would hate it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1036.12s)]
*  You definitely would hate it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1038.12s)]
*  It's important that they exist. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1039.12s)]
*  It's just not in my mind. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1040.12s)]
*  I'm in a business model. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1041.12s)]
*  We're at the corner of art and commerce. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1042.12s)]
*  Like, I'm in a business model, right? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1044.12s)]
*  Like, there's nothing wrong with the business model. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1046.12s)]
*  I'm in a business model. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1049.12s)]
*  I'm in a business model. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1050.12s)]
*  I'm in a business model. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1051.12s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with preaching the art [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1052.1999999999998s)]
*  and teaching the art of business. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1055.1999999999998s)]
*  That is also a craft, and we need to keep the lights out, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  and we need to keep people paid. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1060.1999999999998s)]
*  Do you know how much money your wait staff makes? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1062.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, depending on the restaurant, a substantial amount. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1065.1999999999998s)]
*  Like, what does a waiter at Carbone in Miami make? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1068.1999999999998s)]
*  Like, on average? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  Over $150,000 a year. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1073.1999999999998s)]
*  So, you're guaranteed $150,000 a year, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  and that's what's on the books. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1078.1999999999998s)]
*  That's not even, like, people throwing them [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1080.28s)]
*  a little shit on the side. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1081.28s)]
*  Well, yeah, but there's very little cash these days. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1082.28s)]
*  Everything's cards. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1084.28s)]
*  You know, no one carries cash anymore. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1085.28s)]
*  No one. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1087.28s)]
*  So, I always wondered, like, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1088.28s)]
*  do some of your staff that was in, like, cash tip positions [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1089.28s)]
*  get upset about that? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1091.28s)]
*  Like, the people that are doing valet, these, like, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1092.28s)]
*  how do they manage that? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1097.28s)]
*  Their whole life was cash tips. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1098.28s)]
*  I guess valet is still... [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1100.28s)]
*  I'm trying to think of when I carry cash at this point. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1101.28s)]
*  Valet is one of the few ones that you still want to have that, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1104.28s)]
*  you know? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1107.28s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1108.36s)]
*  But the wait staff, it's all in credit cards, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1109.36s)]
*  which is good because it actually used to be really dangerous [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1113.36s)]
*  because these restaurants have all this cash. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1115.36s)]
*  At the end of the week, some employees got to take, like, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1117.36s)]
*  comical bags of cash and might as well have a dollar sign on it [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1120.36s)]
*  to a bank that is waiting to get robbed. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1124.36s)]
*  Because you were putting it all in the bank. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1126.36s)]
*  Yeah, like, all in it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1128.36s)]
*  100% of it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1129.36s)]
*  Yeah, you were giving it to Ricky the Face [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1131.36s)]
*  to go put under a mattress. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1134.36s)]
*  We got to go to the mattresses, it's COVID. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  But, yo, it is a crazy thing because, like, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1140.4399999999998s)]
*  restaurants in the city, any, like, small mom pop business [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1142.4399999999998s)]
*  in the city that dealt with cash was given, like, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1144.4399999999998s)]
*  if you want to be generous, 50% of it to the government. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1146.4399999999998s)]
*  And that business completely changed [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  now that everything goes digital. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1151.4399999999998s)]
*  So you got to adjust to shit. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1153.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, for that same reason. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1154.4399999999998s)]
*  Wait, wasn't Carbone only cash initially? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1156.4399999999998s)]
*  No, never. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1158.4399999999998s)]
*  Just with me? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1159.4399999999998s)]
*  That was strictly your policy. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1160.4399999999998s)]
*  It was me policy. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1162.4399999999998s)]
*  Because the card kept bouncing. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because we didn't take that card you had. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1165.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, what was that? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1167.52s)]
*  I think that was a... [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1168.52s)]
*  Capital One. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1169.52s)]
*  It was a diner's card. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1170.52s)]
*  Uncle Rush card. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1171.52s)]
*  He's like, I take gift cards? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1173.52s)]
*  When I go to, like, some of my favorite bars or lounges, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1176.52s)]
*  I bring cash just so I can tip with the cash. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1179.52s)]
*  Because I know for that particular reason, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1182.52s)]
*  they appreciate that way more than if you just put [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1184.52s)]
*  all the tips on the credit card receipt. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1186.52s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1188.52s)]
*  Also, guys, this weekend, I'm going to be in the best [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1189.52s)]

*  But you make sure you watch that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1293.84s)]
*  You leave some comments. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1294.84s)]
*  You share with friends. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1296.84s)]
*  We support family over here. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1297.84s)]
*  Derrick is flagrant family. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1299.84s)]
*  So get after it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1301.84s)]
*  Go watch it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1302.84s)]
*  Let's run these fucking numbers up. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1303.84s)]
*  Create another superstar out there. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1305.84s)]
*  He's absolutely hilarious. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1307.84s)]
*  Leave a bunch of comments. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1308.84s)]
*  Share it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1309.84s)]
*  Show the love. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1310.9199999999998s)]
*  Show that flagrant family love. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1311.9199999999998s)]
*  Right now, it's our boy Derrick Poston. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1313.9199999999998s)]
*  We're very proud of you, Derrick. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1314.9199999999998s)]

*  Love you, Derrick. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm curious, back to the Michelin thing, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1318.9199999999998s)]
*  like the politics of the Michelin. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1319.9199999999998s)]
*  Like I have a friend that has a restaurant in Brooklyn [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1321.9199999999998s)]
*  that plays bar Madonna. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1324.9199999999998s)]
*  But he talks to me about getting on the list. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1325.9199999999998s)]
*  Like you want to be on the best bars list. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  Like there's all this politics you have to play, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1329.9199999999998s)]
*  not only having a great experience with your consumers, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1331.9199999999998s)]
*  but playing the game of the restaurant. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  So as far as getting a Michelin star or playing in that world, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1335.9199999999998s)]
*  how important is it to be in the good graces of the critics, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1339.0s)]
*  being on blogs, things like that, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1342.0s)]
*  to promote the brand of the restaurant? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1344.0s)]
*  If you're going for that, if that's a goal of yours, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1346.0s)]
*  then it's important. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1349.0s)]
*  Michelin can't possibly be what they say they are [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1352.0s)]
*  or what they have been. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1357.0s)]
*  So like Michelin in the past started in France, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1358.0s)]
*  you know, 50s and 60s. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1362.0s)]
*  There would be a anonymous inspector [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1364.0s)]
*  that would come every year and check on your restaurant. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1366.0s)]
*  And grade it basically. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1369.0s)]
*  For that to still happen today [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1372.0s)]
*  in the number of restaurants and numbers of cities [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1374.0s)]
*  that Michelin is in is virtually impossible. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1376.0s)]
*  There's no way they're checking on these restaurants. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1380.0s)]
*  So it's my belief that it's simply an aggregate. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1384.0s)]
*  They're just aggregating where they need to sell books [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1388.0s)]
*  and what the reviews of the rest of the world are [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1391.0s)]
*  of these places and figuring out who to give stars to. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1394.0s)]
*  I think there's a handful of people [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1397.08s)]
*  that are actually going to some of these restaurants. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1398.08s)]
*  Like the top couple brass of Michelin [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1400.08s)]
*  are going to the important ones, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1402.08s)]
*  but there's no way they're going to all of them. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1403.08s)]
*  So it's really just some sort of aggregate system [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1405.08s)]
*  they're using to give out these stars. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1407.08s)]
*  It's no longer like the movie Ratatouille [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1409.08s)]
*  kind of like projects this. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1413.08s)]
*  Like that's a Michelin inspector basically, right? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1414.08s)]
*  At least at the New York Times, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1417.08s)]
*  which is for me the most important review in New York, right? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1419.08s)]
*  The New York Times critics say, you know who it is. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1422.08s)]
*  It's a single person's opinion [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1425.08s)]
*  whether you like it or not. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1426.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a real person. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not some sort of computer generated aggregate. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  And take this for a grain of salt. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  We only have one Michelin star. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1433.1599999999999s)]
*  They took a couple away from me a couple years ago. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  It is what it is, but like, you know, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  I could easily be seen as someone [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  who's just kind of grumpy about it, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1439.1599999999999s)]
*  but I just think as a system, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1440.1599999999999s)]
*  and it's nothing that we necessarily covet, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1442.1599999999999s)]
*  but as a system, I just don't think they're being honest [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  with who they are as a criteria. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1446.1599999999999s)]
*  So you're saying there's other motives here at play. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1449.1599999999999s)]
*  There's a financial motive. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  They used to be a subsidy of this tire company, right? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1453.1599999999999s)]
*  And the whole idea was that they created this map [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1455.24s)]
*  of restaurants so that you and your car [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1458.24s)]
*  on your Michelin tires would drive [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1462.24s)]
*  from restaurant to restaurant. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1464.24s)]
*  And it was a fun way to promote it. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1465.24s)]
*  It became really big and then it became, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1466.24s)]
*  it spawned into its own business. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1468.24s)]
*  So you have to look at it and say, this is its own business. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1470.24s)]
*  It has to make its own dollars. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1473.24s)]
*  So as a business, there's just no way, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1475.24s)]
*  given what they do in revenue and book sales, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1477.24s)]
*  that they could pay enough people to go to all these restaurants. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1479.24s)]
*  So if that's the case, then how are they coming up with this? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1482.24s)]
*  It's a fugazi. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1484.32s)]
*  So then in that case. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1485.32s)]
*  It's a fugazi. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1486.32s)]
*  What's more important? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1487.32s)]
*  Like if you're going to a city [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1488.32s)]
*  and you want to know what the good restaurants are. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1489.32s)]
*  Yeah, how do you know? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1491.32s)]
*  And you don't use a Michelin star. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1492.32s)]
*  Is there another review system? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1493.32s)]
*  Is there an app? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1494.32s)]
*  Is there a website? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1495.32s)]
*  How else can I be informed [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1496.32s)]
*  about the best restaurant in the city? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1497.32s)]
*  I mean, social media is going to tell you. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1498.32s)]
*  I mean, if you punch in best restaurant, pick your city, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1500.32s)]
*  you're going to get 10 at least. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1503.32s)]
*  But it's a pay for. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1505.32s)]
*  Infatuation, have you heard of that one? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1506.32s)]
*  Yeah, infatuation. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1508.32s)]
*  I mean, they don't speak kindly to me in Miami, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1509.32s)]
*  but they do in New York. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1511.32s)]
*  Two totally different groups of people in the same publication. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  But they're definitely going to pop up. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1515.3999999999999s)]
*  You're going to get CNN Traveler. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1517.3999999999999s)]
*  You're going to get all these things that are going to pop up. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  But the biggest thing that's changed [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1521.3999999999999s)]
*  in the restaurant business is that [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  the power of these critics has been [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  basically completely taken away [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1527.3999999999999s)]
*  and put in the customer's hands. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  Everyone has it now. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1531.3999999999999s)]
*  Everyone's an editor in chief of their own thing. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1533.3999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1535.3999999999999s)]
*  No matter how big their Facebook is or their Instagram page, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1536.3999999999999s)]
*  they're going to tell you all about their meal. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1539.3999999999999s)]
*  And if you follow them, you're going to go... [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1541.48s)]
*  They're the critic. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1543.48s)]
*  There's a... [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1544.48s)]
*  People always say a lot of times comics [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1546.48s)]
*  like compare ourselves to boxers for some reason. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1548.48s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1551.48s)]
*  And whoever does that has never boxed at all. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1552.48s)]
*  But I always say the closest comparison for comedians is chefs. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1554.48s)]
*  My chef friend says it's the closest comparison to comedians. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1557.48s)]
*  And just in terms of like speaking to them, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1560.48s)]
*  it's a couple different things. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1562.48s)]
*  One, the kind of natural people pleasers, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1563.48s)]
*  like we're doing this thing, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1564.48s)]
*  we're creating this thing for other people to consume [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1565.48s)]
*  and hopefully they like it [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1567.48s)]
*  and we're kind of waiting for them to tell us that they like it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1568.48s)]
*  The hours also. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1570.56s)]
*  And just like degenerates. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1572.56s)]
*  Just like really kind of bad people at our core. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1574.56s)]
*  Dredge of society. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1577.56s)]
*  Dredge of society that somehow managed to make money [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1578.56s)]
*  doing this like weird thing. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1581.56s)]
*  It's a circus. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1582.56s)]
*  It is a circus. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1583.56s)]
*  100%. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1584.56s)]
*  You're in these restaurants and you're managing the staff. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1585.56s)]
*  They're all fucking each other. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1591.56s)]
*  How do you stop that? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1593.56s)]
*  I don't know anything about that. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1594.56s)]
*  I worked in restaurants for years. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  Listen, I think. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1599.6399999999999s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  How do you? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  The team going out after work and having drinks [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1602.6399999999999s)]
*  and letting some steam off of a long night is totally normal [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  and we're not going to get in the way of that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1610.6399999999999s)]
*  I think certainly we have rules that like management [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1612.6399999999999s)]
*  and hourly staff can't cope mingle. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1615.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1618.6399999999999s)]
*  Like that's just rule number one. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1619.6399999999999s)]
*  And as soon as that happens, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1621.6399999999999s)]
*  there's zero tolerance there. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1623.6399999999999s)]
*  But the staff, I mean, they become family. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1625.72s)]
*  I have the same team in Carbone, the original Carbone, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1628.72s)]
*  since basically day one. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1631.72s)]
*  No one's left. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1633.72s)]
*  It's all the same team. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1634.72s)]
*  Starting with Ricky. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1635.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1636.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1637.72s)]
*  How do you know Ricky? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1638.72s)]
*  Ricky was a day one guy who answered an ad for captains. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1639.72s)]
*  The head waiters are captains for a captain position [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1646.72s)]
*  and loved him immediately and he grew into being the face. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1649.72s)]
*  I call him the face because everyone knows him. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1653.8s)]
*  Everyone knows him as Ricky of Carbone. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1655.8s)]
*  Before we get too far away, two things. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1657.8s)]
*  Do you think a Michelin star can be bought? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1660.8s)]
*  I think you got to play the game a little bit. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1664.8s)]
*  If that's something you're going after, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1668.8s)]
*  if that's a really important metric for your restaurant [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1670.8s)]
*  and for success and for getting people in there, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1673.8s)]
*  then you have to play a game to a certain degree. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1675.8s)]
*  And that being buying it could manifest itself [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1679.8799999999999s)]
*  in the things you buy for the restaurant, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1683.8799999999999s)]
*  all of the extra money you spend towards the things [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1686.8799999999999s)]
*  that you think you need to get that star. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1689.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can pay Michelin for a star. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  Cities pay Michelin, which is commonplace. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1695.8799999999999s)]
*  Cities pay it to bring them to that city [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  to create a Michelin whatever. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  Which makes sense. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1704.8799999999999s)]
*  But that's just like the... [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1706.8799999999999s)]
*  Michelin guide? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1707.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the Michelin guide. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1708.96s)]
*  So the Michelin guide is paid for. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1709.96s)]
*  It's paid for by the cities to bring them there. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1711.96s)]
*  Which makes sense if you're a tourist in Miami. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1714.96s)]
*  No, it makes perfect sense. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1717.96s)]
*  I thought Michelin guide was the achievement [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1719.96s)]
*  right before Michelin star. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1721.96s)]
*  Because sometimes the way people speak about it, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1723.96s)]
*  they're like, oh, it's not Michelin star, but it's guide. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1725.96s)]
*  You can be included in the book without having a star [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1727.96s)]
*  where they sort of recommend you, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1730.96s)]
*  especially if you're at a lower price point. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1732.96s)]
*  If you're at a really low price point, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1733.96s)]
*  usually you're not even up for a star. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1735.96s)]
*  This is really just kind of the world [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1737.04s)]
*  of fine dining more or less. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1739.04s)]
*  And then the second question, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1740.04s)]
*  because you said now the power's in the customer's hand. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1742.04s)]
*  But I feel like restaurants are just paying influencers, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1745.04s)]
*  hey, here's some money, come here, eat for free, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1749.04s)]
*  do a review on us. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1752.04s)]
*  So it's like, I don't trust a lot of the TikTok [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1753.04s)]
*  because they'll do it on the same restaurants over and over. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1755.04s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm a little suspect about this. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1757.04s)]
*  That is marketing these days. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1760.04s)]
*  I mean, it's not that much different [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1763.04s)]
*  than paying some agency to tell you [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1765.12s)]
*  how great this restaurant is. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1768.12s)]
*  Bro, it's more effective. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1770.12s)]
*  Yeah, so then how do we find it? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1771.12s)]
*  I guess you just need to trust it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1772.12s)]
*  No, no, I understand. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1773.12s)]
*  But when Kendall Jenner wears a bag, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1775.12s)]
*  all of a sudden all these girls want to wear the bag. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1778.12s)]
*  When they eat at this restaurant, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1780.12s)]
*  all of a sudden all these girls want to go check it out. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1781.12s)]
*  So to Alex's point, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1783.12s)]
*  if some of them are being paid to go to restaurants, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1785.12s)]
*  how can we trust them as an influencer? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1788.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1791.12s)]
*  Because the whole game is to just say, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1792.12s)]
*  to assume that they really truly are inspired [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1794.1999999999998s)]
*  by this restaurant and they love the cuisine. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're selling, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1799.1999999999998s)]
*  if you're a big influencer, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1800.1999999999998s)]
*  you're selling all sorts of products, right? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1801.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, like... [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1803.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh, they're getting... [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1804.1999999999998s)]
*  Huge amounts of money. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1805.1999999999998s)]
*  And they're getting money to even go to restaurants? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1807.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we don't pay anyone to go to restaurants, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1810.1999999999998s)]
*  but I'm sure that that's a business, right? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1812.1999999999998s)]
*  That's got to be a line item in advertising somewhere. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1814.1999999999998s)]
*  In this local town, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1816.1999999999998s)]
*  so-and-so is a huge influencer. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1818.1999999999998s)]
*  They're definitely going to move the needle. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1820.1999999999998s)]
*  They're definitely going to move the needle. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  I thought you guys were making great headlines [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1822.28s)]
*  the opposite way. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1826.28s)]
*  So instead of who comes to the restaurant, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1827.28s)]
*  it was who gets kicked out of or gets rejected. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1830.28s)]
*  Every time a famous person would get rejected at Carbone, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1834.28s)]
*  it was like, P6. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1837.28s)]
*  Dude, but you heard about it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1839.28s)]
*  It happened every now and again, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1841.28s)]
*  and sometimes it was a mistake. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1842.28s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1843.28s)]
*  But it was like Justin Bieber tries to get it... [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1844.28s)]
*  That was a mistake, Justin. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1846.28s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1847.28s)]
*  Milk that mistake. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1848.28s)]
*  Milk that mistake. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1849.28s)]
*  It was unintentional. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1850.28s)]
*  It was unintentional. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1851.36s)]
*  I would not have kicked Justin out. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1852.36s)]
*  A serendipitous mistake or whatever the word is like. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1853.36s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is a mistake, but it only makes sense. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1855.36s)]
*  No, because I didn't want to deal with that press. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1857.36s)]
*  It didn't look good. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1858.36s)]
*  To me, it didn't look good. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1860.36s)]
*  That's not hospitable. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1862.36s)]
*  We tried to take care of it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1863.36s)]
*  It was just like a last-minute thing. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1864.36s)]
*  That scenario was just like a super last-minute [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1866.36s)]
*  trying to make a reservation, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1869.36s)]
*  and they were already showing up, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1870.36s)]
*  but we just didn't have the table at that moment. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1871.36s)]
*  But to Andrew's point, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1873.36s)]
*  there's human psychology. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1874.36s)]
*  When you read, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1875.36s)]
*  this person couldn't get into this restaurant. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1876.36s)]
*  It must be insane. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1877.36s)]
*  It was fire. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1878.36s)]
*  So could you see a world? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1879.36s)]
*  I'm not saying you did it. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1880.4399999999998s)]
*  Could you see a world [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1881.4399999999998s)]
*  where somebody might reject that person [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1882.4399999999998s)]
*  and then leak it to the press? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1883.4399999999998s)]
*  I think it's too risky. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1885.4399999999998s)]
*  I can't see somebody trying that. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1887.4399999999998s)]
*  What's the scummiest thing [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1889.4399999999998s)]
*  you've seen a restaurant do for PR? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1890.4399999999998s)]
*  Scummiest thing to do for PR? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1894.4399999999998s)]
*  There's only so many things that you can really do. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1900.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm trying to think of like creative scummy things. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1903.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, planting paparazzi. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1910.4399999999998s)]
*  So making the calls at the PR agency. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1913.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, someone's there, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1914.4399999999998s)]
*  and then you call like a page six type guy [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1915.4399999999998s)]
*  and all of a sudden they get blown up. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1918.4399999999998s)]
*  I've heard some clothing like, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1921.4399999999998s)]
*  wardrobe people will do that [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1922.4399999999998s)]
*  where they'll like go to some company. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1924.4399999999998s)]
*  Hey, you have this designer clothes? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1925.4399999999998s)]
*  Pay me. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1927.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll make sure he wears it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1928.4399999999998s)]
*  And then when he wears it, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1929.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll call the paparazzi and say, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1930.4399999999998s)]
*  hey, Justin Bieber is at this restaurant. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1931.4399999999998s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1932.4399999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1934.4399999999998s)]
*  And how do you make sure your staff doesn't do that [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1935.4399999999998s)]
*  and then get hit? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1937.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, our staff, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1938.52s)]
*  that's something we talk about more than probably most [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1939.52s)]
*  is sort of anonymity. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1941.52s)]
*  Like one, of course, we say nothing, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1942.52s)]
*  but also like we are, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1945.52s)]
*  we're the protective layer of a celebrity or an athlete [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1948.52s)]
*  or someone that's in the restaurant [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1952.52s)]
*  because you don't know who might be like secretly filming them [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1954.52s)]
*  or who might just come up [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1957.52s)]
*  and try to get like an autograph or a selfie. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1958.52s)]
*  Like, so my team is that last line of defense [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1960.52s)]
*  to make sure that they have a really private moment. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1964.52s)]
*  Do they have a special seating area, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1966.6s)]
*  a special entrance, all of that? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1967.6s)]
*  It depends on the restaurant. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1969.6s)]
*  Some places just have like, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1970.6s)]
*  there's nowhere else to go. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1971.6s)]
*  It depends on how much notice we have, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1974.6s)]
*  but like most places there's like... [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1976.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1978.6s)]
*  Okay, take me through early days. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1979.6s)]
*  Was there a point in Carbone where you were like, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1981.6s)]
*  we're not going to make it, we're going to close? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1983.6s)]
*  Well, early days was just a couple hundred feet away [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1984.6s)]
*  from here, it was original Terese. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1986.6s)]
*  This is on Mulberry, right? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1988.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's the first, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1989.6s)]
*  that's the very first restaurant, Mulberry and Prince. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1990.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, if we're going to go early days, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1992.6s)]
*  literally the first restaurant in the world, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1993.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, if we're going to go early days, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1994.6799999999998s)]
*  let's go really far back. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1995.6799999999998s)]
*  You go work at Baloot, right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=1997.6799999999998s)]
*  I worked at Baloot before, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2000.6799999999998s)]
*  my first like real New York chef was my father, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2002.6799999999998s)]
*  was Babo, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2004.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so you start with Petali, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2005.6799999999998s)]
*  then you go to Italy, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2006.6799999999998s)]
*  You come back and you work for Daniel Baloot. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2008.6799999999998s)]
*  And you're working at Daniel? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2010.6799999999998s)]
*  I went to Daniel to try to get a job. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, the story of Daniel was, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2016.6799999999998s)]
*  I really wanted to work there. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2018.6799999999998s)]
*  My dad was turning 50 years old, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2020.76s)]
*  and I said, pops, I'm going to, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2024.76s)]
*  I saved up some money, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2025.76s)]
*  I'm going to take you to a nice restaurant tonight. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2026.76s)]
*  And me and my dad went to Daniel. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2027.76s)]
*  I know that Daniel kind of works the dining room. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2029.76s)]
*  He walks around the whole dining room, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2031.76s)]
*  and I really wanted to meet him, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2033.76s)]
*  I wanted to get a restaurant. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2034.76s)]
*  So I had my resume in my jacket pocket. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2035.76s)]
*  And he comes over, he introduces himself, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2037.76s)]
*  he talks to her for a second, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2038.76s)]
*  and he asked me what I did. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2039.76s)]
*  I said, listen, I'm a cook in New York, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2040.76s)]
*  but I'd love to work here. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2041.76s)]
*  And I gave my resume right on the dining room floor. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2043.76s)]
*  And he told me, listen, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2045.76s)]
*  I don't know if we have anything, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2046.76s)]
*  but here, call my assistant tomorrow, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2047.76s)]
*  and I called this assistant every day for a month [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2049.84s)]
*  until finally she was like, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2051.84s)]
*  just show up on Saturday. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2052.84s)]
*  Saturday I show up, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2054.84s)]
*  no one knows I'm supposed to be there, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2055.84s)]
*  no one has any idea I'm there. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2056.84s)]
*  I get there, they're like, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2058.84s)]
*  who are you? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2059.84s)]
*  They give me, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2060.84s)]
*  they just throw a uniform at me, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2061.84s)]
*  and they're just like, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2062.84s)]
*  go find something to do. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2063.84s)]
*  So I find one cook, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2064.84s)]
*  I do one thing all day, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2066.84s)]
*  I dice leeks. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2067.84s)]
*  I did that really bad for a while, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2068.84s)]
*  and they kept yelling at me, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2070.84s)]
*  and I finally did it okay. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2071.84s)]
*  I dice leeks all day, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2073.84s)]
*  no one says anything to me. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2074.84s)]
*  The day ends, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2075.84s)]
*  and everyone's going home, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2076.84s)]
*  and I'm like, all right. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2077.84s)]
*  So I throw my uniform in the bin, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2078.92s)]
*  and I'm like, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2079.92s)]
*  I guess no one's going to talk to me today. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2080.92s)]
*  The next day I show up, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2081.92s)]
*  I find the guy, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2082.92s)]
*  I get the leeks again, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2083.92s)]
*  and I do it again. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2084.92s)]
*  No one really talks to me. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2085.92s)]
*  This goes on for like three or four days. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2086.92s)]
*  And then the executive chef at the time, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2088.92s)]
*  a terrifying man named Alex Lee, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2089.92s)]
*  one night during dinner service, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2092.92s)]

*  my name is Mario Carbone, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2103.92s)]
*  I've been here for five days, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2104.92s)]
*  no one's talked to me, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2105.92s)]
*  I've been cutting leeks for four days, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2107.0s)]
*  I just need a job. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2108.0s)]
*  And he's like, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2109.0s)]
*  there's no work here for you, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2110.0s)]
*  there's no jobs here. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2111.0s)]
*  I'm totally full. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2112.0s)]
*  He's like, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2113.0s)]
*  go to one of the other restaurants [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2114.0s)]
*  in the company tomorrow [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2115.0s)]
*  and see if there's a job there. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2116.0s)]
*  So I spent a week at Danielle [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2117.0s)]
*  without really talking to me. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2118.0s)]
*  I wound up getting a job [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2119.0s)]
*  at one of the other restaurants, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2120.0s)]
*  and I worked there for... [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2121.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2122.0s)]
*  Cafe Ballout. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2123.0s)]
*  Ballout, okay. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2124.0s)]
*  So it was, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2125.0s)]
*  at that time, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2126.0s)]
*  I was like 22. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2127.0s)]
*  Me, David Chang, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2128.0s)]
*  owns Mobile Food Group. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2129.0s)]
*  That's what I was about to say. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2130.0s)]
*  This is a really, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2131.0s)]
*  and then also, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2132.0s)]
*  Terese, right? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2133.0s)]
*  My partner Rich, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2134.0s)]
*  we were like in a row like this. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2135.08s)]
*  So think about this, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2136.08s)]
*  within Ballout, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2137.08s)]
*  it's called Cafe Ballout, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2138.08s)]
*  where was it? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2139.08s)]
*  76th and Madison. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2140.08s)]
*  Okay, so within Cafe Ballout, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2141.08s)]
*  three of the four most [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2144.08s)]
*  restaurant tours in New York City [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2146.08s)]
*  would sprout. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2149.08s)]
*  Yeah, 22, 23 years old each. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2150.08s)]
*  21, 22, 23. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2152.08s)]
*  So you know Mova Fuku. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2153.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's fire. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2154.08s)]
*  And wow, this is just so crazy. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2155.08s)]
*  So I'm doing a little research on you [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2158.08s)]
*  and you thought that you would open [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2160.08s)]
*  some of the restaurants [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2162.08s)]
*  that you were in. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2163.08s)]
*  I thought that you would open [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2164.16s)]
*  something with David. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2165.16s)]
*  Originally, we were going to do [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2166.16s)]
*  something together with Dave. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2167.16s)]
*  With Rich as well? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2169.16s)]
*  No, just me and him. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2170.16s)]
*  But Rich was my roommate. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2172.16s)]
*  So we would like, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2174.16s)]
*  after work, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2175.16s)]
*  we would spend like before, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2176.16s)]
*  before we'd crash, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2179.16s)]
*  we'd spend time talking about ideas, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2180.16s)]
*  talking about how we were going to get started, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2182.16s)]
*  what his place was going to be like, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2185.16s)]
*  what my place was going to be like. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2186.16s)]
*  And then in 2008, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2187.16s)]
*  there was a financial crisis [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2190.16s)]
*  and all money dries up. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2191.16s)]
*  All investors dry up. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2193.24s)]
*  Everyone's done. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2194.24s)]
*  But we were ready. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2196.24s)]
*  It was like, this is our time. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2197.24s)]
*  So instead of trying these separate ideas [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2199.24s)]
*  individually, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2204.24s)]
*  we were like, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2205.24s)]
*  if we want to be our own boss next year, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2206.24s)]
*  the only way we're going to do this [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2209.24s)]
*  is if we do it together. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2210.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2211.24s)]
*  And we pooled our resources, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2212.24s)]
*  our money, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2213.24s)]
*  and we took a space a couple hundred feet away [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2214.24s)]
*  that was like 450 square foot jean shop. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2217.24s)]
*  And it was on Mulberry and Prince, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2220.24s)]
*  but we just, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  we thought that that was it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2222.3199999999997s)]
*  We thought that was the energy, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2223.3199999999997s)]
*  that was the spot [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2224.3199999999997s)]
*  and that's where we needed to be. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2225.3199999999997s)]
*  And that was [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2226.3199999999997s)]
*  Therese, what was it called? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2227.3199999999997s)]
*  Therese Italian Specialties. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2228.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Therese Italian Specialties. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2229.3199999999997s)]
*  So he got his name first. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2231.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2233.3199999999997s)]
*  Eagle maniac, this guy. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2234.3199999999997s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2236.3199999999997s)]
*  Foosball, two out of three. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2237.3199999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2239.3199999999997s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2242.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2243.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the most diplomatic way to do it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2244.3199999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2246.3199999999997s)]
*  How else would you do it? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2247.3199999999997s)]
*  Rock, paper, scissors, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2248.3199999999997s)]
*  but that's too much to chance. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2249.3199999999997s)]
*  Not two Italian kids, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2250.4s)]
*  you play football. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2251.4s)]
*  So Rich gets his name. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2253.4s)]
*  Is it successful? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2255.4s)]
*  At first, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2257.4s)]
*  at first it was mixed. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2259.4s)]
*  We opened it as a sandwich shop. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2261.4s)]
*  That did well, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2264.4s)]
*  but our goal was to open it at night [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2266.4s)]
*  and do like kind of a serious dinner. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2267.4s)]
*  It was one set menu on a chalkboard. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2271.4s)]
*  And when we started opening at night, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2274.4s)]
*  no one really came. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2276.4s)]
*  And if they did come, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2277.4s)]
*  they were like, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2278.4s)]
*  I heard you sell sandwiches. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2279.48s)]
*  And we're like, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2280.48s)]
*  yeah, but in the daytime, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2281.48s)]
*  like, yeah, but there's nobody here [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2282.48s)]
*  making a sandwich. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2283.48s)]
*  You're like, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2284.48s)]
*  no, that's not the thing. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2285.48s)]
*  That's not what we're doing. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2286.48s)]
*  We're doing this menu thing. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2287.48s)]
*  That took a while. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2290.48s)]
*  They got an appointment down the road. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2292.48s)]
*  You want the money or not? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2294.48s)]
*  I see what you're saying, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2295.48s)]
*  but I'm going to die on my morals here. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2296.48s)]
*  It took a while for people to figure out [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2299.48s)]
*  what was going on there. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2301.48s)]
*  What do you think it was? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2304.48s)]
*  Eventually, we got a great review [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2305.48s)]
*  from New York Magazine [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2307.48s)]
*  and that started, you know, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2308.56s)]
*  a bit of a line outside. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2310.56s)]
*  People waiting for reservations. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2312.56s)]
*  The shit that we had never seen before. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2313.56s)]
*  Almost overnight. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2315.56s)]
*  Were you just waiting on the reservation? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2316.56s)]
*  Were you calling them, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2317.56s)]
*  trying to get them down? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2318.56s)]
*  Because I think you know, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2319.56s)]
*  this could change fortunes. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2320.56s)]
*  Anybody reviewing us, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2321.56s)]
*  how do you get them to review you? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2322.56s)]
*  We had, you don't, right? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2323.56s)]
*  You don't. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2324.56s)]
*  And at first, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2325.56s)]
*  when they came the first time, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2326.56s)]
*  they were alone in the dining room. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2327.56s)]
*  We knew them. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2329.56s)]
*  And so we cooked for them. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2330.56s)]
*  We talked to them. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2333.56s)]
*  We were friendly. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2334.56s)]
*  They left. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2335.56s)]
*  They came back next week [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2336.56s)]
*  and they were like, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2337.64s)]
*  Rich, man, they must really like it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2338.64s)]
*  They're here again. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2339.64s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, cool. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2340.64s)]
*  You know, whatever. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2341.64s)]
*  Third time they come and I'm like, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2342.64s)]
*  oh, they're making sure. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2343.64s)]
*  Oh, they're writing a review on this restaurant. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2345.64s)]
*  So do you spice it up on that last one? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2348.64s)]
*  I mean, we gave it all we had. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2351.64s)]
*  But it wasn't, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2352.64s)]
*  I mean, we threw everything we had at it, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2353.64s)]
*  but it wasn't much at the time. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2354.64s)]
*  We only had this one little menu. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2355.64s)]
*  Yeah, no sandwiches. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2357.64s)]
*  We had no sandwiches. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2358.64s)]
*  Just enough money to kind of make a chalkboard. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2359.64s)]
*  Were you both in the kitchen at that time? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2363.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's only five employees total. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2365.64s)]
*  There's like me, him, a dishwasher, one waitress. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2366.72s)]
*  I mean, that's everybody, right? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2369.72s)]
*  So we were open. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2371.72s)]
*  We're open six days a week. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2372.72s)]
*  On the seventh day, we were closed. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2373.72s)]
*  We were doing prep and everything. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2375.72s)]
*  He and I would go in, lock the door. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2376.72s)]
*  We'd go in. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2378.72s)]
*  We'd crank the radio and we would prep all day just to get ready. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2379.72s)]
*  So we were working seven days, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2383.72s)]
*  but we were the only employees. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2385.72s)]
*  But we were living the dream. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2387.72s)]
*  There's an interesting thing with restaurants specifically [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2388.72s)]
*  about the review. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2391.72s)]
*  And this has changed in almost every other form of media. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2392.72s)]
*  The review is really important with TV shows [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2395.7999999999997s)]
*  or not even TV shows, but like movies, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2398.7999999999997s)]
*  anything that comedy that you had to leave the house for, right? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  Because you got to get a babysitter, you get dressed, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2404.7999999999997s)]
*  you get a new, there's like a lot of things you have to do, right? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2407.7999999999997s)]
*  Once everything went streaming, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  the review doesn't really matter. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2411.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you sweating the reviews when the special comes out? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2413.7999999999997s)]
*  No, because all you got to do is turn it on. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2416.7999999999997s)]
*  And people make their own reviews. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2418.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm saying about social media as well. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2420.7999999999997s)]
*  But what specifically with restaurants is [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2422.88s)]
*  you're not ordering a delivery. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2424.88s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2426.88s)]
*  So if I'm going to commit that, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2427.88s)]
*  I have one date night a week with my wife. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2428.88s)]
*  If I'm going to commit Tuesday night to someplace, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2430.88s)]
*  my wife has already vetted 10 different websites [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2432.88s)]
*  and made sure it's a thing that she really wants to do [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2435.88s)]
*  because that's our one night out a week, right? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2437.88s)]
*  So the review does still hold, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2439.88s)]
*  whether the review is from an influencer, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2442.88s)]
*  some social media, from Yelp, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2444.88s)]
*  the review does still hold a lot of weight [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2446.88s)]
*  within the restaurant community. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2449.88s)]
*  We still need that word of mouth. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2451.96s)]
*  We still need someone to validate the experience [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2453.96s)]
*  before we go. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2455.96s)]
*  Whereas just turning on a special is, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2456.96s)]
*  I don't need you to tell me if it's good or not. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2458.96s)]
*  I give it 10 minutes, ah, it sucks, I'm done. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2459.96s)]
*  Oh, I really like it, I'll keep watching it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2461.96s)]
*  So it's interesting to see that one single review flipped. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2463.96s)]
*  I mean, I used to hear that back in the 70s and 80s [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2467.96s)]
*  if you got a great New York Times review [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2470.96s)]
*  that the owners would literally tear it out of the newspaper, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2472.96s)]
*  walk into the bank, and get a loan. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2476.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2478.96s)]
*  And be like, here. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2480.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2481.04s)]
*  That's all you need. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2482.04s)]
*  The old New York Times critics used to tell me that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2483.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2485.04s)]
*  So were they drunk off that power? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2486.04s)]
*  I mean, that was the top. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2488.04s)]
*  I mean, there was no Michelin in America back then. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2490.04s)]
*  Rick Aitken is a little stronger. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2492.04s)]
*  Yes, chef. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2494.04s)]
*  What, a little, a little? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2495.04s)]
*  Like a little dirty martini. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2496.04s)]
*  Dirty martini. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2497.04s)]
*  Ooh, wait a minute. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2498.04s)]
*  Gin? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2499.04s)]
*  Or vodka. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2500.04s)]
*  Right away. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2501.04s)]
*  I'll do that as well. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2502.04s)]
*  This guy just brought you a spritz, you dick. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2503.04s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna have that too. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2505.04s)]
*  Acting glasses make me nervous, it's why I burped. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2506.04s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you bring it, you know what I mean? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2508.12s)]
*  Two vodka martinis, right away. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2510.12s)]
*  Hey, in all of your experience, who's the worst tipper? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2512.12s)]
*  Oh, this is a good question. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2515.12s)]
*  Everyone tips wonderfully. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2516.12s)]
*  I'm not gonna get him. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2519.12s)]
*  You're not gonna get him. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2521.12s)]
*  Come on. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2522.12s)]
*  Who's the biggest scumbag that walked in there? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2523.12s)]
*  Everyone who walks in the door, we thank them very, very much. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2526.12s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2529.12s)]
*  Everyone's great. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2530.12s)]
*  When you were letting Epstein dine at your section specifically, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2531.12s)]
*  was he a big tipper? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2534.12s)]
*  I don't know nothing. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2536.12s)]
*  I wasn't there that night, I was off there. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2537.2s)]
*  Mr. Faye, if I may ask you to settle in between Alex, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2540.2s)]
*  Alex and me, your life depends on your answer here. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2545.2s)]
*  Alex and I walk into a restaurant, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2547.2s)]
*  who do you think is gonna tip better? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2549.2s)]
*  You don't know anything about us, you're just looking at us. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2551.2s)]
*  You know what, we just deliver the best service, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2554.2s)]
*  as long as you're happy at the end of the day. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2556.2s)]
*  We don't think about things like that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2558.2s)]
*  You're not gonna get him. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2560.2s)]
*  He's looking at you a lot. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2561.2s)]
*  You don't go, oh, we got a customer. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2563.2s)]
*  He's looking at you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2565.2799999999997s)]
*  He is, I'm just saying. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2566.2799999999997s)]
*  Three martinis? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2568.2799999999997s)]
*  Three martinis. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  Make it four. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2570.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you call them? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2571.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you call them Canadians? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2572.2799999999997s)]

*  Three martinis on the way. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2576.2799999999997s)]
*  Make it four. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2577.2799999999997s)]
*  Four, you got it. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2578.2799999999997s)]
*  See how demanding they are? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2579.2799999999997s)]
*  Italians count, they can't even help the Italian, bro. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2582.2799999999997s)]
*  He said three, three like that. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  I love it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2586.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, so, all right, so the review changes everything, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2588.2799999999997s)]
*  but it's still a small restaurant. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2591.2799999999997s)]
*  You're not getting... [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2592.36s)]
*  Can you answer that question? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2593.36s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2595.36s)]
*  Tips the worst. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2596.36s)]
*  Who does tip the worst? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2597.36s)]
*  Indians or black people? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2598.36s)]
*  That's not fair. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2600.36s)]
*  That's not fair. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2601.36s)]
*  But he does have an answer. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2602.36s)]
*  Chinese. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2603.36s)]
*  No, but they're Chinese tips. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2604.36s)]
*  Like Diner Boy in New York City. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2605.36s)]
*  I'm a Diner Boy. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2607.36s)]
*  I'm a Diner Boy. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2608.36s)]
*  Who tips the word? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2609.36s)]
*  I was talking... [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2610.36s)]
*  My dad told me, my dad told me, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2611.36s)]
*  you didn't need a tip when you said at the bar. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2613.36s)]
*  See, and I overcommit. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2619.36s)]
*  And I overcompensate, I over tip because of the... [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2621.44s)]
*  Because that's a great scene in My Blue Heaven [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2624.44s)]
*  with Steve Martin goes over, over tipping [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2626.44s)]
*  by the fantastic movie. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2630.44s)]
*  Is there a version where over tipping [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2632.44s)]
*  makes you look a little funny? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2634.44s)]
*  No. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2636.44s)]
*  Never at all? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2637.44s)]
*  No. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2638.44s)]
*  But do you think if you saw him over tip or him over tip, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2639.44s)]
*  they would be overcompensating for cultural scarcity? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2641.44s)]
*  If I over tip, I'm generous. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2644.44s)]
*  If they over tip, they're trying to make up for [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2645.44s)]
*  what their people have done to the restaurant industry for decades. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2647.44s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2649.52s)]
*  I'm simply taking care of the staff. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2650.52s)]
*  I actually think this is... [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2652.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not even... [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2654.52s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2655.52s)]
*  I don't got any pushback on that. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2656.52s)]
*  That's been around Ricky for a while. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2657.52s)]
*  Also, 20% is fine, right? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2658.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2660.52s)]
*  20% is generous. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2661.52s)]
*  15%? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2662.52s)]
*  Oh, this is... [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2663.52s)]
*  Wait, 20% is generous, 15% I can't do... [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2664.52s)]
*  Were you unhappy with your service? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2666.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2667.52s)]
*  No, I thought it was great. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2668.52s)]
*  I mean, yes. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2669.52s)]
*  So yeah, what should you tip 20%? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2670.52s)]
*  20%. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2673.52s)]
*  20% is good. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2674.52s)]
*  You're good at 20. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2675.52s)]
*  20 is right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2676.52s)]
*  25. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2677.52s)]
*  I would only go under 20 if I was unhappy with my service. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2678.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2681.6s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2682.6s)]
*  That's typically what I do. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2683.6s)]
*  But if you are unhappy... [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2684.6s)]
*  He's always unhappy. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2685.6s)]
*  He's always unhappy. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2686.6s)]
*  He's never happy. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2687.6s)]
*  You might want to start staying home. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2688.6s)]
*  No, I started tipping better when I started making money. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2691.6s)]
*  When I didn't have money, I would look for any excuse [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2695.6s)]
*  that you gave me bad service so I could go 15. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2698.6s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't like his attitude and I didn't like his vibe. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2700.6s)]
*  15 is so hard to calculate. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2703.6s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2704.6s)]
*  You getting your phone out? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2705.6s)]
*  I'm Indian. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2706.6s)]
*  You know what it is my dad taught me? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2707.68s)]
*  It's double the tax. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2708.68s)]
*  Back in the day, double the tax... [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2709.68s)]
*  You're 16. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2710.68s)]
*  You've got to go a little lower than that. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2711.68s)]
*  He doubles and it takes a little longer. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2712.68s)]
*  I'm 41. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2715.68s)]
*  Back in the day, double the tax was a fine tip. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2716.68s)]
*  20% is like a newer thing. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2719.68s)]
*  When we were younger, 15 used to be... [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2720.68s)]
*  That's inflation. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2722.68s)]
*  15 used to be... [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2723.68s)]
*  That used to be the good spot. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2724.68s)]
*  But now you're tipping for all sorts of things that don't warrant any sort of tips. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2725.68s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2728.68s)]
*  Like what? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2729.68s)]
*  I mean, if you're just going to the coffee shop, you're getting a cup of coffee, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2730.68s)]
*  all of a sudden the screen spins around. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2732.68s)]
*  He made me tip. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2733.68s)]
*  I didn't use the tip. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2734.68s)]
*  I got a water in it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2735.68s)]
*  15, 20, or 25. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2736.7599999999998s)]
*  I got a water at a cafe today. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2737.7599999999998s)]
*  Just the water. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2738.7599999999998s)]
*  I brought the water. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  She made me... [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2740.7599999999998s)]
*  Spin that screen around. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2741.7599999999998s)]
*  She made me beep it. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  Son, son, son. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2743.7599999999998s)]
*  And then turn the thing around and then the thing said 20%. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, what did you do in this whole process? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2747.56s)]
*  The screen is going to prompt you to a couple of questions. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  Buddy, self-checkout at the airport. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2752.2s)]
*  They ask if you want to leave a tip. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2753.8399999999997s)]
*  No one is here. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2755.0s)]
*  I still take money off my job. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2756.0s)]
*  I still take money off the airport because people are working those... [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2757.0s)]
*  Just making sure you don't steal. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2759.12s)]
*  They understand that you're going to have trouble with this. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2760.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2763.52s)]
*  And there's people that are helping you check out. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2764.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2765.52s)]
*  It's bothering me so much. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2767.36s)]
*  If they don't help me check out and I have issues, I just walk out with the water. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2768.36s)]
*  And I know I'm brown. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2771.36s)]
*  And I do it anyway. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2772.36s)]
*  You justify stealing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2773.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2774.36s)]
*  I do it anyway. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2775.36s)]
*  It's a $20 water. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2776.36s)]
*  I get it. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2777.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's $9. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2778.36s)]
*  We ought to get these migrants out to country. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2779.36s)]
*  For real. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2780.36s)]
*  For real. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2781.36s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2782.36s)]
*  And leave the water on the way out. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2783.36s)]
*  Hey, can I ask you, this is a restaurant deep cut. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2784.36s)]
*  What are you going to do with this shit about the migrants? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2787.24s)]
*  No, no. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2789.44s)]
*  For real. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2790.44s)]
*  No, no. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2791.44s)]
*  But no, this is... [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2792.44s)]
*  I've noticed some restaurants... [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2793.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2794.44s)]
*  It's almost as if they made a decision to not have Latino busboys and they go Indian. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2795.76s)]
*  Bangladeshi, I think. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2804.2000000000003s)]
*  Or Bangladeshi. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2805.52s)]
*  I'm going to say it and then we'll bleep it out so that you're safe, but not you're a [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2806.52s)]
*  f***. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2812.04s)]
*  There are no Latinos that work there. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2813.04s)]
*  It's Bangladeshi, you think it is? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2816.32s)]
*  But they're looking at you. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2818.36s)]
*  Is that like a strategic move? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2819.36s)]
*  The strategy that's implemented there is if you have like one main guy who's like the [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2822.16s)]
*  head porter, right? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2826.64s)]
*  He's doing the hiring. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2827.64s)]
*  There's constantly infighting amongst communities. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2830.7999999999997s)]
*  If you start blending communities, there's going to be all sorts of stupid drama that's [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2833.48s)]
*  going to happen because they're fighting with each other. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2840.44s)]
*  And it's best to sort of hire one community of people. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2843.68s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2848.3199999999997s)]
*  I tried to do that way long ago. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2849.32s)]
*  No, that's different. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2851.04s)]
*  What was I talking about? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2852.04s)]
*  That's slavery. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2853.04s)]
*  Oh, it wasn't hiring. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2854.04s)]
*  It wasn't hiring. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2855.04s)]
*  It wasn't hiring. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2856.04s)]
*  What about Matt Turner? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2857.04s)]
*  What about Matt Turner? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2858.04s)]
*  That was the problem. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2859.04s)]
*  If we got a bunch of different ones, there'd be no infighting. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2860.04s)]
*  It's delegation of responsibility. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2873.04s)]
*  I never thought about it like that. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2874.04s)]
*  If your head guy is from this community, he's going to hire... [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2875.44s)]
*  They're going to hire all his people. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2878.2s)]
*  And it's just a happier house, right? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2880.16s)]
*  Everyone gets along. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2881.96s)]
*  It's all one community. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2882.96s)]
*  The staff meal is all the same, right? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2883.96s)]
*  You don't deal with Mexicans making pork for the Muslims and they're fighting about it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2886.0s)]
*  It's just a happier house. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2892.24s)]
*  Is that how it works with nursing too? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2893.72s)]
*  When you see some areas are specifically Filipino, some areas specifically Caribbean. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2896.88s)]
*  I know that happens with nannying. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2901.48s)]
*  If you tap into the Caribbean nanny community, they're going to recommend the other people [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2903.18s)]
*  that are often part of their church. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2907.08s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2908.68s)]
*  I was always word of mouth though for that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2909.68s)]
*  That's what I was assumed it was. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2911.72s)]
*  I could just be like, yeah, I have someone that can fill in. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2912.72s)]
*  I know someone that can pop in. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2915.0s)]
*  But it's all good. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2916.7999999999997s)]
*  They're going to stay within their own squad. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2917.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2919.12s)]
*  People they know. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2920.12s)]
*  Why does it seem like in New York, the best chefs of Italian, the best chefs of Thai, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2921.12s)]
*  and every other cuisine are all Mexican? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2926.7s)]
*  It's teeny tiny. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2929.56s)]
*  Every kitchen I go to, it looks like it's all Hispanics back in the back. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2931.04s)]
*  Oh, you're giving me a little twist. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2935.64s)]
*  Hey, cute. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2937.24s)]

*  He's calling you a fan. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2939.24s)]
*  I think he called me a fan. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2940.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, so wait, you were saying? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2941.24s)]
*  No, just why are all the chefs. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2946.24s)]
*  What are you trying to say is why are Mexicans the best? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2948.24s)]
*  Incredible chefs. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2950.24s)]
*  I mean, Mexican cuisine is arguably the most complex food there is. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2951.24s)]
*  Period. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2955.96s)]
*  Talk that shit. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2956.96s)]
*  Period. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2957.96s)]
*  Starting with like the Aztecs into the Spanish into the regional Mexican cuisine. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2958.96s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2963.6s)]
*  It's an incredibly difficult. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2964.96s)]
*  So if they can cook mole, they can cook whatever else the fuck you want. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2966.6400000000003s)]
*  So then why. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2970.2400000000002s)]
*  And they would work hard. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2971.2400000000002s)]
*  No one asked them about them, pyramids. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2972.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he knows. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2975.2400000000002s)]
*  No one questioned them. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2976.96s)]
*  So with all like the immigration that's going on now, is that affecting the restaurant business [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2978.7200000000003s)]
*  at all? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2983.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure it is. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2984.6800000000003s)]
*  It doesn't affect ours. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2985.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2986.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, we just don't allow like illegal immigrants to work in the restaurants, right? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2987.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, you have to have proper paperwork. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2991.28s)]
*  We don't we don't fuck with that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2994.44s)]
*  Like it's not worth bringing the house down. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2995.88s)]
*  Why are you laughing? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2997.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2998.7999999999997s)]
*  You have to. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=2999.7999999999997s)]
*  I've got five thousand employees. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3000.7999999999997s)]
*  So then how do you get it? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3002.16s)]
*  How do other restaurants get around that? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3003.16s)]
*  Because I see it looks like. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3004.8399999999997s)]
*  You go to Roosevelt Avenue and you get paperwork made. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3006.6s)]
*  Oh, so you can get fake paperwork. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3009.7999999999997s)]
*  I hate to hear that. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3012.3199999999997s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick because Morgan and Morgan is looking [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3015.3199999999997s)]
*  out for the little guy as always. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3018.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, but insurance companies make a big profit by holding on [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3020.52s)]
*  to your money for as long as possible. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3023.72s)]
*  It's what these big guys do. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3025.56s)]
*  The longer they can keep it, they can make interest on it. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3026.56s)]
*  All these little micro interest payments or whatever the fuck. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3028.72s)]
*  It's above my intelligence level, but I know they make a lot of money doing it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3032.3199999999997s)]
*  And after an accident, for that reason, they will do whatever they can to deny and deny [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3035.52s)]
*  and deny, but also delay paying your claim so that profits can keep growing. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3039.7999999999997s)]
*  But Morgan Morgan fights hard for their clients and make sure you get every dollar you deserve. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3043.9599999999996s)]
*  So if you're in court for an accident, someone else's fault, what the insurance company [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3047.7799999999997s)]
*  will do is try to make the jurors think that the guy who made the mistake is the one paying. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3051.32s)]
*  It's actually the insurance company. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3056.32s)]
*  But here's how fucking savvy they are. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3057.76s)]
*  They know a jury is less likely to award or a judge is less likely to award a huge settlement [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3059.4s)]
*  to an individual guy who probably can't pay the money back instead of the insurance company. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3064.44s)]
*  Basically they think of every way to nickel and dime and fuck all of us out of our money. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3069.0400000000004s)]
*  And that's why Morgan Morgan has taken on these cases. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3073.84s)]
*  When Morgan Morgan takes on a case, they are going to go after the big insurance companies, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3076.1600000000003s)]
*  not the individuals at fault. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3079.92s)]
*  They fight hard for their companies. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3081.6800000000003s)]
*  A guy in Pennsylvania just won 29 million. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3082.88s)]
*  The insurers best option was 500,000. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3085.4s)]
*  500,000 to 29 million. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3087.84s)]
*  That's 28.5 million they just did. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3089.36s)]
*  So there's a reason why Morgan Morgan is America's largest injury law firm. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3091.6s)]
*  It's because hiring the wrong law firm can be disastrous and hiring the right law firm [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3095.2400000000002s)]
*  could substantially increase your settlement. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3099.7200000000003s)]
*  With Morgan Morgan, it's easy to get started and their fee is free unless you win. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3101.6s)]
*  I'm always going to say how important that is. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3105.44s)]
*  And a guy who got the extra 28.5 million, he is going to pay out Morgan and Morgan. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3107.3s)]
*  But you know what he would have got without Morgan and Morgan? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3110.6600000000003s)]
*  500,000 dollars. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3113.02s)]

*  Hard dick season. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3136.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3138.54s)]
*  There are four very important seasons in the year. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3139.98s)]
*  If you live in a real place and all those seasons require hard dick for the women and [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3144.54s)]
*  men that you love. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3150.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3151.98s)]
*  And there's one way to guarantee that to a blue shoe, same active ingredients inside [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3152.98s)]
*  Seattle, so Viagra. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3156.8199999999997s)]
*  But this is the shoe. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3158.02s)]
*  This is the one we rock with. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3159.06s)]
*  You're not going to rock with that old antiquated desktop that has 14 different plus. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3160.58s)]
*  That's what those other brands are. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3167.22s)]
*  This is the shoe. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3168.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3169.46s)]
*  This is sleek. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3170.46s)]
*  This is sexy. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3171.46s)]
*  This is chewed up and then all over that girl's back within. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3172.46s)]
*  I mean honestly, I don't even know how fast you want to do. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3176.58s)]
*  You want to do some jumping jacks after you take it. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3178.7799999999997s)]
*  Maybe it's in your bloodstream within minutes. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3180.66s)]
*  I don't know how your body metabolizes things. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3182.66s)]
*  The point I'm trying to make is if you want to make sure that that girl has the best night [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3185.34s)]
*  of her life and she deserves it and you want to get your first month free, all you got [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3189.9s)]
*  to do is pay $5 shipping. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3194.42s)]
*  When you go to Bluetooth.com and use the promo code flagrant, that's really it. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3195.94s)]
*  That's all I have to tell you. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3200.4s)]
*  You have all the information you need. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3201.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3202.94s)]
*  If you want to make that girl's life, you do that. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3203.94s)]
*  If you want to disappoint her, then you don't. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3206.82s)]
*  It's really up to you. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3208.5s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3209.5s)]
*  So how do we go from the restaurant being the sandwich shop in the daytime, getting [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3210.5s)]
*  a little bit of traction with New York Mag to then becoming a staple in the neighborhood? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3213.86s)]
*  Because it's not even that restaurant that becomes Carbone. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3217.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3219.82s)]
*  Teresi. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3220.82s)]
*  So you and Teresi are there, these two Italian guys that understand art, you understand food. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3221.82s)]
*  At what point do you're like, we need a Jew to pay for shit? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3226.38s)]
*  Well we were pretty frugal early on, but we knew that. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3231.7s)]
*  Why did you bring that up? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3234.34s)]
*  We knew we needed help. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3235.34s)]
*  We were just two chefs who were trying to figure out the rest of it. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3238.34s)]
*  How many tables is that first restaurant? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3242.02s)]
*  Sorry, let me take it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3243.34s)]
*  Six. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3244.34s)]
*  Like six tiny little tables. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3245.34s)]
*  And when we got somebody that was noteworthy coming in, it was heavy because the room was [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3247.34s)]
*  this big. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3251.7400000000002s)]
*  Like, Stout would bring a whole thing and he'd sit in the corner and you're like, oh [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3252.7400000000002s)]
*  shit. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3255.7400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3256.7400000000002s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3257.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3258.7400000000002s)]
*  So early days were kind of crazy when we were getting momentum because that was the room. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3259.7400000000002s)]
*  That was everything. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3263.34s)]
*  But when we met Jeff, Jeff was one of the early customers. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3265.3s)]
*  We knew him. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3268.58s)]
*  We had similar friends in the same business. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3269.58s)]
*  And he came in and he quickly kind of identified that we had a chance of being something much [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3273.3399999999997s)]
*  bigger than we are right now. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3278.98s)]
*  And he thought he could bring the rest of it to the table, which we would have learned. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3280.66s)]
*  I believe it would have learned, but it would have taken a while. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3286.5s)]
*  It expedites the process. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3288.5s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3289.5s)]
*  OK, so you both are together and you decide to open up another restaurant. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3290.5s)]
*  Because he won the first game, you get to get your name. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3296.3399999999997s)]
*  The location is phenomenal. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3300.6s)]
*  Like absolutely phenomenal. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3302.9s)]
*  Pure luck, coincidence, incredibly expensive. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3305.86s)]
*  Like for everybody who doesn't know, it's in what would you say? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3309.78s)]
*  It's like a few blocks from the south. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3312.5s)]
*  It's like Thompson between Bleecker and Houston. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3314.02s)]
*  It's your blocks away from Selho. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3316.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was an Italian restaurant. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3318.34s)]
*  Rocco's, right? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3322.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Rocco from the 20s. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3322.7400000000002s)]
*  I think it was a Genovese family, kind of like Stallworth restaurant. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3325.94s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3329.46s)]
*  There were a couple of questionable doors in there that were for them, back courtyards and shit. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3330.26s)]
*  And it finally kind of fell on disrepair. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3335.7000000000003s)]
*  And we found out about it through the guy who owns the space, knew Jeff somehow. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3338.7400000000002s)]
*  And we wind up getting it. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3344.34s)]
*  It was at the time crazy expensive. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3347.06s)]
*  Now it's a great deal. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3348.6600000000003s)]
*  But at the time it was crazy expensive. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3349.38s)]
*  What was the rent? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3350.6600000000003s)]
*  It was like $18,000 a month in 2012, 2013. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3351.7000000000003s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is a first floor retail space with like three windows facing the street. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3355.78s)]
*  Yeah, max. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3363.3s)]
*  So the majority of it is behind. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3364.26s)]
*  Caverns. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3366.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3366.98s)]
*  I mean, 18 grand is an absolutely absurd, no offense here, but like, what are we talking [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3367.46s)]
*  about square footage? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3371.5400000000004s)]
*  This is like. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3372.34s)]
*  I mean, we were paying top dollar back then. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3373.94s)]
*  How many square feet is the space? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3376.1800000000003s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3377.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3378.26s)]
*  It's 85 seats. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3378.82s)]
*  80, 85. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3381.0600000000004s)]
*  It's smaller than this whole studio that we have here. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3381.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3384.42s)]
*  And okay, so you guys started, there's big overhead, but you have somebody that's willing [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3385.06s)]
*  to invest in you guys. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3389.3s)]
*  At what point is it immediate success? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3391.06s)]
*  Is there a review? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3393.38s)]
*  Are there, is there people of fame that are coming? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3394.26s)]
*  When we first opened, there was a big push of who do you think you are sentiment from [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3396.7400000000002s)]
*  sort of the community at large, because we had gone from these kind of lovable guys [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3403.46s)]
*  charging a small amount of money in New York to tuxedos, you know, expensive dishes, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3407.54s)]
*  table side. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3414.66s)]
*  You know, there was a, there was a sentiment of like, don't you know Emilino's down the [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3416.98s)]
*  block? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3420.74s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3421.54s)]
*  What are you trying to do here? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3422.18s)]
*  You know, there was that, especially from the older generation. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3423.46s)]
*  So we had to kind of push through that. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3426.9s)]
*  So you had immediate almost rejection. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3429.14s)]
*  We had, we had, we had a bit of rejection from the, from like the, the, the food community, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3431.14s)]
*  not, not necessarily the patrons, but the journalists, certainly the ones that had [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3437.06s)]
*  been around a while and seen a lot of shit. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3440.5s)]
*  And you were their darlings. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3442.5s)]
*  Because we were acting older. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3443.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3444.98s)]
*  We, we were, we had these, we had guys like him in tuxedos. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3445.48s)]
*  We were, you know, we would put fake ads in newspapers and like Craigslist to hire [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3448.6600000000003s)]
*  old school waiters because I didn't want kids. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3454.26s)]
*  I wanted old. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3456.58s)]
*  So I would, I, I, we created a fake steakhouse for them to respond to because those are the [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3457.3s)]
*  style of restaurants that they want to take jobs in. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3462.7400000000002s)]
*  And so I got old school guys to come in and, and respond to those ads. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3465.86s)]
*  And then I told them what we were doing and put them in tuxedos, play the old music, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3470.34s)]
*  do the old vibe, you know, because everything in 2013, everything was this big. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3474.7400000000002s)]
*  All the food was this big. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3479.86s)]
*  The trend was 20 course tasting menus. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3481.06s)]
*  And we were doing, we were, we were going completely against that grant. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3483.86s)]
*  And to do that in our, in our 30 years old, didn't make any sense to anyone for a minute. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3487.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3493.2200000000003s)]
*  And it took, it took a little bit of time. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3493.54s)]
*  And then we got to the New York Times review. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3495.94s)]
*  We got an incredible New York Times review. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3497.78s)]
*  And that before that, before that, it was the price point that they were frustrated by. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3500.02s)]
*  It was the price. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3503.94s)]
*  It was that we made such a big leap that it caught people off guard. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3504.7400000000002s)]
*  Who are you guys to charge this much money? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3509.54s)]
*  The same person that was applauding me a couple of months ago down the block in that little place [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3511.2200000000003s)]
*  was like, wait a minute, what'd you just do? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3517.78s)]
*  Was that hard for you to deal with? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3520.34s)]
*  Or do you just not care? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3521.46s)]
*  I understand it, bro. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3522.34s)]
*  This is human nature. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3523.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like when you're on the way up, you remind everybody of what their dreams are. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3524.58s)]
*  And then when you believe maybe you get to the top, you remind them of what they might never achieve. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3528.34s)]
*  And it's very hard for humans to support you in that endeavor. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3533.3s)]
*  And yeah, you see this happen in like every single industry. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3536.82s)]
*  You see this happen with athletes. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3540.1000000000004s)]
*  You see it's like this guy's the next Jordan. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3541.38s)]
*  Then he starts playing really well and he ain't Jordan. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3542.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3544.98s)]
*  I thought you said he's the next Jordan. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3545.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3546.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3547.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3547.6200000000003s)]
*  So you guys are living your dream and all of a sudden you get turned on by the community [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3547.86s)]
*  that had really kind of, I don't want to say inflated your egos, but really like pumped up. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3552.5s)]
*  They helped get us. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3556.6600000000003s)]
*  Confidence to try this. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3558.02s)]
*  So was it heartbreaking? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3559.54s)]
*  Because you must believe their reviews of your other restaurant because you're like, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3560.7400000000002s)]
*  wow, finally someone recognizes our talent. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3564.82s)]
*  Then you see the criticism and you're like, well, shit, do I have to believe that as well? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3566.98s)]
*  Those are the same people I believed when they were complimenting me. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3570.58s)]
*  It's very sensitive reviews, right? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3574.1s)]
*  I mean, you put yourself out there, you make this thing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3575.7000000000003s)]
*  So whenever a review doesn't go your way, it's impossible to not take it personally. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3578.58s)]
*  No, I should've heard that. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3584.34s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3584.82s)]
*  100% right. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3585.46s)]
*  So to know that we were putting ourselves out there in that way and to have that be [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3586.1s)]
*  the initial response. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3590.9s)]
*  Again, we were getting traction on the ground. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3592.1s)]
*  People were enjoying themselves. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3594.8199999999997s)]
*  The vibe in the restaurant was good. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3595.94s)]
*  I was just worried a little bit at like the community at large. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3598.02s)]
*  And it took a kind of a flag being planted by the New York Times to say, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3602.58s)]
*  no, this is accredited. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3606.9s)]
*  This belongs. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3608.66s)]
*  So New York Times comes in and thwarts all the other criticism. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3609.7799999999997s)]
*  They basically wait to be the last one. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3614.2599999999998s)]
*  And a big review like that, the New York Times will take that position and they'll [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3617.06s)]
*  wait for New York Magazine and the Post and all the other publications to weigh in. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3621.7799999999997s)]
*  And then they'll go last. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3627.7799999999997s)]
*  And then initially are those other guys saying who the fuck are they? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3628.74s)]
*  Those were a mixed bag. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3631.54s)]
*  They were all over the place. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3633.54s)]
*  Do you remember those people? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3634.66s)]
*  Have you like hung out with them since, seen them since? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3635.7799999999997s)]
*  Have they tried to cozy up to you now that you're successful? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3638.3399999999997s)]
*  I famously threw one out and that was because no one's ever really felt a critic out. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3641.06s)]
*  Wait, what happened? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3646.2599999999998s)]
*  I wasn't again young and a little spicy at the time, but the critic at the time for New York [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3647.62s)]
*  Magazine had come in and he wrote a really poor review and I just didn't like the way he went [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3655.2999999999997s)]
*  about it. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3660.42s)]
*  And I was also young and sensitive and I didn't like the review. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3661.14s)]
*  I didn't like the way he went about it. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3665.54s)]
*  What do you mean you didn't like the way he went about it? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3666.9s)]
*  I remember he brought in like other chefs to sit with him and I didn't think that was cool. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3668.98s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3673.7000000000003s)]
*  To review it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3674.5s)]
*  And I thought he had an agenda. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3675.62s)]
*  I thought he didn't like it from before he even sat down. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3677.38s)]
*  So he was trying to justify it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3680.34s)]
*  He never gave us a chance. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3680.82s)]
*  So he wrote this pretty terrible review and then we had a little bar down the block and he tried [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3682.1800000000003s)]
*  to go to that bar a couple weeks later and he's supposed to be anonymous, but I know who he is, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3688.82s)]
*  and he shows up and we threw him out and that became a whole thing because like [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3693.94s)]
*  no one's ever done that. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3698.26s)]
*  And in hindsight, probably I wouldn't have done it again, but that's how I felt at the time. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3699.46s)]
*  I wonder if the people that review or react to things, I wonder if they understand like [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3705.94s)]
*  the lack of respect for their opinion. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3712.1800000000003s)]
*  We're appreciative when their opinions are complementary, but like the lack of respect [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3714.34s)]
*  comes from the fact that like a lot of them have never put something out in the world [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3719.7000000000003s)]
*  to be criticized. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3724.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, manly arena. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3725.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Teddy Roosevelt. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3726.9s)]
*  And it's like it is a different thing when you create something and you put work into it and [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3728.58s)]
*  then you place it out in the world to be criticized or loved, doesn't matter. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3733.94s)]
*  There is a vulnerability to that. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3737.62s)]
*  So like even the people I don't even like and I don't even like their stuff, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3738.74s)]
*  I still admire that they have the courage to put it out. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3741.7799999999997s)]
*  And I wonder if critics, if they did that initially in their own life, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3744.18s)]
*  if they had submitted something for public hazing or public scrutiny or support, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3750.2599999999998s)]
*  if they would have a different energy towards their criticisms. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3756.34s)]
*  I wish you get one of them on here. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3761.2200000000003s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3762.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3763.78s)]
*  I wonder if they ever think about that. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3765.0600000000004s)]
*  I appreciate the ones that do real homework that come with real like either they've been [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3767.3s)]
*  in the business a really long time, but you can tell that the way they go about it, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3772.26s)]
*  the way that they research it, whether they like it or not, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3775.86s)]
*  it comes from a real place of understanding. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3780.34s)]
*  And at that point, you can't, you can only say so much. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3782.9s)]
*  But the ones that have their opinions made up beforehand. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3786.34s)]
*  Did you ever got a negative review that you respected? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3788.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3791.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I have. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3791.46s)]
*  And what does that look like? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3794.0200000000004s)]
*  You know, there's a couple of critics. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3795.94s)]
*  There's one named Ryan Sutton who is a really, really bright journalist who knows his shit [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3798.6600000000003s)]
*  inside and out. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3805.6200000000003s)]
*  And sometimes he's written really beautiful reviews for us and sometimes he hasn't. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3806.7400000000002s)]
*  And if I look back at the ones that he was more critical of, they are some of the things that [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3811.62s)]
*  they're some of the projects that I think needed more work than others. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3818.98s)]
*  I think he was probably right about them. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3822.42s)]
*  Respect. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3824.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3825.14s)]
*  That simple. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3825.46s)]
*  I had a guy criticize a joke that or he criticized writing as lazy and then he [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3826.74s)]
*  referenced a joke that he didn't get. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3835.7s)]
*  So in his criticism, he missed the cleverness of the joke, but he had such confidence to [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3838.58s)]
*  criticize me that he showcased the joke as evidence for like laziness while the joke [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3845.62s)]
*  went over his head. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3851.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't even know what to do in that. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3852.8199999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3855.62s)]
*  What do you do with that? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3856.5s)]
*  I mean, like, how do you compartmentalize that? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3857.22s)]
*  I mean, at this point, I'm just like, yeah, I have to give more. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3859.22s)]
*  I have to give more energy to the people that really praise and really appreciate and like [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3863.22s)]
*  more aligned with like what I think the creative vision is. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3866.98s)]
*  Comics are dope because just like chefs, they get instant gratification. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3870.42s)]
*  You tell a joke and you know, you know right away, like I deliver the plate and it's gone. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3873.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3877.8599999999997s)]
*  Did you like it or not? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3878.18s)]
*  You ate it or no. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3878.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3879.7799999999997s)]
*  Like it's instant gratification. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3879.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3881.46s)]
*  Which is just beautiful. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3882.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3883.7s)]
*  And like it disappears. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3883.94s)]
*  You make something. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3885.8599999999997s)]
*  It's a disappearing art. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3886.98s)]
*  It goes on a plate and it's consumed and it's gone. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3888.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3890.1s)]
*  I'm curious when you create Carbone and you go for like these, you know, old school, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3891.24s)]
*  you know, servers, captains faces, all these guys, where does that vision come from? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3895.4s)]
*  Are you trying to replicate something that, you know, you went to as a kid [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3899.48s)]
*  or were you just trying to deviate from the trend that was happening presently? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3902.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, where did that conviction happen? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3905.4s)]
*  Carbone was a very intentional sort of celebration. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3907.56s)]
*  It's an Italian American restaurant, right? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3913.64s)]
*  So it immediately doesn't exist in the country of Italy. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3915.24s)]
*  It's born and raised in America like I am. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3919.64s)]
*  So if you start to look at it and you're telling a story, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3922.3599999999997s)]
*  and for me, restaurants are most closely, most closely similar to theater. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3925.64s)]
*  You build a stage, you're telling a story, you're in costume, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3931.56s)]
*  you're trying to make this believable play that starts at the exact same time every day [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3936.12s)]
*  with the same cast in same uniform for a different audience. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3941.0s)]
*  It's theater. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3945.64s)]
*  And you're trying to create something that's transportive. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3946.76s)]
*  I want to take you somewhere. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3950.92s)]
*  And in Carbone's perspective, it's first generation Italian Americans. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3952.28s)]
*  So I say it's Michael, it's not Vito, right? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3957.32s)]
*  It's Michael. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3961.2400000000002s)]
*  He struggles with Italian, right? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3962.2000000000003s)]
*  In the movie, right? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3963.96s)]
*  He can speak it a little bit, but it's not his native tongue. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3965.0800000000004s)]
*  He's born in New York, right? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3967.96s)]
*  This is a thing that's born in New York. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3969.48s)]
*  It's really not recognized. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3971.0s)]
*  It's not understood by Italians. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3972.44s)]
*  It's our thing. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3974.1200000000003s)]
*  So when did that take place? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3975.7200000000003s)]
*  If you think about the Godfather movie, the first reference is [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3977.48s)]
*  Louis' Italian American restaurant where he kills Salazzo. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3980.12s)]
*  That's the 40s and 50s. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3983.08s)]
*  So that's where I wanted to set the restaurant to that period. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3984.76s)]
*  So then I started thinking about, okay, if it's 1950 New York, what's the music? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3987.48s)]
*  What's the uniform? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3992.76s)]
*  What's the menu look like? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3993.64s)]
*  What's the server look like? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3995.88s)]
*  What is this? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3997.0s)]
*  Because I want you, the customer, to walk into it and teleport and be in my play. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=3998.44s)]
*  I always appreciate thoughtfulness. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4003.4s)]
*  Whether I, whatever, if I know you were being very thoughtful in what you did, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4005.88s)]
*  I just really appreciate that. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4010.04s)]
*  And I love that. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4011.64s)]
*  And my question kind of piggyback on what Marcus said. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4012.52s)]
*  You had a vision, Rich had a vision. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4014.6800000000003s)]
*  Y'all were going to do separate things, but then you came together. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4016.76s)]
*  What elements did you take from each of yourselves to create Carbone, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4019.7200000000003s)]
*  Terese, whatever it was? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4022.76s)]
*  He's crazy talented. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4023.96s)]
*  He's a better chef than I am, right? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4025.88s)]
*  We're both chefs, but he's... [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4027.48s)]
*  Better foosball player. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4028.84s)]
*  He's a better fucking foosball player. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4029.64s)]
*  Super talented, militant about how he goes about things. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4032.68s)]
*  I'm much more... [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4038.2s)]
*  I live in the margins, right? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4039.56s)]
*  I tell these sort of stories. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4043.0s)]
*  They don't necessarily... [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4045.72s)]
*  There's a perfection to the imperfection for me. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4046.9199999999996s)]
*  While he's more like a Swiss watch. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4050.52s)]
*  He's been trained by the best chefs in the world. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4053.3199999999997s)]
*  He's an incredible... [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4055.24s)]
*  So I've taken a little bit from him, and I think he's taken a little bit from me, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4056.3599999999997s)]
*  of how we go about making something. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4060.68s)]
*  And that's proven really, really, really special for us, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4063.7999999999997s)]
*  and how the end result gets there. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4068.2s)]
*  Because I think without either one of us, it's a really different product. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4070.6s)]
*  But we approach it really differently. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4075.08s)]
*  And if there's a chef competition, he wipes the floor with me. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4076.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you have to say that because your restaurant is so much more successful? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4081.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4083.8799999999997s)]
*  We love you, Rich! [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4091.0s)]
*  Rich, we love you! [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4092.44s)]
*  We need a reservation at 8, not 5.30. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4093.56s)]
*  Not 10 p.m. and not at the bar. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4097.0s)]
*  And not at that new seating that you put in front of the kitchen. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4098.92s)]
*  Okay, so obviously Carbone, it becomes super successful. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4105.5599999999995s)]
*  How much is the game nurturing relationships with famous people [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4109.72s)]
*  because of what they bring to the success of the restaurant? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4115.88s)]
*  I.e. Jay-Z coming into the restaurant, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4119.4800000000005s)]
*  Justin Bieber getting rejected and humiliated outside of it. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4122.76s)]
*  But how much is it like you nurturing those relationships? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4126.6s)]
*  I always say that it's really flattering when they come [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4130.28s)]
*  because they can call anybody, right? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4132.76s)]
*  There's no door that's not going to take Jay. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4135.24s)]
*  So the fact that he came tonight means that he's selected there, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4137.88s)]
*  he's chosen to go there. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4141.56s)]
*  So I think it's really flattering when we do get these sort of big celebrities and athletes. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4142.6s)]
*  And as far as taking care of them, I think the most important thing is making sure that [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4146.5199999999995s)]
*  you do everything you can as a restaurant, as a team, to protect their privacy. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4150.04s)]
*  You know, they're not there to be on display. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4156.2s)]
*  You want to try to make an environment that's really nurturing for that [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4159.0s)]
*  and make sure that they're protected. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4162.839999999999s)]
*  The team knows that. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4164.2s)]
*  Their anonymity is everything to me. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4166.04s)]
*  And I think if you do that, then they respect it, put out a good product, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4167.719999999999s)]
*  make something they want to come back for. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4171.0s)]
*  And hopefully they'll be part of the regular. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4173.24s)]
*  How does the public find out that all these celebs are going there? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4176.84s)]
*  Everyone's got a phone, too. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4182.2s)]
*  I think it's like, yo, Jay Z was at the restaurant while we were there. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4183.32s)]
*  Have you ever had to throw a patron out [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4186.44s)]
*  because they didn't know how to act around a famous person? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4188.2s)]
*  I don't think we've ever thrown anybody out. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4193.08s)]
*  I think we've definitely gotten in the way of photos, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4194.76s)]
*  hey, I'm sorry, but Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So's having dinner, please respect that. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4198.44s)]
*  I don't think we've ever thrown anybody out. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4203.24s)]
*  Anybody that's banned? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4205.08s)]
*  We have a few banned. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4207.32s)]
*  Who's banned? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4208.2s)]
*  To get... one of the only ways to get banned in this company... [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4210.76s)]
*  You think he's a rat? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4214.84s)]
*  You think he's a fucking rat? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4215.48s)]
*  One of the only ways to get banned in the company is to treat the staff poorly. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4216.76s)]
*  So who treats them the worst? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4220.44s)]
*  If you're a dick to the staff... [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4221.32s)]
*  Give us some shit. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4222.28s)]
*  Rich would tell us. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4223.24s)]
*  Rich would totally tell us. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4225.24s)]
*  So would Zelazny. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4226.36s)]
*  Snitches get stitched. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4227.639999999999s)]
*  So would Zelinsky. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4228.5199999999995s)]
*  Who's the guy that... [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4229.32s)]
*  Zelinsky is the guy that would say thank you. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4233.8s)]
*  Ukrainian? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4236.76s)]
*  No, Zelaznyk. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4237.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4240.2s)]
*  So they would tell us, give us a little dirt. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4241.08s)]
*  Who's a piece of shit to the staff? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4244.04s)]
*  Who should we know about? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4245.72s)]
*  That person deserves to be outed. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4246.2s)]
*  They deserve to be outed. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4247.72s)]
*  Jeff Bezos. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4249.5599999999995s)]
*  No, Bezos is a good guy. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4250.92s)]
*  I heard that he offered to put you in the spaceship with all the girls. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4252.2s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4256.04s)]
*  Yo, I would get so claustrophobic in the spaceship. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4256.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4259.24s)]
*  I had to do... I did the Today Show last week for my... [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4260.04s)]
*  That's your concern. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4262.44s)]
*  From a cruise ship. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4264.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm funny with you. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4265.719999999999s)]
*  I'm like severely claustrophobic. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4266.5199999999995s)]
*  Yo, I can't get into this thing. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4267.96s)]
*  If I was ever trapped in an elevator with any of them for 30 seconds, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4268.839999999999s)]
*  they would never respect me as a man. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4271.719999999999s)]
*  I got an order, right? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4273.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4274.2s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4274.759999999999s)]
*  You're like that. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4275.24s)]
*  Okay, so you're not going to give us any shit. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4276.36s)]
*  Why would someone get banned? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4278.919999999999s)]
*  They're a dick to the staff. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4279.96s)]
*  If you treat the staff poorly, you cuss at them, you get drunk, you yell at them, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4280.919999999999s)]
*  God forbid you put your hands on them. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4286.839999999999s)]
*  How's that happen? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4289.799999999999s)]
*  You're never coming back. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4290.36s)]
*  We have door guys and we have security around. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4292.76s)]
*  The restaurants are too busy and too high profile to not. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4295.64s)]
*  But the fastest way to never come back here is to mistreat the staff. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4298.92s)]
*  And that's part of... I assume... [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4304.92s)]
*  I was thinking the service at your restaurant is really good and I really appreciate... [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4306.36s)]
*  I'm a southern boy, so manners mean a lot. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4309.0s)]
*  Is that part of your 50s aesthetic? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4310.92s)]
*  Every waiter going out of their way to do such a... [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4312.5199999999995s)]
*  It seems like there's a show involved for the waiters. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4314.68s)]
*  I'd like to think they go out of the way because that's their home too. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4316.5199999999995s)]
*  You're disrespecting their home. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4320.280000000001s)]
*  This is where they make their money. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4321.56s)]
*  This is their family too. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4322.6s)]
*  The staff doesn't really turn over. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4324.12s)]
*  They're really close as a... [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4325.64s)]
*  They're a really close knit group. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4327.08s)]
*  Do you train them to do any... [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4328.92s)]
*  It's kind of a show. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4331.08s)]
*  When I went to Carbona, it was like... [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4332.280000000001s)]
*  There's a certain amount of... [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4333.72s)]
*  There's a cadence to how I want... [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4335.4800000000005s)]
*  And we do kind of put it in the book too. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4339.320000000001s)]
*  A cadence to how we talk to tables and how we take an order. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4342.200000000001s)]
*  There's a way that we do it. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4346.04s)]
*  Like Ricky's voice is basically in this book as like how we take an order. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4348.2s)]
*  Because they're captains. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4354.12s)]
*  They're not there to take orders. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4354.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4356.36s)]
*  They're there to guide your experience. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they're there to guide your experience. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4358.36s)]
*  When was the first time Carbone was mentioned in a rap song? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4360.44s)]
*  First rap song I think was Drake. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4364.599999999999s)]
*  I think Drake was the first one to do it. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4370.12s)]
*  I think so. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4374.92s)]
*  And did that blow your mind? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4375.48s)]
*  How do you find out about it? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4376.52s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4377.8s)]
*  Yeah, people just started texting it to me. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4378.52s)]
*  We didn't know it was happening, of course. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4381.0s)]
*  It's crazy, yeah. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4384.84s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4385.56s)]
*  I'll be working out in the gym and some song will come on. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4386.280000000001s)]
*  They'll mention Carbone. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4388.52s)]
*  It's absolutely bananas. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4389.4800000000005s)]
*  Did he hit you up before? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4390.360000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4391.72s)]

*  No one's told me before. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4392.84s)]
*  I mean, it's happened a couple times. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4393.8s)]
*  It was just like the cover of someone's album. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4396.280000000001s)]
*  Someone that's on Roc Nation. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4398.4400000000005s)]
*  They just took an iPhone photo in front of Carbone and that was the cover of their album. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4400.120000000001s)]
*  Did you talk to him since? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4404.68s)]
*  Did you hit Drake up? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4405.72s)]
*  Like, yo, thank you for the shout out. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4406.4400000000005s)]
*  I've never thanked him. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4410.12s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4411.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4411.72s)]
*  Oh, hey, real quick. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4412.04s)]
*  Can we send our flowers? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4413.08s)]
*  Take a break from this episode. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4414.04s)]
*  We got to send our flowers to Volk. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4414.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4416.52s)]
*  Alexander Volkanovsky, 46 years old. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4416.84s)]
*  And one. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4419.400000000001s)]
*  Alexander the Great. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4420.280000000001s)]
*  46. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4421.4800000000005s)]
*  You need 46? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4422.2s)]
*  36. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4422.84s)]
*  Why are you aging him like that? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4424.280000000001s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4425.320000000001s)]
*  I thought he was 46. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4426.04s)]
*  He had a whole rugby career. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4426.92s)]
*  That's actually decent logic. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4428.84s)]
*  I see that. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4430.360000000001s)]
*  I thought I heard 46 and I was like, oh, that makes sense. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4430.84s)]
*  You are bad at math. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4433.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's really embarrassing. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4434.92s)]
*  It's really embarrassing. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4436.12s)]
*  But no, for real, shout out to Volk, man. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4436.92s)]
*  That was an unbelievable fight because that guy, Diego Lopez. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4438.44s)]
*  So that's impressive now that I know he's not 46. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4441.32s)]
*  But it was still really impressive. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4443.4s)]
*  It's still really impressive. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4444.759999999999s)]
*  No, he's a beast, man. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4446.28s)]
*  Yo, that guy, Lopez, was scary as shit. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4447.4s)]
*  Also coming off of, I think, three straight losses and two of them are knockout losses. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4449.4s)]
*  Like, you're out completely. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4453.719999999999s)]
*  And to come back after that was awesome to get clipped during the fight and literally be blind [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4456.2s)]
*  in one eye. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4461.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4461.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you guys watched the fight, but it was phenomenal. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4463.08s)]
*  It was fantastic. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4465.48s)]
*  Like, he was just... [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4466.2s)]
*  He was like unbelievable. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4467.16s)]
*  Doesn't stop moving the entire fight, constantly making Lopez. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4468.599999999999s)]
*  And Lopez, give credit to him too. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4472.2s)]
*  He just kept coming forward. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4474.599999999999s)]
*  Dog, his chin is nuts. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4475.8s)]
*  That motherfucker is a beast. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4477.4s)]
*  He's going to be around for a while. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4478.679999999999s)]
*  It was just awesome to see. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4481.5599999999995s)]
*  But it is awesome. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4482.92s)]
*  That's very much a casual... [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4483.72s)]
*  I'm watching this fight and I'm like, dude, I don't know how Volk, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4485.08s)]
*  I don't know how our boy wins this. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4487.4s)]
*  Because Diego Lopez is big and he seems like he hits fucking crazy hard. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4488.92s)]
*  And even though the reach difference apparently wasn't that big, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4493.56s)]
*  that wasn't that much, he looks so much bigger. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4496.28s)]
*  That's the thing, Volk is small, but he's got a 72 inch reach. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4498.4400000000005s)]
*  So your reach is usually kind of your height. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4502.4400000000005s)]
*  So he's a guy, Volk is probably five... [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4505.16s)]
*  Five, six, five, five. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4508.52s)]
*  I think it's 70 inches and that's a guy at 5'10 normally. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4510.76s)]
*  He has a six foot reach. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4513.56s)]
*  Like, that's insane. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4515.88s)]
*  So a lot of these guys, he has that advantage. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4517.32s)]
*  And I think that's why he's able to like... [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4519.24s)]
*  Did you see him peppering him with jazz? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4521.16s)]
*  So you're standing at distance with this guy who's much smaller than you. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4523.64s)]
*  And you're like, there's no way he's in punching distance. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4526.6s)]
*  And then boom, boom, catches you. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4528.4400000000005s)]
*  But there are these moments... [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4530.52s)]
*  And this is the thing that's like about fighting, especially MMA. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4531.8s)]
*  You got basically nothing on your hands. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4535.88s)]
*  So whoever connects, the other person goes down. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4538.04s)]
*  And there are these exchanges where they would both sit down, bite the mouthpiece. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4541.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you saw it, like Volk would come in with a one or slip [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4545.4s)]
*  and then come over the top with a two. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4548.5199999999995s)]
*  And then he'd add three more punches to it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4550.12s)]
*  And in that exchange, they're both throwing. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4552.44s)]
*  And it's not like they have their eyes closed, but you're really just throwing. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4555.24s)]
*  You're assuming the other guy's going to throw and you're like, I hope I land first. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4560.36s)]
*  And we got to watch that for five rounds. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4563.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was a great thing. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4565.4s)]
*  It's an insane thing to witness. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4566.36s)]
*  Anyway, I'm just so happy for him. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4568.92s)]
*  Even if he wants to retire right now, he doesn't have to. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4570.36s)]
*  He has so many more. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4572.599999999999s)]
*  But like... [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4573.32s)]
*  He's a legend. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4573.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, what an accomplishment. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4575.32s)]
*  You did it. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4576.759999999999s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4577.24s)]
*  You know, also to do it in Miami, same place where Izzy came back and took out Pernena. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4577.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're part of the same camp. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4583.48s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of cool vibes there. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4584.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man shouts. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4587.16s)]
*  So, we love you, Volk. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4588.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4589.719999999999s)]
*  Never bet against Volk. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4590.36s)]
*  That's what I said. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4591.16s)]
*  Yeah, last episode. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4591.799999999999s)]
*  He did call that. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4592.679999999999s)]
*  Last episode. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4593.4s)]
*  He did call that. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4593.88s)]
*  Never bet against Volk. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4594.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what I said. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4595.24s)]
*  Volk wins by decision. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4595.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4596.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4597.0s)]
*  You were absolutely right. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4597.48s)]
*  Four round. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4598.44s)]
*  Don't check it, but... [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4599.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4599.96s)]
*  Decision in the first round. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4600.679999999999s)]
*  That's what I said. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4601.639999999999s)]
*  I think he's a second. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4602.36s)]
*  Anyway, what else we got? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4604.28s)]
*  We got NBA playoffs. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4605.88s)]
*  Yeah, this is your time to shine. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4606.92s)]
*  I hope the Mavs lose. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4608.28s)]
*  Oh, Luca came back. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4609.32s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4610.599999999999s)]
*  Luca coming back to Dallas his first game. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4611.32s)]
*  Oh, did you watch it? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4612.759999999999s)]
*  No, I couldn't watch it. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4614.2s)]
*  I'm too sad. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4615.08s)]
*  I'm too broken. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4616.84s)]
*  I'm broken. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4618.04s)]
*  Like, I'm like... [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4618.599999999999s)]
*  I saw the video that they played after... [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4619.4s)]
*  You trade a fucking guy and then play him a... [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4621.639999999999s)]
*  And he doesn't want to leave. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4623.5599999999995s)]
*  Luca starts crying before the game, watching the video. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4624.679999999999s)]
*  This guy did not want to leave Dallas. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4627.96s)]
*  It's the most obvious thing in the world. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4629.32s)]
*  The only thing that made me happy is my friend went to the game and said me... [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4630.92s)]
*  I have it on my phone. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4633.64s)]
*  I can probably pull it up, but the Fire Nico chant in the arena. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4634.2s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4637.32s)]
*  Nico's the GM of the Mavericks. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4637.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4639.400000000001s)]
*  Fire Nico. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4639.88s)]
*  So fucking loud. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4641.08s)]
*  And I'm glad at least... [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4642.84s)]
*  And I think he knows anyway. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4644.04s)]
*  But I'm glad Luca got to see it. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4645.08s)]
*  Like, nobody's... [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4646.28s)]
*  He got a crazy ovation. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4647.08s)]
*  People are cheering to the Lakers. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4648.2s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4649.08s)]
*  There's still a lot of people cheering for the Mavs, like, no matter what. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4649.64s)]
*  But apparently, they're going to lose like $100 million in revenue, they think, from this trade. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4651.8s)]
*  And how is that? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4656.12s)]
*  Ticket pricing? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4657.08s)]
*  Well, they raised ticket prices twice since the trade, which is insane. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4658.68s)]
*  Season ticket prices. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4660.84s)]
*  People aren't renewing. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4661.88s)]
*  I think people aren't buying as much merch now. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4663.4800000000005s)]
*  Who's... [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4665.16s)]
*  I mean, I love Kyrie, but you're not that inclined to buy Kyrie jersey. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4665.56s)]
*  Also, he's injured. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4669.240000000001s)]
*  And he's injured. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4670.12s)]
*  AD, you're probably not. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4671.0s)]
*  Even though he's actually good, he is always hurt. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4672.12s)]
*  And you're always going to look at him as the guy who they traded Luca for. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4674.280000000001s)]
*  So they're never going to really... [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4677.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4678.6s)]
*  So it's just the fucking stupidest trade I've ever seen in my life. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4679.72s)]
*  And then Luca went out for $45 on like 60% shooting. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4684.280000000001s)]
*  He just went nuts. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4687.4s)]
*  And I'm really... [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4688.84s)]
*  This isn't the first time in my life I'm rooting for the Lakers. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4690.28s)]
*  If they won, I'd be so happy for them. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4694.36s)]
*  Poor Akash. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4696.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4697.24s)]
*  You had some good wins early in your life. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4697.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not even worried about you. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4699.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4700.84s)]
*  Since age 10, it's been pretty rough. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4701.48s)]
*  All right. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4702.92s)]
*  So who do we think wins? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4703.08s)]
*  What's happening right here in the NBA playoff picture? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4705.8s)]
*  The West is super tight. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4707.96s)]
*  It's like the Lakers and Wolves, I think, are the 6-3 matchup. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4709.32s)]
*  Can anybody beat the Celtics? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4712.44s)]
*  Ah. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4714.76s)]
*  My understanding is that just from speaking to people around the league, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4716.360000000001s)]
*  it's like... [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4719.64s)]
*  And this is fucked up to even put out there, but the conversation is essentially, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4720.360000000001s)]
*  if everybody's healthy on the Celtics, they're winning it. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4724.52s)]
*  So they're almost hoping... [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4728.360000000001s)]
*  And this is fucked up. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4730.360000000001s)]
*  But they're hoping for an injury because that's the only way it happens. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4731.8s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4735.8s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4736.52s)]
*  But that's how dominant they believe it is. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4737.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4740.6s)]
*  Did the Warriors not make it in? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4741.72s)]
*  No, they won their play. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4743.24s)]
*  They did win their play. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4744.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4745.16s)]
*  So they're seventh. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4746.04s)]
*  I think that's inaccurate. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4747.16s)]
*  They barely beat the Wolves. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4748.12s)]
*  It was a comeback. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4750.84s)]
*  They won by like five in the end. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4751.48s)]
*  Steph, dude, you know what? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4753.08s)]
*  I watched Steph in the Olympics the first time I rooted for him. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4755.0s)]
*  Everything I say about Golden State fans, I've taken back. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4757.96s)]
*  It's the most fun thing in the world. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4760.36s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4761.4s)]
*  It's so fun getting to root for Steph. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4761.96s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I love this guy. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4763.8s)]
*  I take back every negative thing I've ever said about him. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4765.8s)]
*  I think because your team was in the Western Conference, it was harder. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4767.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4771.5599999999995s)]
*  I hated him. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4772.28s)]
*  The fact that we are Knicks fans, you can kind of root. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4772.84s)]
*  I won't say root for West Coast teams, but you're not really tripping off them that much [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4776.68s)]
*  until you reach the finals. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4780.360000000001s)]
*  The Knicks never reach the finals. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4781.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4783.72s)]
*  I'm not really that worried. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4784.2s)]
*  Also, if you're a big LeBron fan, that's the guy that was always in the way. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4785.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4787.96s)]
*  That team was always in the way. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4788.28s)]
*  So LeBron has eight rings if it's not for Steph and the Warriors. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4789.88s)]
*  But I was like, if him and Jimmy Butler went to the finals, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4793.16s)]
*  that'd be the greatest fucking thing. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4797.32s)]
*  And I think they'd give a Celtics hard time. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4798.6s)]
*  This is the thing. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4800.12s)]
*  Jimmy is a different player in the playoffs. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4801.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4803.0s)]
*  Like he went off last night in the play-in. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4803.5599999999995s)]
*  Admittedly so. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4805.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4806.36s)]
*  Like I think I told you this. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4807.0s)]
*  He straight up told me. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4808.36s)]
*  I was like, how many guys can actually step it up to another level in the playoffs? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4809.08s)]
*  And he was like, there's five. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4812.68s)]
*  And he named them. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4813.96s)]
*  And I was like, what's the difference? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4815.32s)]
*  He's like, yeah, during the regular season, it is what it is. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4816.44s)]
*  And then the playoffs is like, we start to really lock in. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4818.92s)]
*  And there's like five guys that can lock in. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4821.88s)]
*  One of those guys he said was Joel Embiid, which I didn't even consider. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4823.8s)]
*  And I was like, really? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4826.76s)]
*  He goes, oh, he goes, that man is not to be played with. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4827.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4830.44s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4830.84s)]
*  Like I've seen him be effective, but maybe because he's kind of slow and plotting. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4833.0s)]
*  I guess I didn't view him in that way. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4836.360000000001s)]
*  But Jimmy's not one to bullshit about that. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4838.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4840.52s)]
*  Like he's, you know, he's seen KD. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4840.68s)]
*  He's like, yeah, KD is crazy. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4842.4400000000005s)]
*  Like anyway, but Jimmy's the type of guy that's going to win you a playoff game by himself. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4843.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4849.24s)]
*  So one of those games he will win you by himself. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4849.8s)]
*  I mean, he took them to the heat to the finals by himself. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4852.84s)]
*  So now you get some staff action. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4855.8s)]
*  Let's say Draymond steps it up. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4858.12s)]
*  I'm not saying he's going to be scoring, but there's a different level of intensity [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4859.64s)]
*  that Draymond is going to bring to the game in the playoffs. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4862.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4864.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's very hard to count the Warriors out. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4864.76s)]
*  That'd be an awesome story. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4868.04s)]
*  I imagine. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4869.0s)]
*  Lakers and Warriors would both be so fun. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4869.320000000001s)]
*  Yo, the NBA is fine this year if the Western Conference finals. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4871.320000000001s)]
*  What can it even look like that in the? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4875.160000000001s)]
*  I think. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4877.72s)]
*  Can it even go Lakers or are they going to play each other before that? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4878.200000000001s)]
*  I think they can because I think the Lakers are the three seed. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4880.84s)]
*  So they play the winner of the two seed. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4883.160000000001s)]
*  No, they would play. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4884.92s)]
*  Yeah, they play the second round. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4885.56s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4887.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4888.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4889.32s)]
*  Ah, whatever. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4891.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4892.28s)]
*  I think though, I don't know why I don't believe in the Rockets. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4893.4s)]
*  Maybe I just haven't watched enough this year, especially post-crate. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4895.719999999999s)]
*  But I don't. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4898.2s)]
*  I think that's a very winnable series for Golden State, I think. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4898.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think Golden State. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4901.48s)]
*  I think I'll tell you one thing. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4903.08s)]
*  I think the Rockets are scared shitless. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4904.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this is because it's all new to them. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4906.44s)]
*  I mean, now it's like, you know who you're going up against. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4908.36s)]
*  And you know these motherfuckers can hoop, especially in the playoffs. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4910.679999999999s)]
*  So it don't matter what happened during the regular season [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4913.5599999999995s)]
*  because you got half-assed play in the regular season. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4915.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4917.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4918.04s)]
*  So you let them, not you, but somehow they inch into the playoffs. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4919.16s)]
*  And now the season starts over. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4924.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4926.68s)]
*  And that's the other thing that, say what you want about the Lakers. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4927.16s)]
*  There were times during the season where Lebron at 40 is just carrying the team. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4929.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4932.84s)]
*  That's going to happen for the next few weeks. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4933.4s)]
*  You'll get fucking used to it. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4935.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4936.599999999999s)]
*  He took a few nights off so he could carry the team. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4937.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4939.0s)]
*  And now you got Luca, too. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4939.4s)]
*  And Luca can carry a team. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4940.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's the reason why the Lakers, now defensively, I don't know what happens. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4941.639999999999s)]
*  And obviously in the playoffs, you need to lock in. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4945.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4947.0s)]
*  But has Lebron been on a team, and I'm sure the answer is yes, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4947.4s)]
*  but has Lebron been on a team where there was another ball handler [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4951.4s)]
*  that could also do the things he can do, score from three, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4954.599999999999s)]
*  get a bucket whenever he wants, and get other people involved? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4959.799999999999s)]
*  Has he played with another? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4962.92s)]
*  Maybe Kyrie, but I don't know about getting other people involved. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4963.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4966.04s)]
*  Yo, Kyrie is a really good example. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4966.44s)]
*  And then look how well that went. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4967.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4969.799999999999s)]
*  Maybe D-Wade a little bit on the heat. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4971.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4972.5199999999995s)]
*  And look how well that went. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4972.759999999999s)]
*  It's like, it's almost like, I mean, this is so stupid to say. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4973.5599999999995s)]
*  Obviously, Lebron plays really well when another top five player in the league is on his team. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4976.68s)]
*  But specifically, AD, he's not taking the ball up, putting himself in position and scoring. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4979.96s)]
*  He kind of needs you to set him up a little bit. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4985.8s)]
*  Luka is like, you either get out the way and I get a bucket, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4988.04s)]
*  or you set a screen and I'm on some bum and I get a bucket. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4990.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4992.6s)]
*  And Lebron is the exact same. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4992.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4994.360000000001s)]
*  So I'm like, I haven't even given a fuck during the regular season. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4994.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4998.52s)]
*  But I'm kind of into this. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4998.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=4999.96s)]
*  It's going to be brutal for me to watch, but yeah. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5000.4400000000005s)]
*  What about the East? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5002.200000000001s)]
*  What happens in the East? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5003.08s)]

*  on average in New York. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5115.4s)]

*  That's not a celebrity. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5271.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not my fault you're not famous. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5274.76s)]
*  Yo, step it up. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5279.96s)]
*  I'm just saying he doesn't deny stuff. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5281.0s)]
*  Step it up. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5282.68s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5283.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5284.04s)]
*  Be a hedge fund manager or something. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5284.52s)]
*  I know you now. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5287.4800000000005s)]
*  So we can. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5288.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5288.6s)]
*  Here. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5289.16s)]
*  My name's Alex. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5289.4800000000005s)]
*  This is an important. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5290.12s)]
*  This is a very important question. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5291.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5292.92s)]
*  How do you communicate to somebody at a table that it's time to leave [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5294.2s)]
*  because you have another reservation without telling them it's time to leave? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5300.92s)]
*  You start taking things off the table. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5305.8s)]
*  So slowly, one item at a time, you start taking things off the table. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5307.88s)]
*  So the first thing is you start taking things off the table. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5312.92s)]
*  You've dropped the bill, right? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5315.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the first move. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5317.8s)]
*  Drop the bill. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5318.76s)]
*  The bill's on the table and they haven't paid it yet. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5320.360000000001s)]
*  Then you're going to slowly start taking things off the table [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5322.6s)]
*  until they realize potentially, subliminally, oh, we probably should go. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5325.240000000001s)]
*  They're removing things. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5329.88s)]
*  They may not. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5331.160000000001s)]
*  The next round would be like to offer them an afternoon drink [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5332.68s)]
*  somewhere else in the restaurant at the bar, another location. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5336.4400000000005s)]
*  So that's the emergency. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5339.240000000001s)]
*  Can I buy you guys a drink at the bar? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5341.8s)]
*  I need you off this table. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5344.76s)]
*  If you have to go there, you offer. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5345.72s)]
*  That's class. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5347.8s)]
*  I'm going to pay you to leave. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5349.320000000001s)]
*  Because you're guessing, right? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5352.200000000001s)]
*  You're guessing the amount of time people are going to stay [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5353.08s)]
*  and you've built this book off of that. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5354.92s)]
*  So if they're staying far too long, then it's going to start screwing up the next round. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5357.96s)]
*  That's why it's so, just to go back to that earlier question, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5362.12s)]
*  saying to someone, I have to leave in 45 minutes, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5365.240000000001s)]
*  is very valuable to a restaurant. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5368.92s)]
*  Incredibly valuable. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5370.280000000001s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5371.240000000001s)]
*  I would do that, especially now that we have a kid, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5372.92s)]
*  like if we just pop into some place and we're just like, hey, it's too enough. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5375.24s)]
*  I'll start it out. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5379.64s)]
*  We have 40 minutes with this baby before it's time. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5380.68s)]
*  And you'd be surprised how often that was. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5384.68s)]
*  Your chances are going to go through the roof. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5386.6s)]
*  Because in that early, like before, when is the rush? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5388.52s)]
*  Maybe like seven o'clock. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5390.92s)]
*  Yeah, starts around seven. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5392.84s)]
*  So if you're in that like six o'clock range, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5394.280000000001s)]
*  they're scared that you could push back, I imagine, the sevens. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5396.4400000000005s)]
*  I can't, even if that table is available, it's not really. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5398.84s)]
*  Because it's about to get set. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5401.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5402.92s)]
*  But you could potentially get in and get out. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5403.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5405.16s)]
*  And the restaurant just won a whole other seat. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5405.4s)]
*  That's pretty money. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5407.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5408.2s)]
*  Do people bring their kids to Carbone? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5409.08s)]
*  Very rarely. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5411.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel like a kid. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5412.12s)]
*  But like a five o'clock seating? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5413.48s)]
*  We frown on that. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5415.5599999999995s)]
*  He's trying to bring his kids. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5416.2s)]
*  So there's restaurants, there's different. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5420.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5421.799999999999s)]
*  What's more Italian American than bringing their kid to a restaurant? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5422.2s)]
*  Well, actually, what's more Italian? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5424.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5427.5599999999995s)]
*  Italian American might be different. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5428.04s)]
*  I'm curious, how do you communicate to people that it's not kid-friendly [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5430.28s)]
*  without saying it directly? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5433.879999999999s)]
*  I've seen some. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5435.08s)]
*  Well, I think it's actually part of our reservation protocol. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5435.719999999999s)]
*  Like you make a reservation, the email confirmation probably says [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5438.2s)]
*  that some of the restaurants that like children under a certain age. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5441.08s)]
*  So there's. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5445.32s)]
*  Along with like shorts and sandals. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5445.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5447.5599999999995s)]
*  Like that. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5448.2s)]
*  There's, yeah, some restaurants just won't have baby chairs. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5449.32s)]
*  That's a great way of doing it. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5453.08s)]
*  I mean, if you're like a brunch restaurant, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5455.32s)]
*  then that's obviously a kid-friendly environment. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5456.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5458.44s)]
*  You're going for like a really nice dinner, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5458.68s)]
*  probably at the place for an infant. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5462.92s)]
*  How do you talk to someone that shows up in sandals? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5465.320000000001s)]
*  That's why we built it into that. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5468.280000000001s)]
*  That's why we have like a backup and says, hey, listen, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5469.72s)]
*  it's actually on your reservation. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5471.96s)]
*  It says, you know, like proper attire. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5473.240000000001s)]
*  Do you reschedule it? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5475.240000000001s)]
*  Or actually ask some questions for him. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5476.04s)]
*  In Miami, you'll wind up sitting outside. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5478.52s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5480.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5481.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5482.12s)]
*  This is how you enforce the sandal requirement. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5483.240000000001s)]
*  There's another way of enforcing it, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5486.76s)]
*  which my dad taught me not about restaurants, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5488.280000000001s)]
*  but it was like the way that the people that work there are dressed [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5490.68s)]
*  defines how the people that attend dress. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5495.400000000001s)]
*  So if you have everybody that works there in tuxedos, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5498.4400000000005s)]
*  it's hard to show up in shorts. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5501.08s)]
*  But if everybody that works there is in shorts, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5503.96s)]
*  then the people that show are going to be in shorts. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5506.4400000000005s)]
*  And they'll feel better. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5508.6s)]
*  Can I call out somebody that refuses to wear pants? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5508.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5511.400000000001s)]
*  Noriega. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5512.360000000001s)]
*  Noriega wears shorts everywhere. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5513.56s)]
*  Fucking refuses to put pants on. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5515.08s)]
*  I don't have the old pants. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5517.08s)]
*  Go grab me the drink champs, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5519.32s)]
*  heavyweight championship belt that's out there. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5521.4s)]
*  Refuses to wear pants. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5523.08s)]
*  Like not to the restaurant, in life. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5525.64s)]
*  Because he's on the run eating. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5528.2s)]
*  Sounds good. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5531.8s)]
*  Carbone in Noriega. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5532.44s)]
*  You can't be on the run if you're not in shorts. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5533.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, so you enforce the shorts rule even in the Miami? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5536.92s)]
*  You sit outside if you're in shorts. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5540.68s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5542.28s)]
*  Can I ask a question based on that? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5542.84s)]
*  Do you miss the outside dining at your New York location? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5544.04s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5547.56s)]
*  I was just wondering. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5548.12s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5548.76s)]
*  I mean, listen, it was revenue for us. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5549.16s)]
*  It was good revenue for us. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5550.84s)]
*  But for the city, it had to go. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5551.96s)]
*  It had to go. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5555.16s)]
*  Why? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5556.5199999999995s)]
*  Because there was no rules around it. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5557.32s)]
*  These restaurants don't really have extra money to do it, right? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5559.64s)]
*  But they need to capitalize on it. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5562.5199999999995s)]
*  So they're building up these shanty towns in front of their revenue. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5564.28s)]
*  It's a horrendous look for the city. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5569.56s)]
*  Thank you, Ricky. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5573.08s)]
*  It breeds in. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5573.72s)]
*  What's going on here? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5575.08s)]
*  So this is... [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5576.12s)]
*  I just did Drink Champs and I got the belt. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5577.0s)]
*  Did you win something or you just get it? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5579.72s)]
*  No, I just put it on. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5581.08s)]
*  He's like, nobody's ever done this all the episodes we've ever had. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5582.04s)]
*  He goes, I want you to take this with you. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5585.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5587.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5587.8s)]
*  So this is the Drink Champs heavyweight belt. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5588.76s)]
*  But you know, listen, this can be with you right here. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5590.84s)]
*  This is nice. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5592.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5593.8s)]
*  Come on. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5595.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5597.16s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5597.4800000000005s)]
*  Nice piece. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5598.12s)]
*  Here's a question. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5598.92s)]
*  You got carbons all over the world now, or at least the country. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5599.88s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the world. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5603.08s)]
*  No, you got some gold. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5603.72s)]
*  How do you maintain quality, consistency? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5604.68s)]
*  It's the number one thing that I spend the most of my time on. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5608.36s)]
*  And the most difficult thing, I think, is consistency. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5612.28s)]
*  Trying to build protocols and like, you know, WhatsApp chats and video zooming and digital [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5617.0s)]
*  recipes and all sorts of like processes so that their chefs can communicate all over the world [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5624.36s)]
*  because they're all making virtually the same thing. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5631.08s)]
*  We're spending more money and more time every year to try to get better at it. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5634.12s)]
*  It's really hard. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5638.44s)]
*  It's really the hardest thing. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5639.48s)]
*  It's harder than everyone assumes it's staffing, which is hard. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5640.92s)]
*  But once you get good people, I think they stay because they want to be part of a good [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5645.32s)]
*  team and they want to make good money, right? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5649.32s)]
*  It's the consistency that is number one by far for me and the thing that will keep me up most at night. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5651.32s)]
*  Yeah, consistency is, I think, or inconsistency is the one thing that would make me stop going [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5657.32s)]
*  to a restaurant. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5663.5599999999995s)]
*  Like how many chances are you going to give a restaurant? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5664.28s)]
*  How many? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5665.96s)]
*  One. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5666.84s)]
*  And if it fucks up, I hesitate the next time. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5668.679999999999s)]
*  Because there's, think about it, there's like, especially when you're in New York City, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5672.28s)]
*  there's hundreds of restaurants you haven't even tried yet. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5675.16s)]
*  So if I keep going to the same restaurant, I'm making a choice to not go to all those [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5677.88s)]
*  other ones. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5681.16s)]
*  And if you fuck up the meal that I'm expecting and excited to have one time, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5681.88s)]
*  the next time I'm about to go, I'm like, shit, I might get fucked up again. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5686.2s)]
*  It's not only the meal. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5689.16s)]
*  Not only did I lose that customer, how many people did he tell him? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5689.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5691.88s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5692.36s)]
*  And it's not just the meal, it's the service, it's the music, it's the table you get. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5693.08s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5696.599999999999s)]
*  So you can't have the chef there seven days a week. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5697.08s)]
*  No. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5699.0s)]
*  Is your A chef as good as your B chef? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5700.44s)]
*  No, otherwise you'd be the A chef. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5703.4s)]
*  So then how do you maintain consistency? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5704.84s)]
*  Or maybe a better question is, what days is your A chef there? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5708.2s)]
*  It's tough with Carbone because we're blessed to kind of have the same business almost every [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5711.48s)]
*  night. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5715.4s)]
*  Usually what you do is you put your B chef on your B nights, right? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5715.719999999999s)]
*  Which is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5718.44s)]
*  Sunday maybe, depending on the location. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5720.04s)]
*  I feel like New York Sunday is a big... [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5722.5199999999995s)]
*  Sunday can be big. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5724.2s)]
*  It depends. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5725.16s)]
*  If you're uptown or you're midtown, the weekends are quiet. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5725.48s)]
*  Because that's more first. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5728.5199999999995s)]
*  Midtown's Monday to Friday. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5729.08s)]
*  Saturday, Sunday, quiet. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5730.92s)]
*  Usually Sunday closed. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5731.96s)]
*  Midtown, quiet. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5734.679999999999s)]
*  Downtown, you have a good Sunday, so you're looking at Monday, Tuesday. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5735.799999999999s)]
*  The best nights for us in the company are Wednesday, Thursday, usually. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5740.28s)]
*  Because what, the weekends are good to go away? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5743.5599999999995s)]
*  Thursday's like the biggest night of the week for sales. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5744.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5747.72s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5748.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5749.24s)]
*  It's always, it's been like that for a while now. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5750.12s)]
*  Thursday, I mean, yeah, you get a Friday. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5752.12s)]
*  Saturday is that kind of like bridge and tunnel thing. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5754.68s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5757.64s)]
*  And it's a lower check average. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5759.56s)]
*  It's more customers. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5760.68s)]
*  They eat for less period of time. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5762.04s)]
*  Jersey. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5763.88s)]
*  They spend less money. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5764.68s)]
*  They spend less time there. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5765.88s)]
*  We do more reservations. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5767.32s)]
*  It takes more customers to do the same number of revenue. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5768.76s)]
*  Yeah, they have to leave because they got to go to DC Galaxy. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5771.32s)]
*  They got to go back to the kids, the nanny, whatever. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5773.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5777.08s)]
*  How do you preserve the brand? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5778.44s)]
*  So not only is the restaurant and all the particulars of actually dealing with the day to day, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5780.2s)]
*  but the brand of Carbone, like this global entity, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5784.2s)]
*  how do you make sure that doesn't get diluted as you spread into more markets? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5787.32s)]
*  It's a great question. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5792.28s)]
*  I think you have to one, be okay with a certain amount of dilution, right? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5793.5599999999995s)]
*  You have to understand that it's no longer as potent as it was when there was one. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5797.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5801.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5801.639999999999s)]
*  There you have to make peace with that. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5803.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5804.62s)]
*  You're now on an entrepreneurial journey and it's no longer about, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5805.26s)]
*  I'm the chef of this one restaurant. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5809.26s)]
*  I'm here every night. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5811.18s)]
*  I'm going to cook for you, which is a beautiful thing. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5811.900000000001s)]
*  But when you've made that choice to take on a more entrepreneurial venture, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5814.860000000001s)]
*  you have to make peace with that to a certain degree. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5820.22s)]
*  And now that we're growing further and further beyond that one location, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5822.860000000001s)]
*  it becomes consistency. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5827.58s)]
*  Can somebody on the other side of the world tonight [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5830.379999999999s)]
*  have a very similar pasta than they will at New York? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5833.5s)]
*  For me, that's all the brand. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5838.62s)]
*  That's the brand right there, right? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5840.219999999999s)]
*  I can set the playlist. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5842.7s)]
*  I can make the uniforms the same. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5843.98s)]
*  I can do all of those moves. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5845.82s)]
*  But what's going to happen when the waiter delivers that plate of food? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5847.58s)]
*  Is there ever a moment where you're like, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5851.339999999999s)]
*  this dish is too difficult to replicate the same way? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5853.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5856.46s)]
*  And then in that circumstance, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5857.42s)]
*  do you just reduce the level of difficulty of the dish? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5859.099999999999s)]
*  And what dish? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5862.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've done that a lot over the last few years, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5865.259999999999s)]
*  is trying to make things that are, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5868.86s)]
*  I call them big bullseye, you know, like they have a big bullseye. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5871.98s)]
*  They're much more easily replicable for whatever reason [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5875.42s)]
*  than a dish that takes a lot of in the moment talent. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5879.9s)]
*  Like the ticket comes in, I ordered this thing, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5885.9800000000005s)]
*  and it takes a great deal of talent to make this from scratch [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5888.14s)]
*  versus something that is predetermined to be in a big strike zone. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5891.9800000000005s)]
*  And I have a pretty good confidence that it's going to land somewhere here [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5898.9400000000005s)]
*  and it's going to be pretty tasty. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5902.780000000001s)]
*  Can you give us examples of big bullseye and maybe even small bullseye? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5904.14s)]
*  Like rigatoni vodka, which I sell, you know, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5907.02s)]
*  probably the most of all the restaurants, right? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5909.740000000001s)]
*  You call it rigatoni vodka. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5911.34s)]
*  That's what you call your dish. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5912.860000000001s)]
*  Rigatoni ala vodka? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5913.900000000001s)]
*  Everybody calls it spicy rig. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5915.0199999999995s)]
*  You don't know that that's what everybody calls it, the spicy rig? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5918.0599999999995s)]
*  The spicy rig? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5921.0199999999995s)]
*  You don't know this about you? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5923.9s)]
*  The spicy rig? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5925.179999999999s)]
*  You don't know this about me? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5925.9s)]
*  It's like I'm finding out Hulk Hogan doesn't know about ripping his shirt off. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5928.94s)]
*  You don't know it's called the spicy rig? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5933.0199999999995s)]
*  With a the? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5935.42s)]
*  It's so profound, it's called the spicy rig. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5936.54s)]
*  Go to Carbone, get the spicy rig. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5940.3s)]
*  Get the spicy rig. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5941.82s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You're not aware that that's how people speak about it? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5943.34s)]
*  I didn't really think that it was like it had a title like that. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5946.860000000001s)]
*  He's doing market research. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5950.06s)]
*  There's a prefix, there's a the? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5950.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay, I would like to enter this discussion. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5955.66s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5957.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware of like the dish from different restaurants. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5959.02s)]
*  I name a restaurant, you know exactly what it is. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5962.06s)]
*  What's the dish? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5963.82s)]
*  Polo bar. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5964.7s)]
*  The burger. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5965.82s)]
*  That's interesting. You went with burger. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5967.34s)]
*  We're going to go with the pastrami? [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5969.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5970.7s)]
*  I mean I feel like it's iconic for that burger. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5972.16s)]
*  I think the specialty burgers they do are better than the burger that's on the menu. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5976.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5982.24s)]
*  But it doesn't matter but the pastrami sandwich maybe. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5982.74s)]
*  Okay. For you guys, spicy rig. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5985.04s)]
*  Yep. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5988.32s)]
*  I also think there's another thing for you guys which is like it's experiential. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5989.04s)]
*  I think the polo bar is in that version too. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5992.5599999999995s)]
*  100%. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5994.48s)]
*  You're walking into a world. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5995.679999999999s)]
*  It's immersive. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5996.88s)]
*  As you described it earlier like the play is I think that's [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=5997.679999999999s)]
*  I haven't heard it described that way but I think that's perfect. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6001.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6003.5199999999995s)]
*  Because you're getting experience the second you're not. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6003.84s)]
*  It's actually like all the heavy lifting isn't on the food. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6006.16s)]
*  The lifting has done the second you walk in. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6009.04s)]
*  Imagine you can be Henry Hill walking in the back of Copa. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6012.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6015.92s)]
*  If I can deliver that. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6017.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6018.48s)]
*  But that's a perfect shot, right? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6020.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6021.92s)]
*  That's a perfect shot that Scorsese set up to have all that shit happening. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6022.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6026.0s)]
*  That I have to have running for six hours, right? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6026.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6029.599999999999s)]
*  I have to have a six hour Fellini movie happening at all times. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6030.1s)]
*  Where there's a guy lighting something on fire. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6033.3s)]
*  There's a hot girl in the corner. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6035.54s)]
*  There's something there's an athlete over there and then you walk in. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6037.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6040.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6040.58s)]
*  And you're having that Henry Hill moment. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6041.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6042.740000000001s)]
*  I've got to have that going for six hours. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6043.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6045.700000000001s)]
*  That's great. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6047.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6047.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6049.620000000001s)]
*  Terezi for example, what would you go with? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6051.06s)]
*  What is the dish? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6052.9800000000005s)]
*  What is the thing that speaks to you? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6054.34s)]
*  Or just stands out? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6056.42s)]
*  The dish there for me is there's a couple. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6058.18s)]
*  There's the Jamaican beef patty cavatelli, which we've been doing since the original. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6062.18s)]
*  Because when we built Terezi. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6068.42s)]
*  Rich, did you see it just took credit for your dish? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6070.42s)]
*  That's a big week. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6074.34s)]
*  That restaurant. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6077.62s)]
*  The Tramadoro, the tortellini. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6078.12s)]
*  Yeah, the tortellini is probably the one. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6079.62s)]
*  The tortellini is crazy too. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6081.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6083.139999999999s)]
*  We wanted to make Italian food that was new. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6084.339999999999s)]
*  We call it New Yorkese. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6086.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6088.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6088.5199999999995s)]
*  It was like, because there isn't really Italian food in Italy. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6088.82s)]
*  It's there's regional Italian food and they don't fuck with the other regions. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6092.339999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6095.299999999999s)]
*  Like Tuscany doesn't care about Sicily. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6095.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6097.459999999999s)]
*  There's no like. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6097.62s)]
*  They just became Italy. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6098.179999999999s)]
*  Before that there are these individual. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6099.459999999999s)]
*  They've been in Italy way less years than we've been America. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6100.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6102.98s)]
*  And so we were like, what if we make our own region of Italian food that is New Yorkese? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6104.5s)]
*  That's great. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6109.94s)]
*  So we pulled from the Jewish, the Jewish Lower East Side. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6110.66s)]
*  We pulled from Jamaican beef patties being in pizzerias randomly. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6114.0199999999995s)]
*  We pulled from. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6117.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6118.58s)]
*  That is great. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6119.08s)]
*  All the German, the German lochia. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6119.58s)]
*  We pulled from all of that. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6120.9s)]
*  That was New York to make this food that was our New York food. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6122.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6126.42s)]
*  We believed that we were doing the most Italian thing possible by not making Italian food. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6127.7s)]
*  So what do you think the dish is for, for, for Carbone? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6133.7s)]
*  Brigatoni. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6139.54s)]
*  It's the spicy rig, right? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6140.26s)]
*  And that's the one that you think is the. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6141.46s)]
*  Brigatoni is the student thing. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6142.42s)]
*  It's the student thing. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6143.860000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6145.14s)]
*  It's the, yeah. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6145.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6146.5s)]
*  So what I think is it's spicy rig and then the Caesar. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6146.74s)]
*  And then I think the, not the sleeper, but the, the one that actually knocks your socks off [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6150.34s)]
*  is the Veal Parm. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6157.38s)]
*  So it's like the spicy rig everybody knows about. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6159.62s)]
*  It's like obviously synonymous with the brand, but not everybody gets the Veal Parm. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6162.5s)]
*  And then when you get it, it's like, why the fuck did anybody tell me about this? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6166.98s)]
*  Cause I don't think I got the apartment. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6172.259999999999s)]
*  So maybe a few times that I went there, but also the, it's the experience with the Caesar salad. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6173.78s)]
*  That's really fun. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6179.219999999999s)]
*  Like having them make it in front of you, that goes back to the theater. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6180.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6182.74s)]
*  Have you ever introduced a dish to any of the restaurants that didn't want all the time? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6183.459999999999s)]
*  Like what's an example? [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6187.78s)]
*  Give me the biggest bomb. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6188.5s)]
*  We're comedians. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6190.179999999999s)]
*  We love bomb stories. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6190.74s)]
*  Bombs are more like no one orders it, right? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6191.78s)]
*  Like less they order it and they don't like it more like you put all this effort into something [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6194.5s)]
*  and zero, and for chefs, usually it's like really chefy shit, right? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6200.02s)]
*  Like you want to, you want to get, you want to get away from the mainstream ingredients [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6207.46s)]
*  because something's in season or something's, you know, some farmer drops something off [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6211.7s)]
*  and you're really excited about it. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6215.46s)]
*  And you joke. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6216.74s)]
*  And particularly at Carbone because you're being bulldozed with the number one menu, right? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6217.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6222.34s)]
*  Everyone's now ordering through social media and like the thing you have to order to be there, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6222.9s)]
*  right? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6228.259999999999s)]
*  It's so hard to sell them something else at this point because they need the, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6229.54s)]
*  they need the, the, the, the verification of being there. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6233.219999999999s)]
*  It's like bird crush of a machine story. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6236.82s)]
*  So I can't. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6238.34s)]
*  We came for it. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6238.9s)]
*  No, no, no, this thing's a, I sure get the rigatoni, but I promise you, this is great. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6239.86s)]
*  So do you try it? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6243.86s)]
*  Because you always hear something like the specials are, oh, these are older ingredients [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6244.66s)]
*  that the chef is trying to get rid of or whatever is sometimes the special, this dish that the chef [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6250.02s)]
*  really wants to add to the menu, maybe in the way we would try a joke at an open mic. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6255.14s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6259.14s)]
*  Or specials just something that you generally shouldn't mess with? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6259.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I think specials this day and age are something that they're actually trying to work on [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6263.06s)]
*  and it's new. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6267.700000000001s)]
*  I rather reprint the menu and not verbal a special. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6269.46s)]
*  And so that when like Ricky verbals things at your table, that's part of a script, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6273.06s)]
*  like kind of a script. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6277.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6278.580000000001s)]
*  Because there, I want there to be a back and forth between you and the waiter. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6278.82s)]
*  I don't want to just drop menus and then you come back and you tell me what you ordered. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6282.74s)]
*  There's no, there's nothing, there's nothing there for me. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6286.98s)]
*  And I think I want a conversation. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6289.38s)]
*  Yeah, you want the. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6290.82s)]
*  So I force these things. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6291.62s)]
*  I force conversational moments during the order taking. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6292.82s)]
*  Like meatballs are not on the menu at Carbone. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6297.139999999999s)]
*  That's an intentional thing because as soon as you order pasta, that's a trigger for the [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6300.179999999999s)]
*  waiter to say, you want meatballs? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6306.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6307.7s)]
*  You want to put some meatballs? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6308.26s)]
*  It's automatically a service feels better for me because we're having a conversation. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6309.06s)]
*  Where you're having a dialogue. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6312.02s)]
*  There's a back and forth happening and you're now all of a sudden, you're now trusting this [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6314.26s)]
*  person. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6320.34s)]
*  You're putting the rest of your experience in their hands. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6320.900000000001s)]
*  Later on, you're not even going to know, but hey, just choose some desserts for me. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6323.14s)]
*  Right? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6326.1s)]
*  You trust them. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6326.34s)]
*  They're captaining your experience and it's kind of a script that we like, we laid out [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6327.46s)]
*  in the book is I want to demoralize like the language of Carbone because that's how we [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6332.66s)]
*  take an order there. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6337.3s)]
*  Are there any other secret menu items? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6339.14s)]
*  Like you have the meatballs, obviously they're kind of off menu, but anything else that someone [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6341.14s)]
*  could order? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6344.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6344.820000000001s)]
*  There's all sorts of like little, we call them pocket moves, right? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6345.06s)]
*  Like things that you can do. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6348.26s)]
*  I hate when the waiter has to ask the chef. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6351.46s)]
*  Like when the waiter says that, oh, let me ask the chef. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6354.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6356.34s)]
*  I really don't like that. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6356.900000000001s)]
*  I hate it in my restaurants. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6357.9400000000005s)]
*  So I try to make sure that the waiter, the waiter is the captain's, they know all the [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6359.7s)]
*  things that are possible so that when they're at a table and they're talking to you and [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6364.34s)]
*  you're like, yeah, no, I don't want the prosciutto. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6368.34s)]
*  I don't eat pork. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6371.38s)]
*  Oh, I can do roasted peppers with the mozzarella for you. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6372.34s)]
*  That's not on the menu, but he knows he's going to go ask the chef. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6375.54s)]
*  Smart, smart. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6378.900000000001s)]
*  I know what I can do for you. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6379.62s)]
*  I can do this, right? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6380.66s)]
*  Vio Parma. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6381.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm not in the mood for Vio Parma tonight. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6382.5s)]
*  You want to do a little Milanese? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6383.54s)]
*  We'll put a little arugula salad, some tomatoes on a little lime. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6384.58s)]
*  Yeah, let's do that. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6387.38s)]
*  Great. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6388.42s)]
*  We'll do Milanese. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6388.66s)]
*  Dad, these are real waiters. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6390.58s)]
*  These are lifelong waiters. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6392.18s)]
*  These are not transient people that are on their way to another thing. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6394.02s)]
*  This is how they feed their family, right? [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6399.780000000001s)]
*  So like give them all the tools to take care of this table and let us cook. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6401.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, that's the model. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6407.14s)]
*  What are your other pet peeves for restaurants? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6409.38s)]
*  Might be my own. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6414.42s)]
*  Not your own restaurants, but just pet peeves in general. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6415.860000000001s)]
*  Like you go to a place. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6418.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6419.860000000001s)]
*  What do you hate and you try to avoid? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6420.34s)]
*  I'm really sensitive to lighting and music in restaurants at this point. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6421.46s)]
*  If the lighting is really harsh or the music is just off, too loud, off theme, abrasive, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6425.22s)]
*  I'm not feeling it. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6432.18s)]
*  I'm immediately put in a weird like place. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6433.78s)]
*  I'm not comfortable. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6437.38s)]
*  I'm not cozy. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6438.42s)]
*  I want warm lighting. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6439.06s)]
*  I want whatever the music is. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6440.58s)]
*  I want it to be the vibe of what I think this place is. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6442.02s)]
*  And then those are my two biggest ones because that, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6446.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that sets the tone. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6450.58s)]
*  You know, how do I put people in their position to just kind of succumb to my thing tonight? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6452.0199999999995s)]
*  And if you're not feeling it, you're uncomfortable, you're immediately, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6457.62s)]
*  you're in a defensive place and I don't want that. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6462.5s)]
*  I want you to give in. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6464.82s)]
*  I want you to be part of my movie. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6466.34s)]
*  I want you to be an extra in this thing. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6467.54s)]
*  And to give in, you have to be totally comfortable and you've mentally bought into this thing. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6469.14s)]
*  As soon as that guy walks up to your table with giant menus, you're giving in. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6474.74s)]
*  This is, it's in your hands. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6480.66s)]
*  So the menus being huge is a thing. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6482.34s)]
*  Cartoonishly huge is a thing. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6484.9s)]
*  What purpose does it serve? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6487.0599999999995s)]
*  It's, I mean, it felt like to me at the time when we did it again, we were going against. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6489.14s)]
*  To people that don't know, can you just with your hands show how big a menu is from Carbone? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6495.14s)]
*  I mean, it's probably, you know, he's not exaggerating. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6499.78s)]
*  Two, three feet by three feet. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6505.62s)]
*  It's a small flat screen TV. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6506.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6508.5s)]
*  It's gigantic. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6509.700000000001s)]
*  At the time we were going against the micro tasting menu. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6511.06s)]
*  It was like a little index card. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6514.26s)]
*  You're here all night. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6516.18s)]
*  It's the chef's way. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6517.780000000001s)]
*  There's no substitute. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6519.22s)]
*  You have no autonomy, no agency. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6520.02s)]
*  You mean you matter nothing. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6521.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6523.700000000001s)]
*  You matter nothing. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6524.5s)]
*  And here, you know, I remember writing in Italian, like have it kind of have it your way. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6526.34s)]
*  Like it says, like the way you want it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6531.22s)]
*  If you don't see anything on this menu, tell me what you want. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6534.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6538.02s)]
*  We want it to be a yes restaurant because that's to me, that's what Italian restaurants are like. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6538.9s)]
*  Italian restaurants by nature, especially in Italy, is a night off for mom and dad. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6543.54s)]
*  It's because you eat so well at home. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6548.9s)]
*  That's wow. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6551.54s)]
*  This is so fascinating. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6552.66s)]
*  I never even considered that. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6553.7s)]
*  You eat so well at home that to go out, it's a night off for them. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6554.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6560.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're just using this restaurant as a conduit to eat well. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6560.74s)]
*  Hopefully. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6565.7s)]
*  I never considered that. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6566.26s)]
*  In a eat in culture like Italy, it is not surprising that both parents know how to cook extremely well. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6567.86s)]
*  Extremely well. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6574.66s)]
*  In America, maybe one is proficient at cooking and my family neither. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6575.7s)]
*  We ordered in every single night growing up in New York City and we had the luxury to do that. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6580.74s)]
*  But like it was only like most family, maybe one knows how to do it. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6584.0199999999995s)]
*  In Italy, both probably. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6587.7s)]
*  If not them, close relatives, non-parent are ready to rock. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6590.339999999999s)]
*  So to choose to go out, of course the mom and pop restaurants are going to have high level cuisine [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6594.42s)]
*  because at home you're competing with some serious shit. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6600.1s)]
*  You'll see legit grandma. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6603.78s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6604.74s)]
*  I never considered that. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6605.3s)]
*  So a night off. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6606.34s)]
*  So the only reason you would go out, it's not to have better food. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6607.22s)]
*  We would go out to have better food because my parents were proficient. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6610.18s)]
*  You're going out to have a break from cooking and cleaning. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6613.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6617.54s)]
*  And you're hoping it's as good as what's at home. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6618.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6621.14s)]
*  You're hoping. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6621.54s)]
*  But bare minimum, what you can do is not bust my balls. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6622.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6625.14s)]
*  And that's what probably experiences. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6625.54s)]
*  I know what I'm talking about. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6626.820000000001s)]
*  I'm a customer that's highly edgy. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6627.860000000001s)]
*  I know what I want. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6629.3s)]
*  This is. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6630.1s)]
*  Give me this. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6630.660000000001s)]
*  I never considered the competition. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6631.780000000001s)]
*  The greatest competition for restaurants in Italy is not other restaurants. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6633.700000000001s)]
*  It's how you cook in your own house. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6637.620000000001s)]
*  That's why by and large super fine dining in Italy is not great. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6639.620000000001s)]
*  You know, in my opinion, because they're competing with phenomenal base food of their mom [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6643.22s)]
*  and their grandma. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6649.86s)]
*  And so they're trying to make this thing that's new, this new take on it when the base product [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6651.219999999999s)]
*  is fucking fantastic. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6657.139999999999s)]
*  And any time that I've gone to one of those places and my wife and I have gone to Italy, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6658.82s)]
*  and you're like, why did I go? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6662.339999999999s)]
*  It's not it. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6663.7s)]
*  It's not it, dude. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6664.98s)]
*  It's you need to find a no no somewhere. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6666.179999999999s)]
*  Or just go to that mom and pop restaurant that people talk about. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6668.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've been in Florence and we have legit grandmas cooking the food. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6671.0599999999995s)]
*  And it was like, this is fantastic. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6674.0199999999995s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second because I just saved your traveling experience. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6675.54s)]
*  And by me, I mean, extra. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6679.62s)]
*  You know, the wallets obviously has consolidated all the things that you need, a wallet that's [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6681.46s)]
*  made for the digital economy, a wallet that's not going to be well, I can't say if it's [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6685.9400000000005s)]
*  going to be stolen or not. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6690.820000000001s)]
*  But what I can say is that if they do steal it, you can track them. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6691.78s)]
*  You can go right to their house. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6695.22s)]
*  You can rob them back double. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6696.26s)]
*  And it's completely legal. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6697.46s)]
*  I'm pretty sure in most countries, definitely the United States of America. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6698.74s)]
*  Don't quote me on that. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6702.5s)]
*  But listen, there's this bag that's in front of me right now. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6703.3s)]
*  What is this bag used for? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6705.62s)]
*  Clothing. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6707.22s)]
*  It has a vacuum seal option right here for your clothes. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6709.54s)]
*  It's like your gym clothes if they smell. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6715.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's your gym clothes. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6716.900000000001s)]
*  Or also, if you just want to travel, right, and you just want to make sure that you can [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6718.02s)]
*  fit as many shirts as possible, you can look at them. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6722.820000000001s)]
*  Look, I'm vacuum sealing this shit right now. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6726.26s)]
*  They got this vacuum seal thing right here. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6728.820000000001s)]
*  OK, what is that going to do? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6730.740000000001s)]
*  It's going to put 15 shirts into a tiny little part of your bag. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6731.7s)]
*  You're going to pack everything you possibly need because you would [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6734.900000000001s)]
*  definitely be using it to pack shirts 100%. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6736.98s)]
*  Nothing else. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6739.78s)]
*  No other materials, no other incredibly profitable, illegal things that you could use this for. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6740.66s)]
*  This is for clothing. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6746.9s)]
*  And that's what X-Star wants you to use it for. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6747.94s)]
*  And they're not responsible if you use it for anything else. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6750.259999999999s)]
*  You can take that information and do what the hell you want with it. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6752.98s)]
*  But for me, clothing, because my wife and my baby are going to take up pretty much all [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6755.62s)]
*  the storage in any of our bags, I have been relegated to finding clever ways to pack the [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6760.0199999999995s)]
*  clothes that I want to wear whenever I go places. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6765.3s)]
*  And X-Star has my bag. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6768.1s)]
*  Also, having a bag within your bag, incredible, by the way. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6769.38s)]
*  Organize all the things you need, stuff it, contain it. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6773.3s)]
*  You never have to go, oh, we don't have room for that. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6776.900000000001s)]

*  Guys, one of the most underrated movies to come out in the last like 20 years is getting [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6815.700000000001s)]

*  If you have not seen The Accountant, you need to go do that right now. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6820.02s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6823.46s)]
*  It's got Ben Affleck. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6824.1s)]
*  It's not about accounting. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6824.9800000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6825.94s)]

*  And that was like that. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6958.42s)]
*  How was your Italian at the time and how much better did it get? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6960.02s)]
*  It was not good at all. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6962.1s)]
*  But I had, this is before technology in your pocket. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6965.22s)]
*  This is 2000. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6969.3s)]
*  I had a little book in my, like a little translator in my back pocket, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6971.14s)]
*  a little thesaurus, and I would learn what I needed for the day. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6974.66s)]
*  And by the time I was done, I spoke the language. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6977.54s)]
*  What did they think of you as like an Italian American? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6979.78s)]
*  They thought I was like, they thought I was crazy, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6982.66s)]

*  Why do you work so hard? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6990.58s)]
*  Can't you just take the afternoon off? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6992.26s)]
*  It's not all about the paycheck. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6994.9800000000005s)]
*  You need to instill the beauty of the process. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=6998.660000000001s)]
*  And a lot of it was going to the field to find the thing or visiting the farmer. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7006.42s)]
*  Exactly what you would think the quintessential food experience would be in Tuscany. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7012.42s)]
*  I got to live that. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7016.740000000001s)]
*  A certain mushroom would come in and the chef would be like, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7019.3s)]
*  hey, go up that road right there. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7022.1s)]

*  And like, yeah. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7025.38s)]
*  There's an herb that grows over there. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7026.34s)]
*  Pick a bunch of it and bring it over. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7027.78s)]
*  It goes for this mushroom. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7029.46s)]
*  Like shit like that that would happen to me. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7031.54s)]
*  That's just like as a kid from Queens was like as life changing as it gets. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7032.98s)]
*  The Italian food that I knew was the Italian food I make today. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7036.9s)]
*  Like real Italian greasy Italian American food. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7039.62s)]
*  That was like, wow, this is where it comes from. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7043.139999999999s)]
*  This is Vito Corleone. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7046.259999999999s)]
*  How do you feel about pop-up restaurants with like the curated night? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7048.099999999999s)]
*  That's a story to the night. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7053.7s)]
*  You know, they have like the tables that what's it called? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7055.86s)]
*  The tables that we all share. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7059.7s)]
*  Communal table. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7061.379999999999s)]
*  Communal table. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7061.86s)]
*  Like how do you feel about those? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7062.66s)]
*  Because I feel like those are becoming way more popular. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7063.54s)]
*  And then they try to infuse like Nigerian and Italian like crazy mixes that you wouldn't [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7066.66s)]
*  necessarily see. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7071.94s)]
*  But I think it's more of a gimmick or is it like it depends on who's doing it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7073.0599999999995s)]
*  But like I think if it's great, it's great. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7077.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7078.82s)]
*  Like if you believe it, if you're about it, if you've put the work into it, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7079.0599999999995s)]
*  like why can't that be your transport of experience? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7084.66s)]
*  It doesn't have to be mine. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7086.82s)]
*  Mine's mine. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7088.42s)]

*  Is there any point in time where you're there that you get caught up in their appreciation [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7113.46s)]
*  of life and you're able to kind of relax? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7117.86s)]
*  Do some of your ambitions subside? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7119.94s)]
*  I think I learned a great appreciation for how they live. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7124.26s)]
*  I think at 20 years old, as someone who wanted to like tackle the world, probably not. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7127.78s)]
*  I think I was just as bullish coming back to the States after that trip about wanting [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7136.1s)]
*  to be this chef entrepreneur who conquers New York more than ever. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7142.660000000001s)]
*  I don't think I've, I didn't really, I mean, I loved my like afternoons playing soccer, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7147.14s)]
*  you know, like getting four hours off between lunch and dinner, but I knew that that wasn't [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7151.620000000001s)]
*  my life. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7157.46s)]
*  I knew that I was coming back to Manhattan to be in the jungle and to conquer it. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7158.02s)]
*  I lived in Barcelona while I was in college from 20 to 21. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7162.660000000001s)]
*  But I had a similar experience and there was this moment where I was like, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7167.22s)]
*  wow, this is really enjoyable. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7170.42s)]
*  Like hanging out with my friends, playing basketball together, going out, living on [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7171.86s)]
*  10 euros a day, five euros of the 10 was spent to get into a bar and I got a free drink with [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7175.86s)]
*  the entrance. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7182.02s)]
*  Like I saw this version of a life for me and it kind of scared me. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7182.66s)]
*  I was like, well, this is too comfortable. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7187.06s)]
*  I could enjoy this and I could do this, but there's this other part of me that was compelled [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7188.58s)]
*  to go do something quote unquote great as if that's not great. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7193.54s)]
*  Yep. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7196.66s)]
*  That's also great. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7197.22s)]
*  It is interesting that like despite learning all those things, you still felt like the [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7198.74s)]
*  pull. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7203.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7204.5s)]
*  I think that's an American cultural trait that we don't communicate to each other enough. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7205.94s)]
*  Europeans seem to know it about us. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7212.259999999999s)]
*  But I almost think that like it's expected of us and we're unaware of it. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7215.0599999999995s)]
*  We're an ambitious people, man. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7219.54s)]
*  Like laughable at times. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7221.139999999999s)]

*  Mexico City? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7778.259999999999s)]
*  Mexico City, but traveling around a little bit to other regions [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7778.82s)]

*  The Jim Cana of Italian food. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7791.86s)]
*  Enrique, I thought Enrique is a great Mexican restaurant. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7793.86s)]
*  Enrique, I thought Enrique is a really respected chef. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7797.54s)]
*  Legit, legit, legit. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7800.82s)]
*  I think Cosme is, I think they got one of the best desserts in the city. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7803.14s)]
*  Oh, the corn? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7806.5s)]
*  The horned cornhouse meringue. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7807.0599999999995s)]
*  It's incredible. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7808.18s)]
*  That's one of the best dishes in the world. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7809.54s)]
*  I mean, I'd put that in one of the 10 best dishes in the world. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7813.86s)]
*  Bro, that's another thing, like Mexico City specifically, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7816.26s)]
*  as just a world, I always say this, it's a world-class city. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7818.66s)]
*  You can't think of it any differently than you think of New York, Paris, Rome. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7822.34s)]
*  Especially when it comes to dining. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7827.14s)]
*  Like, Pujol, did you go to Pujol? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7828.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7829.94s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7830.74s)]
*  Pujol is incredible. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7831.46s)]
*  Contra Mar, Pujol, even like their old breakfast spots, like Cardinal, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7832.98s)]
*  like the old school Mexican breakfast spots, like the Cedales of Mexico City, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7838.82s)]
*  they're incredible. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7843.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7844.1s)]
*  Okay, best chocolate chip cookie in the city. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7844.82s)]
*  I don't know if I have an answer for that. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7849.22s)]
*  I don't know if I've done a lot of chocolate chip cookie research. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7851.3s)]
*  Are you a sweets guy? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7853.46s)]

*  I'm a sucker. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7856.1s)]
*  Italians are suckers for like sweet breakfasts. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7856.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know why, it's like they're a big pastry coffee culture. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7860.34s)]
*  So I think I'm a sucker for that stuff too. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7863.620000000001s)]
*  Like all things from donuts to like all things croissant, I love all that shit. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7865.860000000001s)]

*  Best bakery... [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7872.5s)]
*  They're talking my fat ass language. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7874.58s)]
*  Bakeries. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7877.54s)]
*  Is this hard since you know all these people? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7878.42s)]
*  Like, is it like asking us who the best comedians are? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7880.26s)]
*  No, there's a bakery in Brooklyn called Apartment 4F, that's great. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7883.7s)]
*  Oh, I've heard of this place. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7887.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7888.0199999999995s)]
*  They make some really incredible pastries and breads. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7888.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7891.46s)]
*  Balthazar's Bakery, I've always loved. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7892.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's fire. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7893.62s)]
*  Always loved that. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7894.66s)]
*  I love the old school donut shops like Peter Pan. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7895.62s)]
*  Oh, Peter Pan's great, yeah. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7898.0199999999995s)]
*  I love donuts. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7899.46s)]
*  I fucking love donuts. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7900.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7901.0599999999995s)]
*  If you were to go to an Italian restaurant, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7901.86s)]
*  you needed to judge the quality of the food with one dish. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7903.299999999999s)]
*  What would you order? [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7906.82s)]
*  Great question. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7907.379999999999s)]
*  I would order like a dry pasta. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7908.339999999999s)]
*  Not a fresh pasta, dry pasta. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7911.22s)]
*  It's trickier to make. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7912.740000000001s)]
*  So something like a spaghetti or penne rigatoni, a dry pasta, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7914.58s)]
*  cooked perfectly, cooked from scratch, al dente, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7919.860000000001s)]
*  sauce right. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7923.14s)]
*  It's trickier that it takes a certain touch [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7924.660000000001s)]
*  of someone that really knows what they're doing. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7928.26s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7929.780000000001s)]
*  Fresh pasta's easier, it's more forgiving. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7930.900000000001s)]
*  It's soft, it's luxurious, it only cooks in a few seconds. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7934.18s)]
*  It's good with just plain butter. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7938.42s)]
*  It's harder with a dry pasta, it's trickier. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7941.38s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7944.740000000001s)]
*  What is the thing on the menu at Carbone [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7946.02s)]
*  that you think people should order? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7951.3s)]
*  Like the thing you're most proud of that people aren't ordering as much as the spicy rig? [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7954.58s)]
*  Our pork chops. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7960.26s)]
*  We serve great pork chops, but because of the veal parm, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7961.780000000001s)]
*  I don't eat beef, so that's what I'll do. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7965.780000000001s)]
*  We serve a fantastic big thick cut pork chop with vinegar peppers, [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7968.26s)]
*  which is a classic Italian American dish that I order a lot when I'm there as a customer, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7974.02s)]
*  which is really important to be a customer, like to sit in the seat of a customer. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7982.02s)]
*  I get a whole different set of notes than I do when I'm in the kitchen, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7986.66s)]
*  but pork chop with vinegar peppers. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7990.02s)]
*  Great dish. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7993.22s)]
*  That's the one. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7994.1s)]
*  All right, what about it, Terese? [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7994.66s)]
*  A dish that doesn't get ordered that often. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=7996.74s)]
*  His menu is smaller. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8004.5s)]
*  He sells a lot of everything. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8005.78s)]
*  The duck, the duck at Terese. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8007.3s)]
*  He's a duck master. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8010.42s)]
*  We used to have, we should probably change it to his, but we used to have... [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8011.38s)]
*  So when we first opened Dirty French on the Lourie side, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8016.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8020.5s)]
*  Rich had developed a technique for cooking duck, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8021.0599999999995s)]
*  where the duck had to age for 30 days like beef. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8023.860000000001s)]
*  And what would happen was the skin got super dry and crispy when you cooked it, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8027.14s)]
*  but also it tenderizes the meat just like it does with beef. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8031.700000000001s)]
*  We were selling a lot of duck. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8035.700000000001s)]
*  We couldn't hold all the ducks we needed in the restaurant to age them for 30 days. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8036.900000000001s)]
*  So we rented an apartment across the street. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8042.02s)]
*  No way. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8045.700000000001s)]
*  On Ludlow, across the street from the restaurant, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8046.9800000000005s)]
*  and the landlord didn't care at all. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8050.820000000001s)]
*  Like, the landlord had no idea what we were doing. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8052.820000000001s)]
*  We just moved refrigerators. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8055.46s)]
*  There's no furniture. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8057.06s)]
*  It was just refrigerators in an apartment across the street on Ludlow Street [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8058.18s)]
*  and ducks hanging throughout the apartment, aging in this apartment. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8061.700000000001s)]
*  And then every day at four o'clock you'd see a cook come out [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8068.1s)]
*  with just a tray of ducks from this apartment into the restaurant. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8070.820000000001s)]
*  And it just sounds like a racist conspiracy. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8074.34s)]
*  These Chinese people are hiding ducks in apartments downtown. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8076.42s)]
*  Don't say that. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8080.9800000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8082.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's Rich D'Arisi. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8083.38s)]
*  How often are restaurants hacking the margins [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8085.22s)]
*  where you try to take an item that's going to sell well, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8087.46s)]
*  but it's also the cheapest to make, but you price it the highest? [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8089.9400000000005s)]
*  Or like they'll do this with wine sometimes. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8093.14s)]
*  Or sometimes they'll make like the cheapest wine [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8094.66s)]
*  or one of the cheaper wines more expensive to try to like create a psychological effect. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8096.34s)]
*  Have you heard about this? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8099.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like what movie theaters used to do [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8101.3s)]
*  where they charge a certain amount for the small coke and then the medium and the large. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8103.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8108.42s)]
*  Are you guys doing that with wine? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8109.54s)]
*  I mean, no, we're trying to apply a pretty, you don't apply like for us, for example, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8111.78s)]
*  we don't apply the same price structure to an expensive bottle of wine [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8117.0599999999995s)]
*  as you do to a less expensive bottle. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8122.26s)]
*  So you're generally you're looking at like a three time markup [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8124.0199999999995s)]
*  on a less expensive bottle of wine, $100 or less. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8127.3s)]
*  And then as it gets more and more expensive, the markup becomes smaller. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8130.34s)]
*  So like if it costs us $500, we're not charging $1500. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8134.5s)]
*  We're probably charging close to a thousand dollars on it. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8138.099999999999s)]
*  While a bottle that costs us 30 might we might charge 90. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8140.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8144.74s)]
*  So there's a greater threshold on a less expensive bottle [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8145.0599999999995s)]
*  than there is on a more expensive bottle. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8147.94s)]
*  Those margins are critical to the survival of a restaurant [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8151.3s)]
*  because at the end of the day, the final number at the bottom is generally a really small. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8154.42s)]
*  Everyone like if you know anything about restaurants, you know that it's [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8160.0199999999995s)]
*  they're generally going to close and that you don't make a ton of money. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8162.58s)]
*  So that money that's made in alcohol is critical to the life of a restaurant. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8165.3s)]
*  Also, it's as opposed to food, it's non-perishable. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8170.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8172.82s)]
*  Like if you fucked up and you ordered 40 ducks this week and only 20 people [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8173.0599999999995s)]
*  ordered the duck, like you're gambling on something that's very perishable. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8178.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8183.0599999999995s)]
*  Now you're eating it for staff meal and you lost money. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8183.3s)]
*  So it's a very fine dance with food and perishable items to get the number right [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8185.78s)]
*  so that they don't come to the table like, sorry, we're out of the duck tonight. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8190.9s)]
*  Or we eat it for staff meal. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8193.859999999999s)]
*  What's in between those two is like really knowing how to run this business. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8195.619999999999s)]
*  And it's a fine dance. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8199.859999999999s)]
*  If you're on a date with a girl, like let's say you've gone on a couple of days, [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8201.539999999999s)]
*  you get a reservation of Carbone, you really want to impress her. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8204.66s)]
*  Is there anything you can do internally to send like a message to really like blow her mind? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8206.9s)]
*  Like something with like dessert, but not like corny? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8212.1s)]
*  You want to send a message to her? [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8214.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8216.34s)]
*  If you want to like, you know, have a good experience. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8216.66s)]
*  I'm sure there's some people listening. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8219.619999999999s)]
*  Mark's never been on a fucking date. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8220.9s)]
*  I'm sure there's some people. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8222.18s)]
*  First girl he met. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8224.58s)]
*  I'm taking a Carbone. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8226.66s)]
*  I would go back to the implementing the bring a beer rule. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8227.619999999999s)]
*  Like you're going out on a date and you carry like this gift for the kitchen. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8230.66s)]
*  And then she wants to like, what are you doing? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8235.94s)]
*  Why you got like a 12 pack of Coors Light? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8238.1s)]
*  Like, oh no, it's a thing that we do for the guys. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8240.42s)]
*  And like that's going to put you in a position of like, who is this guy? [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8243.78s)]
*  He's a regular. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8247.859999999999s)]
*  He got a couple of reservations and he knows this place so well that he brought beers for the kitchen. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8248.66s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're going to start sending extras out, [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8253.06s)]
*  compliments of the chef. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8255.06s)]
*  Now you look pretty great. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8256.42s)]
*  So I would go back to that strategy. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8258.74s)]
*  Tell me about this F1 thing. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8261.779999999999s)]
*  F1 is our fourth year of doing it. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8264.66s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, Miami is at its like capacity that weekend. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8267.38s)]
*  The city's crazy. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8271.539999999999s)]
*  So the first year we were sort of like, okay, well, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8273.06s)]
*  if the restaurant's so full, maybe we can do something else. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8276.259999999998s)]
*  Like there's such a demand for this weekend. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8280.259999999998s)]
*  What can we do that's like over the top to meet the weekend? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8283.46s)]
*  So we kind of devised this idea of like throwing this like really elaborate [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8287.06s)]
*  supper club dinner party where there's a performance, there's house bands, Ricky sings. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8291.22s)]
*  He's part of- Ricky can sing? [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8296.82s)]

*  Okay, but tell me. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8320.98s)]
*  Do we have any sasheetos? [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8322.42s)]
*  We're going. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8324.5s)]
*  So there's like about 400 or 500 people that come. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8327.3s)]
*  We build this giant, amazing tent on the sand of Miami Beach. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8329.3s)]
*  There's a headlining performer every year. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8333.62s)]

*  On the actual sand, we build the kitchen, the whole thing. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8350.740000000002s)]
*  Friday, Saturday, Sunday night in conjunction with F1. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8353.300000000001s)]

*  Like royalty or like a like a sheik or something? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8530.1s)]
*  What's the weirdest request? [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8532.18s)]
*  Jay-Z's been to the restaurant. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8533.300000000001s)]
*  There's a good one. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8534.98s)]
*  We had Obama when he was still sitting president come in. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8536.42s)]
*  Wow. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8539.22s)]
*  Which was as you know. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8539.539999999999s)]
*  New York. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8540.5s)]
*  New York. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8540.98s)]
*  New York, yeah. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8541.38s)]
*  To have him as the sitting president. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8542.02s)]
*  Eat at the restaurant and the protocol that goes around that is bananas. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8544.5s)]
*  Okay, what's the protocol? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8548.42s)]
*  Well, I was the only I was one of the only people that knew about it. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8549.78s)]
*  So I was pretty convinced that they were watching my phone. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8552.5s)]
*  So I didn't tell anybody because it was an unannounced. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8555.06s)]
*  So that night it was unannounced. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8559.38s)]
*  So no one knew that he was supposed to be there. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8561.619999999999s)]
*  So at that point, Secret Service deems anyone that's in the restaurant to be safe [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8564.26s)]
*  because they don't know it's happening. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8568.34s)]
*  So they don't they don't they don't need to check that, right? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8570.34s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8572.66s)]
*  So the second that he shows up then then then they go full. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8573.22s)]
*  They shut down all communication. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8577.7s)]
*  All phones stopped working. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8579.62s)]
*  They set up a metal detector outside. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8581.22s)]
*  Someone someone goes to every exit downstairs throughout. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8583.22s)]
*  There's someone in the kitchen with me. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8586.18s)]
*  And immediately the second he walks in and then things sort of shut down. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8589.22s)]
*  But it was amazing. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8593.3s)]
*  He walked in the place went absolutely bananas. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8594.179999999998s)]
*  And so to have him there as the sitting president of the United States, [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8598.099999999999s)]
*  and he's been back since. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8602.58s)]
*  But like to have him there that night was pretty unbelievable. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8603.539999999999s)]
*  Does he order or does he say, give me your best hits? [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8606.42s)]
*  We they ordered for the someone at the table ordered for everybody. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8611.939999999999s)]
*  And he ordered his drink, which was a dirty, dirty. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8615.699999999999s)]
*  I think he's a dirty gin martini. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8619.46s)]
*  So all the only thing he ordered was his cocktail, but everything else just came out. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8623.46s)]
*  So you you does he speak on any of the dishes? [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8626.58s)]
*  I went to the table. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8631.06s)]
*  I said hi to him. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8631.859999999999s)]
*  He's unreasonably cool for president of the United States. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8633.539999999999s)]
*  He got up at the end of the night. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8637.539999999999s)]
*  He kind of addressed everybody in the crowd, which is amazing. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8638.74s)]
*  Where do you see them in the restaurant? [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8642.34s)]
*  We have one table in the back that's like talk to the left. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8644.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's all the way up so that you know, the most unbothered of all the locations. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8647.38s)]
*  But when he stands up, he knows that everybody's looking at him. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8653.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8657.619999999999s)]
*  It's like standing ovation like every night for dinner. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8658.019999999999s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8661.539999999999s)]
*  I was at the comedy cellar once and like Madonna was upstairs. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8662.9s)]
*  She actually went on stage and did some comedy I didn't watch, but she was upstairs. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8666.099999999999s)]
*  And it was like a very weird experience because the gravitational pull to her, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8669.38s)]
*  like any conversation you and I would be having was a pretend conversation as we like through [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8674.98s)]
*  the side of our eye watched Madonna. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8681.14s)]
*  And the fact that he would get up and just acknowledge that I think is quite honorable. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8684.5s)]
*  It's the most authentic thing you can do because you know everybody's [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8689.939999999999s)]
*  fucking staring at you the entire time. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8692.58s)]
*  You finish like everyone can have a look. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8693.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8695.539999999999s)]
*  Then I'll leave. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8695.859999999999s)]
*  Does someone taste Obama's food? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8696.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8698.42s)]
*  There was a person in the kitchen that all they, you know, they have like a whole [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8699.619999999999s)]
*  like kit with them, a giant briefcase. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8704.42s)]
*  And all that they asked of me that night was to let them know when we were preparing his food. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8707.46s)]
*  And he got real close to kind of the preparation of it. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8712.02s)]
*  But I don't remember them like tasting it ahead of time. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8714.34s)]
*  I thought they were going to. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8716.82s)]
*  That briefcase is doing something. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8717.94s)]
*  There's like a whole, yeah, there's a whole kit of something in that briefcase that never came out. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8719.46s)]
*  Did Daniel Balloud ever congratulate you, validate you, give you your flowers? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8724.98s)]
*  Was there ever a moment that he had with you that was really important to you? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8733.38s)]
*  Well, we're very close now still, which is great with Danielle and John George. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8738.34s)]
*  Danielle. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8743.14s)]
*  You know, it's important for Rich and I that we're close with that generation because they [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8745.619999999999s)]
*  were our heroes and they're still operating at a really high level, which is amazing. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8750.26s)]
*  Rich was even closer to Danielle because he had worked there for far more years than I had. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8755.86s)]
*  So that relationship is really important to him, but it's important to me as well. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8762.42s)]
*  He definitely gives us our flowers as does J.G., John George. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8765.62s)]
*  And I think that that relationship means the world to us because those coming up, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8769.62s)]
*  reading the review every Wednesday in the New York Times as kids to see who got reviewed [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8776.02s)]
*  and to see their names and to eventually work with them and now to be their kind of colleagues and [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8781.78s)]

*  Have you ever had a personal moment with him where he's like, hey, I'm really proud of you, [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8788.26s)]
*  or even Mario, any of these people you've ever met? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8791.86s)]
*  I mean, I've had a lot of moments with Mario. I spent a lot of years with Mario. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8794.42s)]
*  I've had moments with Danielle telling him that story about the resume and having that moment [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8798.58s)]
*  with him where I get to tell him that story. What did he say? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8804.26s)]
*  He doesn't remember it, but he loves that that happened. He loves that we're alumni. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8807.86s)]
*  That means a lot to him. So to see the pride that we came from his kitchen, that we made it, [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8813.7s)]
*  is the greatest possible reward for us. That goes back to that. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8820.980000000001s)]
*  We made it in New York and that was the biggest thing we could have ever imagined. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8825.380000000001s)]
*  I never thought about a restaurant in Hong Kong. I just wanted to be big here. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8829.380000000001s)]
*  And then ask real quick. And then with Rich specifically, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8834.900000000001s)]
*  in you have to have an ego to be a chef, but you and Rich seemingly have navigated the fact that [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8838.58s)]
*  you both have a lot of ambition and egos and have built this incredible company. Maybe with [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8845.380000000001s)]
*  Zelinsky, he did a little bit or whatever. We love you, Jeff. But a lot of times bands break up. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8851.300000000001s)]
*  You guys have done this thing. I imagine there's been difficult times, but has there ever been any [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8861.380000000001s)]
*  reflection where you both look back and you're like, holy shit, we both got big egos. We're [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8866.18s)]
*  really ambitious. We're really confident, but we managed to stick together and build out this [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8869.94s)]
*  amazing company. Do you talk about that ever? We talk about it from time to time for sure. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8874.34s)]
*  There's definitely moments, especially because you're creating something, so you're sensitive [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8878.9s)]
*  to it. So when we're criticizing each other for the betterment of whatever that thing is, [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8882.58s)]
*  you can't help but get emotional about it. I made that, so I'm sensitive to it. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8889.460000000001s)]
*  That still happens today. I think the confidence that we have in that whole, like the band's not [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8894.019999999999s)]
*  going to break up thing is that, especially with Rich, I've known him my whole life. I've known [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8899.06s)]
*  since I was a kid, since we're teenagers. So we know that if we're fighting about something or [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8904.74s)]
*  we're not agreeing or butting heads about something, that it's just like when you're doing that with [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8910.74s)]
*  your actual brother. You built a friendship before the business. You're not going to break up with [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8914.5s)]
*  your brother. You're going to fight with him, you're going to call him a dick and something's [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8918.82s)]
*  going to happen. And then tomorrow's going to be tomorrow because that's your brother and he's [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8921.94s)]
*  going to be there. You're not going to break up with your sibling. So I think that that's what we [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8925.140000000001s)]
*  have. And it's never going to get so blown out of proportion that this whole thing is going to be a [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8929.060000000001s)]
*  house of cards. I will say one thing on the menu, we were talking about the sneak things [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8934.5s)]
*  on that Teresa menu, the zeppoles. Zeppole and ham. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8940.58s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. And it's like a pineapple. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8943.460000000001s)]
*  Pineapple. Yeah. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8946.42s)]
*  You get the avocado. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like the shaved part of it. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8948.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. But as much shit as we get from that zeppole thing. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8952.98s)]
*  I get it every time I go. It's fun. That I think that's really cool. I think it's easy when people [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8956.58s)]
*  get successful to kind of rupture, break up or whatever. I think it's something that like, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8961.3s)]
*  not saying that we've achieved your guys success, but like it's something that is important to us [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8967.38s)]
*  to like maintain. Like the friendship comes first. Something that Akash always reminds us every [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8971.22s)]
*  single time that there's any kind of confrontations. Like, why do we do this? Because we're friends. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8975.54s)]
*  The confrontation is good. Yeah, we should bump heads. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8979.300000000001s)]
*  The confrontation is good. Yeah. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8981.86s)]
*  If you guys just agree with each other all the time, then like, what are we doing? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8983.380000000001s)]
*  What are you doing? Right? Like you want to have people that are challenging you [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8986.740000000002s)]
*  and you're going to be sensitive about it. You like made this, you made this thing, you wrote that. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8990.580000000002s)]
*  That was my joke. Or I, that was my idea. Like you got to just acknowledge that, that we're all [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=8994.740000000002s)]
*  creatives and we're sensitive artists and you know, at our core, but it's not going to, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9000.26s)]
*  it's not going to break us. This is, this is the whole point is that we're going to make each other [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9006.58s)]
*  better. We're the, we're the, we're the, some of our parts are going to be greater than us as an [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9010.26s)]
*  individual. Okay. Before we get out of here, why is New York City the greatest city in the world? [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9013.62s)]
*  I mean, there's just not another city that looks like this, right? There's not another city that [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9019.22s)]
*  looks like New York. I think for those that, for those that sort of complain about the classic [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9025.38s)]
*  New York isn't what it was, I think you're misunderstanding the point of New York. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9034.98s)]
*  New York's job is to change. Exactly what he's saying. I say this all the time. New York's job [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9040.9s)]
*  there's a generation of 18, 19, 20 year olds that are getting their first taste of New York. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9050.179999999998s)]
*  It's the great, it's the great tournament of New York. Like how long are you going to be here? How [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9055.22s)]
*  long, how many rounds are you going to make? It's here to be the great editor. There's so much to [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9061.86s)]
*  learn from this place. New York is not the one that our parents remember. It's not the one from [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9069.46s)]
*  my grandparents when they came from LSI. It's not the one from our childhood. That's what makes New [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9076.9s)]
*  York great. It's malleable. It's here for the next generation. It's going to challenge the next [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9082.98s)]
*  one. And for those that are still here, right? It's the great tournament of life that is Manhattan [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9087.779999999999s)]
*  or New York City. Yeah. Do you still look here? I do not still look here. Before we go. Before we [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9092.74s)]
*  go. That's my camera. As you were, I don't want to say given opportunities, but earned opportunities [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9101.22s)]
*  from these great chefs. Are there any young creative chefs that you're seeing right now in [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9107.3s)]
*  New York City that we can shine a light on? I think it's important to us, definitely as New Yorkers [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9113.22s)]
*  to shine a light on young comedians that are coming up in New York, but also any industry for some of [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9116.98s)]
*  that we bring on the podcast. Are there any young restaurateurs out here that you really believe in? [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9121.619999999999s)]
*  People you're seeing with Promise. Yeah. It's hard when the financial world is in a questionable [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9125.859999999999s)]
*  place, right? It's hard for young aspiring restaurateurs or any industry to get the [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9130.82s)]
*  backing in a shaky financial moment to do something. So in times like this, you're going to see less [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9139.46s)]
*  creativity because it's too risky. You're going to see more status quo. You're going to see more [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9147.14s)]
*  safe plays. You're going to see people taking chances when it's safer to take chances. When [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9154.74s)]
*  money's cheap. When the economy's healthy and money is cheap and there's investors out there [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9161.06s)]
*  looking to take chances on you. So it's a tough time for that generation. Like it was for us, [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9165.14s)]
*  coming out of 08. There's not a lot of us that are going to get that break and we had to do [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9171.619999999999s)]
*  crazy shit to get those six tables. So I'm here for those who are out there, who are challenging, [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9176.74s)]
*  guys like Kwame, Tatiana who are doing incredible work right now. It's a tough time, man. It's a [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9184.42s)]
*  tough time to take a chance. Any other little guys. It could be the tiny, it could be six tables. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9191.380000000001s)]
*  Like anybody that you've seen, tasted recently. I mean, industry, I remember when industry was [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9196.1s)]
*  just starting, right? These two guys who looked and felt a lot like me and Rich when we first [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9199.94s)]
*  got to that pizzeria. But you see it in their eyes. It's like Tony Montana, man. Like it's the eyes, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9204.580000000002s)]
*  man. Like you can see that that guy, they're going to make it, man. I don't care. Like there [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9210.82s)]
*  was that guy that was making pizza. I think Chrissy's pizza or something in the oven in his [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9216.82s)]
*  apartment. Oh, in Brooklyn. Yeah. I think Chrissy's pizza. Yeah. Similar vibe. I assume. You're not [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9220.5s)]
*  going to tell them, no. They're going to figure it out. They're going to make it through it. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9225.94s)]
*  Are tariffs affecting the restaurant industry at all? They're going to. Yeah. I mean, we're [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9231.06s)]
*  just starting to see it, but it's going to. And I think that its greatest effect is going to be in [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9234.74s)]
*  cost to the customer. It's going to get passed on, right? I think certainly for us, like [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9242.66s)]
*  if my options are choose a lesser ingredient than what I'm accustomed to bringing in because it's [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9250.5s)]
*  too expensive or bring that ingredient in at the additional cost and pass it on to the customer. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9258.98s)]
*  We're going to choose that one, right? Because I feel like I've made a promise to my customers [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9265.06s)]
*  to give them the best ingredients in the world. And if I'm saying that I need that, [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9270.34s)]
*  I'm not going to choose something else. So it's going to get passed on to them. Unfortunately, [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9274.9s)]
*  right? I think that's where it's going to manifest itself is in rising costs to customers. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9279.38s)]
*  Okay. Last one. Italian American. You put a spotlight on Italian American cuisine, as you said. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9284.58s)]
*  It becomes one of the most successful restaurants in the world. I'm not even talking about [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9293.060000000001s)]
*  financially, but in terms of notoriety, is there like a moment where you kind of like look back [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9300.18s)]
*  and you feel this sense of pride in your culture? You know, this is you're doing like a salt. This [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9304.820000000002s)]
*  is a sauce joint that now is being mentioned in Drake songs. What does that kind of feel like? [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9310.58s)]
*  Do you feel the community? Are they supportive of it? Are they happy of it? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9315.54s)]
*  I feel like it is a function. I feel like Carbone is a functioning museum, right? I think that it's [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9320.42s)]
*  Italian Americans, not dissimilar to any sort of other immigrant path, right? The whole point of [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9328.18s)]
*  this journey, if you follow it back to your ancestors, my ancestors from Southern Italy, [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9337.46s)]
*  leaving a place to come to the United States for the betterment of the next generation, right? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9341.859999999999s)]
*  The entire point of the experiment was for us to assimilate into just becoming Americans and to [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9346.5s)]
*  eventually become less and less Italian. As each generation passes, you become just Americans. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9353.22s)]
*  That was the whole point of this assimilation. To me, for community, for what we're doing, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9358.419999999998s)]
*  what I'm leaving behind, I have great pride in that Carbone stands as a nightly functioning museum [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9365.86s)]
*  that you can go to, you can visit, you can consume. What was the wooly mammoth that is the [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9373.7s)]
*  Italian American in New York in 1950s? Because my children will be less Italian than I am, as I am [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9379.380000000001s)]
*  less Italian than my parents are. And that's the point. When you lament the fact that there are no [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9385.300000000001s)]
*  Italians in Little Italy, you are also proving the point of what the purpose of that was. They [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9390.1s)]
*  weren't supposed to stay here. They were supposed to just become Americans. That's why they left [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9394.9s)]
*  their country. So when it was at its most potent, and I chose that period, the first generation of [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MGiRLFoAM&t=9399.06s)]
