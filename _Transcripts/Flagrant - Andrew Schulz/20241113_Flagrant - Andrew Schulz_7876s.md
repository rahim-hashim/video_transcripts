*  Only the people were able to buy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=138.24s)]
*  the foundation series cyber truck, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=140.24s)]
*  which is $100,000, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=141.84s)]

*  I'm like, what the hell is this woman doing? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=258.4s)]
*  I figured that's why you just went to Paris. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=260.56s)]
*  Say again? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  I figured that's why you just went to Paris. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=262.88s)]
*  I did that to avoid everything else. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=264.4s)]
*  I did that because there wasn't enough family drama. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=268.4s)]
*  That's why I went. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=272.8s)]
*  Every time shit is too good in the family, I'm like, why don't we take a trip and see [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=274.71999999999997s)]

*  How do I start the pot? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=283.52s)]
*  One of the things that's crazy, it's actually shocking to me, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=284.88s)]
*  is how well women get along with their in-laws. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=287.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=290.64s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  It's just like, dude, the power. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=292.24s)]
*  Why can't we do it? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=293.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=294.8s)]
*  I wish, dude. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  What's wrong with men? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=296.24s)]
*  They really are the fairest sex. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=297.04s)]
*  They really are the fairest sex. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=298.24s)]
*  What's wrong with men in Donald Trump's America that we can't just get along with our in-laws? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  But these women do it swimmingly. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=304.16s)]
*  They are the change they want to see in the world. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  They truly are the change. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=309.44s)]
*  It really goes to show you that men really cause all the problems. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=310.8s)]
*  We do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=313.92s)]
*  Because when we're hanging out with the relatives, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=314.48s)]
*  there's beef nonstop. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=316.64s)]
*  But when they… [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=317.84s)]
*  We really just take the smallest slight and make a big deal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  And then we bring it up to our spouses later and make them get involved. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=325.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=326.08s)]
*  Why do we do that? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  I think the reason we do it is so we can add two to three more podcasts a week. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=327.52s)]
*  You think Kamala's in-laws voted for her? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=333.76s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=335.76s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=336.4s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=338.24s)]
*  You don't think they voted? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=339.2s)]
*  No. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=340.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, they're Jewish, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=340.8s)]
*  They went mag all the way, dude. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, they were voting for Donald J. Trump. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=343.12s)]
*  So here's a thing that I need to just point out that I think is very important. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=345.76s)]
*  Mark brought this to my attention, but also social media and TikTok did. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=349.68s)]
*  I did not know that you could get payouts to do interviews with presidential candidates. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=353.92s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  Here we go, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=362.08s)]
*  Innocently spending our own money to create beautiful sets. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=364.4s)]
*  Tens of thousands of dollars to create beautiful sets. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=368.48s)]
*  Hiring stinky Russians. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=372.48s)]
*  Hiring smelly Russian women. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=374.16s)]
*  Listen, I never felt more bad for Ukraine. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  I go, if this what y'all got to do? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=384.32000000000005s)]
*  This what y'all got to do on a daily basis? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=387.04s)]
*  Chemical warfare. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=389.04s)]
*  Oh, bringing the drones. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  I have to apologize to Mark. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm like, Mark, he's the former president, bro. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=392.48s)]
*  And then when it was her, I was like, my bad. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=395.92s)]
*  And Trump married one. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=398.88s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=399.92s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=401.04s)]
*  This is, listen, that's a ballsy guy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  Point is, point is, we dealt with the smell of that Russian. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay, we spent tens of thousands of dollars to create a beautiful set to respect the future [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=411.12s)]
*  president, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  We reach out to Kamala, we're willing to do the exact same thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  We're reaching out to, and we're reaching out to Bill Clinton. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=420.64s)]
*  We're willing to do the exact same thing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=423.12s)]
*  We'll travel to you, we'll spend our own money. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  We'll spend our own, we didn't even know that you could hit them up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=425.52s)]
*  Lo and behold, all these celebrities that did interviews with them are getting paid [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=429.36s)]
*  millions of dollars. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=433.92s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=435.12s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=436.48s)]
*  Thank you, Mark. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, we're the bad guys. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=438.24s)]
*  We're the bad guys for platforming the current president at the time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=440.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=444.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=444.72s)]
*  But these celebrities, former and current. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=445.76s)]
*  These celebrities whose votes are for sale get no criticism? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=447.6s)]
*  That's a little peculiar. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=452.72s)]
*  Isn't that a little peculiar? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=456.88s)]
*  A little bit peculiar. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=458.24s)]
*  I mean, twerking for Kamala cost three million dollars? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=460.56s)]
*  When we would have done it for a couple thousand. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=464.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=466.16s)]
*  Yo, if all it took was for us to wear the tight spandex and you see that mousse and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=466.88s)]
*  we shake that ass and make your toes clap, if that's all it took and we get three million. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=472.64s)]
*  Al, you know how many cyber trucks you could buy for three million dollars? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=479.36s)]
*  Al, think about, you didn't get a cyber truck. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=483.04s)]
*  You didn't get a cyber truck. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=485.36s)]
*  You didn't get a cyber truck. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=486.32s)]
*  How much did she get paid? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=487.52s)]
*  Oprah got paid two. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=488.48s)]
*  Apparently, Oprah got the million. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=489.44s)]
*  Now she's saying, all I'm trying to say is if you really. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=490.88s)]
*  So you're saying Trump ain't paying nobody? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=493.68s)]
*  We didn't get paid. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=495.76s)]
*  Not, we're bad at business. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=496.48s)]
*  Y'all didn't ask. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=497.44s)]
*  Or maybe Mark did. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=498.32s)]
*  Can I give a little respect to Dove? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=499.36s)]
*  The second that image came out with how much money they paid out all the celebs to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=503.2s)]
*  pretend to endorse Kamala. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=508.24s)]
*  I mean, Dove hit up our connect over at the Trump team. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=511.6s)]
*  Alex. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=515.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=515.84s)]
*  Alex Bruce, I don't know how to pronounce his last fucking Polish as any, but he's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=516.32s)]
*  the real guy that's connecting to all the podcasts. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=520.88s)]
*  I know Baron is getting a lot of credit for it right now. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=522.6400000000001s)]
*  We never spoke to Baron. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=524.48s)]
*  I have no fucking clue. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=525.6s)]
*  But Alex is the one that was doing all the work to connect all the podcasts. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  Well done with Alex. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  Almost lost the election getting Tony to go up there and do a vote. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=531.2s)]
*  So that was it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=534.72s)]
*  And I knew that he was the one that pitched the idea because as the results were coming [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=535.7600000000001s)]
*  in and Puerto Ricans were voting for Trump, he was like, I told you it wasn't going to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=539.12s)]
*  be an issue. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=541.7600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, he goes, he immediately texts the group and he goes, Hey, I just want to let [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=542.24s)]
*  you know we didn't know that we could hit y'all up for money for this and for production [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=550.64s)]
*  costs. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=556.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=556.48s)]
*  And he goes, and we looked at the numbers, you guys raised 384 billion. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=557.04s)]
*  You only spent 351. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=560.32s)]
*  So it looks like you got a little bit of extra. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=561.92s)]
*  I love that time to throw it back to the bulls. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=564.16s)]
*  I love that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=566.48s)]
*  Or just when he runs for his third term, we just get it then. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=567.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's a good idea. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=570.08s)]
*  When Trump goes to the third term, roll over minutes. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=571.52s)]
*  Yeah, have you heard this one where maybe it was you that brought this up when we were [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  sitting down, but if he goes for the third term, do the Dems bring Barack for the third [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=580.4s)]
*  term? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  Son, that's it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=586.64s)]
*  That's Floyd versus Pacquiao. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=588.0799999999999s)]
*  That's what we want to see. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=589.6s)]
*  Everything's wrestling, bro. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=595.84s)]
*  We just want a good matchup. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=596.96s)]
*  We just want a good matchup. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=598.0s)]
*  Do you care more about term limits or matchups? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=600.48s)]
*  I want matchups, baby. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=602.32s)]
*  After we fix all this nonsense, I want matchups. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=605.36s)]
*  Election mania. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=607.76s)]
*  I think we should, dude, since everything is wrestling, maybe we should take a little [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=608.64s)]
*  time and help the Democrats understand the wrestling of their party. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  Because I think Republicans understand the wrestling of their party. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=616.88s)]
*  Oh, they sure do. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=619.44s)]
*  They really get the wrestling more than anything. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=620.48s)]
*  It's probably the most important thing to them is the wrestling. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  We'd like maybe a little bit more focus on policy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=626.4s)]
*  I mean, but they get it so much, they got Hulk Hogan up there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  They get it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=631.68s)]
*  There's a moment, I hope you guys can bring this up. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=633.92s)]
*  This shit cracked me up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=635.68s)]
*  RFK is on, shout out to RFK. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=637.28s)]
*  He's a real one, bro. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=639.76s)]
*  This motherfucker is like, you know, he's like Mariah the scientist to Donald Trump. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=640.72s)]
*  He's riding for Donald Trump. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=651.36s)]
*  So he's on Tucker Carlson's pot. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=653.12s)]
*  I don't know if somehow it brings up geopolitics. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=656.4000000000001s)]
*  Tucker's like, yeah, so what do you think about Donald Trump? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=659.2800000000001s)]
*  And then RFK goes, I remember I was on a plane with him and he was telling me about [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=661.5200000000001s)]
*  the Middle East and he brought out a napkin and he drew a map of the Middle East and told [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=668.8800000000001s)]
*  me the number of troops we had in each one of these locations in the Middle East. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=675.9200000000001s)]
*  Tucker goes, wait, are you telling me that Donald Trump drew a map of the Middle East [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  from memory? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=686.24s)]
*  He goes, yeah, from memory. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=686.88s)]
*  Tucker just goes, but you need that kind of ride or die wrestling in order to push the agenda. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  So do we help the Dems? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=699.2s)]
*  That's what we call it out, ride or die wrestling or ultimate dick sucking. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=701.2s)]
*  You need someone to completely lie. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=705.84s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=707.12s)]
*  Go, go watch that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=708.24s)]
*  Make sure I got this right. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=709.2s)]
*  Trump on the plane the other day drew a map of the Middle East. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=710.24s)]
*  An accurate map? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=714.32s)]
*  An accurate map of the Middle East. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=715.6s)]
*  With troop strength? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, with troop strength in each of the nations. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, I saw that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  Even Tucker, who is the man who's formed the American could have kept that shit out, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=729.84s)]
*  but he's like, no, it's too crazy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=736.0s)]
*  I came out here trying to unvaccinate us. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=739.2s)]
*  I should have left that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=741.12s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, OK, so. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  The wrestling for Democrats. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  So, OK, what is most important? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=750.0s)]
*  Because I think the goal for most sane Americans is we have two options for president every [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  single election and they're both awesome. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=761.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=763.6s)]
*  And it's really tricky which one we have to go for. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  And, you know, that's how you know that we're in a pretty good situation. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=767.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=772.64s)]
*  I think that's the ideal. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=772.88s)]
*  That's the dream. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=773.68s)]
*  We're not so tribal that we're just like, oh, fuck Democrats or fuck Republicans. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=774.56s)]
*  We would like two people who are really speaking to the things that are bothering us [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=778.16s)]
*  and they're going to go satisfy those things. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=782.2399999999999s)]
*  Fair enough? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=783.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=784.56s)]
*  How do we do that? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=785.3599999999999s)]
*  Obviously, the election showed that Democrats are a little bit off from what the majority [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=787.3599999999999s)]
*  of people want. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=791.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, their policies might actually satisfy what those people want. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  They might have good policies for working class people. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=798.0s)]
*  They might have good policies for labor. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=800.56s)]
*  They might have good policies for they might even have good policies for the border. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=802.64s)]
*  I don't even fucking know what their border thing is. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=806.0s)]
*  I thought that their messaging was horrible, but their messaging has one, been horrible [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=807.76s)]
*  and two, the perception of them is atrocious. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=811.68s)]
*  This is where we get into the wrestling. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  So let's just have a very honest discussion. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=817.84s)]
*  What is the perception of the Democratic Party right now? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  Identity politics. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=826.08s)]
*  Leftists have taken over. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=827.6s)]
*  They don't care about any working everyday American. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=829.68s)]
*  They only care about these kind of fringe groups. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=832.24s)]
*  That's the perception. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=834.16s)]
*  Would you guys say that that's part of it? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=835.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's definitely part of it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=839.6s)]
*  I also think they're not addressing the things people care about the most and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=841.28s)]
*  not trying to separate that just took me to fuck off. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=848.08s)]
*  Yeah, like what's that thing right there? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=851.12s)]
*  What's that thing that's on the screen? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=853.12s)]
*  How do you keep talking with that? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=855.12s)]
*  Why is she in a scarf? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=857.12s)]
*  Look at that neck. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  That's warm. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=858.88s)]
*  I think they were great as the bad guy in Monsters, Inc. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  I thought they were awesome. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=863.12s)]
*  That's the secretary of health. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=865.12s)]
*  That's the secretary of health. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=867.12s)]
*  The problem they didn't separate, well, Kamala didn't separate herself from Biden's four years. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=869.12s)]
*  And I think with now a break, they'll have a fresh start over next time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=875.52s)]
*  Just what's the perception? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=881.28s)]
*  Yeah, let's just go off of perception. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  Not what they are. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=884.24s)]
*  Not what the policies are because unfortunately in politics and in life, like for example, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=886.96s)]
*  and I said this when we were having a meeting the other day, like there are people who know [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=891.84s)]
*  nothing about us. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=894.8s)]
*  They see Donald Trump on our pod and they're like, oh, they're a right wing podcast. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=895.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=898.72s)]
*  I have to live with that perception. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=899.92s)]
*  You guys have to live with that perception from people who don't really know what we're [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=901.92s)]
*  about. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=905.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=906.16s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunate. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=906.64s)]
*  So and that is the cost. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  And then we can decide to address that or we can decide to just keep on making content. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=909.68s)]
*  It's up to us. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=913.36s)]
*  What I think is there is a disconnect between what the Democrats think they are and how the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  American public perceives them. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=920.24s)]
*  Perceives them. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=922.0s)]
*  And perception is so strong, to use his personal, there's people who know me who are like, oh, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=922.64s)]
*  you're a right wing bubble. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=926.8s)]
*  I'm like, you know me pretty well. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=927.76s)]
*  I would think you know me better than that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=929.5999999999999s)]
*  But perception is so powerful. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=930.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter how much I know about you personally, even then. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=932.8s)]
*  So Democrats perception. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=936.0s)]
*  I'm more extreme than Magda. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=942.0799999999999s)]

*  But the perception. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=952.4s)]
*  So that's our point is people like John Stewart had a great piece about what the liberals [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=953.28s)]
*  actually are. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=958.4799999999999s)]

*  But you hit it perfectly. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=961.8399999999999s)]
*  The perception is not what even if reality is this, the perception is it's leftist. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  It's libs of TikTok people. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=969.4399999999999s)]

*  It's he. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1255.04s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1255.84s)]
*  What is it? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1257.04s)]
*  What does he identify as? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1259.6s)]
*  Again. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1260.0s)]
*  So perfect example, right? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1261.44s)]
*  So it's just the party of, it's like the drag queen comes in to like read books to the kids [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1262.72s)]
*  and the dad who works like in construction goes, man, what happened today? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1268.08s)]
*  Yeah, a guy dressed in makeup came in and read books to us. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1272.56s)]
*  And he goes, what's up with the drag queen reading with books to the kids? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1275.92s)]
*  And then the school goes, oh, I'm sorry. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1280.0800000000002s)]
*  You trying to raise a bigot that's not accepting of the dragon? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1282.16s)]
*  What the fuck is a drag queen reading to the kids for? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1284.72s)]
*  You have to go, oh, no, it's actually not a drag queen. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1288.5600000000002s)]
*  We had different versions of clowns coming in and one clown. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  It's more of a clown thing. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1299.04s)]
*  And we thought the clowns are kind of funny. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1300.3200000000002s)]
*  And then the dad goes, oh, I like clowns. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1301.76s)]
*  Okay, that's fine. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1303.28s)]
*  You can't immediately slap the person in the face for asking a question why you're being weird. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1304.64s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of people are voting against, which is we got to stop [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1311.2s)]
*  pretending we're not being weird over here. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1318.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1320.48s)]
*  And I think it's going to take Democrats acknowledging, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1321.12s)]
*  at least acknowledging, hey, we're the party of like acceptance. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1325.84s)]
*  But sometimes we're accepting things that are a little out there for people. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1330.0s)]
*  So let's do a little explaining. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1333.28s)]
*  Also, Donald Trump put that on the part. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1334.48s)]
*  I sent this ad to the group when I first saw it as the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1336.3999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is for you, Kamala is for they them. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1338.8s)]
*  Bars. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1341.6s)]
*  What a fucking ad. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1342.16s)]
*  And it's got Charlamagne, who's openly a Kamala supporter being like, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1343.36s)]
*  saying Kamala wants to support surgery for prisoners. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1347.92s)]
*  But I'm not into that. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1351.12s)]
*  Then Kamala saying, yeah, I want to do that. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1352.6399999999999s)]
*  Saying your pronouns before I ask you is like weird. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1354.8s)]
*  Has that ever happened? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1358.56s)]
*  It's just weird. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1359.6s)]
*  That you're just being weird. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1360.32s)]
*  I agree. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1361.36s)]
*  I agree. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1361.92s)]
*  That was you admit you didn't like that haircut that you had. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1362.4s)]
*  That was a version of the dick on the head. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1368.0s)]
*  But to anybody that said, you know, your haircut's stupid. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  I go, yeah, I know it's stupid. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1373.2s)]
*  No, you said you liked it at first. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1374.72s)]
*  You said you liked it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1377.8400000000001s)]
*  But me liking it doesn't mean that I don't acknowledge how absurd it is. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1378.88s)]
*  So I see what you're saying. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1382.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1383.52s)]
*  I've never heard you acknowledging it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1384.3200000000002s)]
*  Imagine he goes, I'd be on stage. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  What, you don't like this haircut? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1386.72s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you, you dickhead? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1387.6000000000001s)]
*  What, you don't like his hair? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1389.2s)]
*  What's your problem? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1390.0800000000002s)]
*  Stop. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1390.96s)]
*  Now you say it's a shit and you pretend he was going to start a trend. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1392.08s)]
*  And then anytime someone does it, he still takes credit for it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1394.8s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1396.88s)]
*  But that's different than you're fucked. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1397.44s)]
*  I understand the point you're making. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  But for me, when I was on stage, I would make jokes about it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1402.16s)]
*  I said I looked like Kim Jong, January 6. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1405.44s)]
*  I would just make absurd jokes about myself and how stupid I looked with it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1409.6000000000001s)]
*  So I was aware of how ridiculous it was. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  And there was a part of me that likes trolling people. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1416.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1419.76s)]
*  But then when I saw other people starting to do it, I was like, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1420.56s)]
*  oh, you better keep that same energy when Ronaldo does it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1424.32s)]
*  If you make fun of me with it, and then when Ronaldo does it, now it's cool, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1427.36s)]
*  or Kid Super did it, now it's cool, then I'm going to be like, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1430.72s)]
*  yo, keep the same energy. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1434.72s)]
*  But I- [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1435.76s)]
*  So to your point, that is you acknowledge that it's weird? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1436.32s)]
*  I did the weird dumb thing. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1438.56s)]
*  Maybe I like weird dumb shit. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1440.48s)]
*  And maybe people like being weird. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1441.84s)]
*  That's totally fine. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1443.28s)]
*  But I can at least acknowledge anybody that was like- [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1444.24s)]
*  If Dick on the Head guy from his earlier hypothetical just goes, I'm weird. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1447.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's so funny. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1450.8s)]
*  You'd be like, all right, today you know. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1452.96s)]
*  You know, it's so funny. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't even need to do Dick on the Head. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1454.48s)]
*  I could have done my haircut. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1455.84s)]
*  That example was perfectly weird. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1456.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1458.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's how normalized that haircut was. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1460.08s)]
*  But that was essentially wearing a dick on my head for a year and a half. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1463.76s)]
*  So you did. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1466.72s)]
*  But good example, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1469.2s)]
*  And how annoying would I be if I was like, oh, what, you just don't know fashion? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1470.24s)]
*  That's the Dems, essentially. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1475.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1476.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1477.28s)]
*  I get it. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1477.9199999999998s)]
*  Most furries, probably Democrats. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1479.2s)]
*  Furries. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1481.2s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1481.76s)]
*  You'd be a furry. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1482.24s)]
*  Be a furry. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1482.96s)]
*  But you're probably a Democrat. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1483.76s)]
*  Most furries are Democrats. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1485.44s)]
*  What about war reenactment motherfuckers? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1486.56s)]
*  Oh, that's not a furry. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1488.96s)]
*  That's gotta be Republican. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1490.1599999999999s)]
*  That's gotta be Republican. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1491.12s)]
*  Yeah, but that's weird shit that they don't acknowledge that's weird shit. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1492.0s)]
*  Yeah, but if they don't pretend you're an asshole. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1494.72s)]
*  Again, the big divide is Democrats pretend you're evil for not accepting their weird thing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1497.36s)]
*  If you go to a Civil War guy and you're like, that shit is weird to me. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1503.28s)]
*  They're not going to be like, well, you don't like history? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1506.48s)]
*  Do you not like the freedom of our country? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1508.24s)]
*  No. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  They're fucking weird. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1510.3400000000001s)]
*  If those people got loud, fuck them. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1511.28s)]
*  They'd be like, bro, I'm from the 1800s. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  You don't think I can identify? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it the 1800s? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1517.2s)]
*  Dude, they're so embarrassed to do those things. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1519.52s)]
*  They're so embarrassed. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1522.72s)]
*  I haven't met anybody. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1523.8400000000001s)]
*  There's not enough. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1524.8s)]
*  If they got really loud and really started to cause ripples in the Republican Party, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1525.44s)]
*  we'd be like, fuck Republicans. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1529.92s)]
*  Right now, there's I imagine a small faction of women that are saying they're going to [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1532.48s)]
*  protest the results of the election by not having sex with men anymore and shaving their heads. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1536.8s)]
*  The 4B movement? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1541.68s)]
*  Yeah, the 4B movement. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1543.36s)]
*  In Korea, apparently, I guess South Korea, I'm assuming, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1544.48s)]
*  women stopped having sex with men because the men were just so toxic and such assholes and whatever. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1547.28s)]
*  And then the birth rate dropped. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  Or stopped giving birth. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1553.68s)]
*  And then the birth rate is dropping and the government's panicking. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1556.24s)]
*  And they're like, nah, fuck you, fix the men. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1558.6399999999999s)]
*  Where it's not going to end, maybe. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1560.32s)]
*  And so now women in America are co-opted with this. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1562.0s)]
*  Y'all love dick too much. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1564.56s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1565.84s)]
*  There ain't no way she could follow through. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1566.96s)]
*  Two months from then, maybe. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1568.8799999999999s)]
*  But nah, you coming back. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1570.32s)]
*  You coming back. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1572.24s)]
*  But they got dildos. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1574.08s)]
*  They can get a dildo. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1575.6s)]
*  But they can't disappoint them. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1576.48s)]
*  If you really want a good dildo, the battery would go out after like a minute and 30 seconds. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1580.24s)]
*  This is so realistic. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  This dildo's insanely realistic. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1587.04s)]
*  So there's a perfect example. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1589.68s)]
*  I apologize to you after. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1590.72s)]
*  Not normal. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1592.64s)]
*  You're being weird and you're pretending you're not being weird. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1593.44s)]
*  And we need to at least have those conversations. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1597.52s)]
*  And I think that there's this great umbrella that a lot of these things fit under that are very [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1599.92s)]
*  frustrating for guys. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1604.8s)]
*  And not only guys, I imagine a lot of women are frustrated by too. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1606.48s)]
*  But it's a very just frustrating culture to live within. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1609.84s)]
*  And most people, because they live in corporate America or work in corporate America, they're like, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1612.48s)]
*  I'm not going to touch it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1616.0s)]
*  I'm not going to broach it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1616.88s)]
*  Because I don't want to get fired. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1617.76s)]
*  I don't want to cause an issue at work. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1618.8s)]
*  I don't even want to have an uncomfortable conversation. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1619.92s)]
*  And then they went into the booth and they did all their talking in that booth. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1622.08s)]
*  And I think for Democrats, they either need to acknowledge that or, and this is another good [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1627.68s)]
*  argument that I read, is they need to make a move towards what Bernie Sanders did in 2016. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1634.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1640.56s)]
*  There was an article I read and I thought that positioned this pretty well. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1642.24s)]
*  You know, could be bullshit, but I thought there's kind of interesting take, which was [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1645.28s)]
*  essentially Bernie Sanders spearheads this movement for the Democratic Party that is derivative of [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1648.72s)]
*  Democratic politics, but not controlled by the traditional leaders within the Democratic Party. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1656.96s)]
*  And it is a working class movement trying to help working class people who are absolutely [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1664.64s)]
*  struggling. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1668.88s)]
*  This is 2016. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1669.28s)]
*  And it gets incredibly popular. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1670.96s)]
*  It's raising money. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1673.2s)]
*  And insane clip. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1674.16s)]
*  It was democratic socialism, but it's really just focused on the working class, right? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1675.3600000000001s)]
*  There's no racial component at all. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1678.64s)]
*  The only identity politics that was wrapped around it was essentially wealth inequality. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1680.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1684.16s)]
*  And it's so popular that apparently the traditional Democrats who control the Democratic Party had to [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  find a way to thwart the popularity. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1694.24s)]
*  So what they did is, and I don't know if you remember articles coming up about this, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1696.64s)]
*  but essentially they started calling the Bernie Bros. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1700.0s)]
*  Sexist and racist. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1704.56s)]
*  There's a Bernie Bro problem. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1706.08s)]
*  Bernie supporters have an issue. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1708.4s)]
*  Not too dissimilar to what they've been calling the Bro Podcasts. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1710.88s)]
*  Sexist or racist. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1715.6s)]
*  It's kind of the same playbook. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1716.56s)]
*  It's like you see something very powerful that's helping somebody that is not you. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1717.76s)]
*  You have to make them radioactive so people don't go in that direction. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1721.68s)]
*  And all the same thing they said about Bernie supporters. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1725.04s)]
*  They've said about the podcasts that have allegedly helped Trump get elected. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1727.92s)]
*  And what happened is the traditional Democrat Party then had to pivot away from the working class. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1732.88s)]
*  And as you see by this election, the working class did not really support them at all. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1740.16s)]
*  And they even lost union support. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1743.76s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1746.0s)]
*  And they had to pivot towards identity politics. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1746.24s)]
*  And now they had to constantly appease the intersectionality folk. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1748.3200000000002s)]
*  And the problem with them is you're not just appeasing gays [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1752.88s)]
*  or just appeasing trans. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1757.12s)]
*  They are all very concerned with oppressed groups. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1758.9599999999998s)]
*  So something that oppresses the Asians, all of a sudden the gays are going to be like, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1762.08s)]
*  well, they're an oppressed group too. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  You need to look out for them as well. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1768.56s)]
*  And now there's this web of oppressed groups. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1770.56s)]
*  So now the Democratic Party is like, fuck, we can't piss off any of them. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  And now they're frozen. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1775.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1778.7199999999998s)]
*  They can be at odds. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1779.1999999999998s)]
*  Like you saw with the DEI stuff. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1780.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, hey, we're going to stop doing, like we'll get more affirmative action, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1781.36s)]
*  people of different ethnicities in school. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1785.2s)]
*  And it's like, well, this is disadvantaging Asians. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1787.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's like, oh, fuck. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1789.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1790.24s)]
*  Now the Democrats are frozen. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1790.48s)]
*  Now we're starting Asian hate. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1791.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1792.64s)]
*  So you try to appease everybody because you've become the party of identity politics. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1794.56s)]
*  And then you appease none of them. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1799.2s)]
*  And as you saw what happened, obviously, in Israel, Palestine right now, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1800.72s)]
*  a lot of those people were absolutely furious with the Democratic Party and decided to abstain. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1804.64s)]
*  They maybe didn't vote for Trump, but they were definitely not voting for this administration. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1808.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1811.3600000000001s)]
*  So that move, I think tanked, I think tanked the party. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1812.74s)]
*  Do you think that justifies the top ticket switch in a lot of swing states? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1818.5s)]
*  Like people voting Democrats out of line, but then voting Trump for president, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1822.58s)]
*  which a lot of people pointed out as potential voter fraud. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1825.86s)]
*  A lot of these swing states, you have people that are Democrat, Democrat, everything local, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1829.86s)]
*  Senate, House, everything Democrat, and then Trump for president. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1833.3s)]
*  And people are like, we've never seen that ever in history. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1836.1s)]
*  AOC asks, to her credit, she's been kind of reaching across the aisle ideologically asking [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1837.7s)]
*  what podcast do y'all listen to, that good whatever, you're a Trump guy. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1843.8600000000001s)]
*  Also, why would y'all do this? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1846.9s)]
*  And she got answers back. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1848.26s)]
*  Some people were like, look, I'm not happy with the presidency. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1849.7s)]
*  I'm not happy with the last four years ago. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1853.38s)]
*  I'm still a Democrat. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1854.82s)]
*  Some people just being like, I like Trump, but I do want some balance in the government. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1855.54s)]
*  I don't want it to be completely red. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1860.5s)]
*  So there were seemingly real answers and explanations on why people did that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1862.02s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1866.1000000000001s)]
*  Another interesting thing I saw is that Kamala made a lot of her election run about abortion. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1866.74s)]
*  And clearly, people want their abortions because they assume that, oh, if people [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1874.74s)]
*  go out to vote to keep abortion rights, they're also going to vote for Kamala. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1881.86s)]
*  But there were so many more votes for abortion rights, but then also for Trump. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1886.26s)]
*  So it's like, they bet on that and it failed. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1891.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1893.78s)]
*  People buy more groceries than abortions. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1894.26s)]
*  She couldn't really do anything for abortion. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1896.9s)]
*  If they had all three, they could codify it, I guess. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1900.74s)]
*  No, but they don't. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1902.8200000000002s)]
*  The thing that's crazy is that in, I think, 2022, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1903.8600000000001s)]
*  there was like seven states that had abortion rights on the ballot, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1909.78s)]
*  and all seven states' abortion rights won. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1912.8200000000002s)]
*  And so now they saw that, they're like, okay, let's run this time because [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1916.66s)]
*  people actually came out in the midterm elections, which rarely happens. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1920.42s)]
*  So they ran on that. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1923.3s)]
*  But to separate those two things, you have to combine Kamala with abortion rights. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1924.34s)]
*  But the fact that you can vote for one and not the other, that's what fucked her up. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1929.1399999999999s)]
*  Because now it's like people like, hey, this is the issue I care about. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1934.8999999999999s)]
*  But it is kind of- [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1937.7s)]
*  You actually made me care about this issue enough to come out, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1938.26s)]
*  but I'm only voting on that issue. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1941.3799999999999s)]
*  And then if you make your whole election or your campaign about this one issue, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1942.82s)]
*  but what about all the other thing I care about and you're not addressing those things? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1946.98s)]
*  It's like, she kind of fucked herself up. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1949.78s)]
*  I think the tricky thing about that is just the way that the system is set up [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1951.78s)]
*  is that Kamala couldn't come in and do an executive order or anything that would protect [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1955.3s)]
*  or give back abortion rights. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1959.46s)]
*  And that was an issue actually for me voting for her is, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1962.02s)]
*  because I sat there and I thought about it and I was like, well, yeah, I really, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1965.06s)]
*  I don't agree with the decision to send it back to the states. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1968.26s)]
*  And I want women to be able to maintain those rights. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1971.62s)]
*  Like even there's a lot, I don't know if we've discussed this on the pod, but like, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1973.7s)]
*  it's, and I've talked to a few women about this. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1977.7800000000002s)]
*  It's not even like they're going to use the abortions. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1981.0600000000002s)]
*  It's once you feel you have something and then it's taken away. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1984.26s)]
*  It's like if somebody goes, you can never go to a hockey game again. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1987.38s)]
*  And it's like, well, I wasn't going to go to a hockey game, but [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1990.5s)]
*  fucking I might want to go to a fucking hockey game. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1994.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like- [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1996.26s)]
*  And this is the most high stakes version of that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1996.8200000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1999.3000000000002s)]
*  Like if it was even something that small, I would be like, well, why can they go to a fucking high? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=1999.7800000000002s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2006.5800000000002s)]
*  You just start to feel, it feels like an attack on your freedom. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2008.1000000000001s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy for guys who it doesn't affect us in any way, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2013.3s)]
*  but I get the idea of women are like, I could do this thing. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2018.1000000000001s)]
*  And now you're telling me I can't do this thing. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2020.5800000000002s)]
*  The gun thing you talked about last week, like you can't have a rocket launcher anymore. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2022.5800000000002s)]
*  It's like, well, I didn't have one. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2025.78s)]
*  But now I fucking won one. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2026.98s)]
*  Why do you get to decide if I can have a rocket launcher? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2028.9s)]
*  But then when I found out, because I asked, I was like, okay, let's say she gets elected. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2032.5800000000002s)]
*  What would she do? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2035.46s)]
*  And then it's like, well, she can't do anything. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2036.5s)]
*  Maybe she could put in Supreme Court justices if she had the opportunity. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2038.98s)]
*  And then maybe they could look at, I guess, Roe v. Wade again. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2043.22s)]
*  And then maybe if they were able to flip the Senate in the House, they could codify it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2046.66s)]
*  Codify it? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2053.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2053.7s)]
*  So it's like, there's all these maybes, but there wasn't anything tangible that she could do. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2054.82s)]
*  So I'm like, am I about to not care about all these other issues that I think that she's abysmal on [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2058.42s)]
*  for this one issue that she truly cannot do anything about? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2063.3s)]
*  And it didn't seem like it made sense for me. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2066.6600000000003s)]
*  People were so surprised that so many women voted for Trump because they tried to make it like, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2068.6600000000003s)]
*  oh, a vote for Trump is a vote against women's reproductive rights. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2073.3s)]
*  But if Trump did a great job of saying, he appeased both groups, he said, hey, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2078.42s)]
*  I'm the guy responsible for getting Roe v. Wade overturned. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2084.98s)]
*  So that appeased all the people who are against abortion. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2088.1800000000003s)]
*  But then he also said, I am not going to make any federal ban on abortion. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2090.42s)]
*  So now at least it gives hope to the people who care about abortion. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2094.98s)]
*  It's like, okay, we can leave it up to the state. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2098.58s)]
*  He also said on our pod that- [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2099.78s)]
*  He did that masterfully. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2101.2200000000003s)]
*  No, he handled that really well. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2102.1800000000003s)]
*  Also said on our pod, if some states overreach, like Arizona, I assume Texas as well, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2103.86s)]
*  he would tell them, I'm not going to support this. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2107.94s)]
*  Yeah, you guys need to roll it back a little bit. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2110.5s)]
*  Like a lot of the abortion bans are not that crazy. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2113.7000000000003s)]
*  Texas is insane. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2116.58s)]
*  A couple others, Alabama, probably Arizona, probably. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2118.1s)]
*  And if you are listening and you're like, oh, if Trump will get those to kind of like be more [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2120.3399999999997s)]
*  lenient, then maybe that's not the worst thing in the world. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2124.74s)]
*  So yeah, he just, he handled it masterfully. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2127.22s)]
*  And like you said, I don't think Kamala did a good job. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2129.46s)]
*  She never got to connect. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2132.02s)]
*  That was a big, I don't even know if this is wrestling or not, but like we never got to [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2133.38s)]
*  know her as a person. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2136.66s)]
*  And I think that's what you talked about last week, which is just a massive- [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2138.1s)]
*  Yeah, she sucked. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2141.22s)]
*  And now what I've seen some people on the Democrat side do is like they're trying to blame Biden for [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2141.94s)]
*  this. Like there's this- [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2147.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, big blame Biden movement. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2148.58s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2150.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of blame. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2151.06s)]
*  He didn't help. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2151.62s)]
*  No, no, no. I agree with you. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2152.5s)]
*  He didn't help. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2154.1s)]
*  And like there are some reports that are saying like if he had ran, there would have been an [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2154.8199999999997s)]
*  even greater landslide victory for Trump, which I do believe because I think that people [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2159.14s)]
*  viewed him as a danger to the United States of America, him in charge. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2163.46s)]
*  So I do understand that. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2167.14s)]
*  And I do believe that he didn't help. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2168.42s)]
*  But what I would say is that the biggest issue for the Democrats, and I think you could solve [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2169.8599999999997s)]
*  so much is if they allow the democratic process to actually work, you will see the party flourish. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2175.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2185.62s)]
*  So a perfect example is this. This almost unknown, one term Senator out of Chicago [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2186.02s)]
*  gives a speech at the DNC and fucking rocks the house. This guy is originally from Hawaii. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2195.54s)]
*  His middle name is one of the synonymous, one of the most terrifying figures in American history. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2204.26s)]
*  Like everything about him on paper shouldn't work, but he was so magnetic that you could not deny him. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2209.62s)]
*  The people decided after Barack, it hasn't been the people deciding. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2220.9s)]
*  Hillary was supposed to run. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2225.7s)]
*  Hillary was supposed to run. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2226.98s)]
*  They want Hillary run, but they see what's happening right this. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2227.94s)]
*  And then the party made the smart decision, which was like, hey, the people have decided they want this. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2230.82s)]
*  The Democratic Party has these things called superdelegates. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2235.46s)]
*  We've spoken about this a lot. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2237.86s)]
*  So in the primary process, there can be like an ex governor or something like that. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2238.9s)]
*  And his one vote is worth 10,000 votes. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2242.34s)]
*  So in the event that somebody's losing a primary, you can, or the caucuses is that essentially, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2245.06s)]
*  but you can, that one governor's vote can offset what the people want. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2251.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2256.42s)]
*  And they use that to control the candidate. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2257.38s)]
*  And the problem with that is if you're controlling the candidate, you're stripping the people of what they want. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2259.94s)]
*  And by stripping the people what they want, you actually hurt yourself. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2266.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2269.46s)]
*  Because you don't get a candidate that's going to reflect the desires of the people. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2269.62s)]
*  You put 10 people on that stage, two or three of them are going to start hitting on issues that matter to people. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2273.14s)]
*  They're going to start going viral. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2279.3s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of interest, a lot of donations. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2280.58s)]
*  And then one of them is going to win. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2283.46s)]
*  And he might be a guy who hosted the apprentice. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2285.38s)]
*  That's what happens on the Republican side. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2288.1s)]
*  Democratic primary is shockingly not democratic. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2290.1s)]
*  It's not democratic. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2292.42s)]
*  And it goes back to their pretentiousness. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2293.86s)]
*  It's this, hey, we know what you guys need. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2296.18s)]
*  We know what's right. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2299.06s)]
*  You guys are fucking dumb. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2300.9s)]
*  Let's us handle this and we'll figure it all out. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2303.06s)]
*  Or we know what we want. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2305.54s)]
*  And you guys are so dumb, you'll believe us. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2307.14s)]
*  While we, as Nancy Pelosi, I'm going to make hundreds of millions on the stock market or whatever. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2309.38s)]
*  And you retards are just going to believe me because I'm going to throw you a little bone [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2314.5s)]
*  about your identity politics or whatever. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2317.54s)]
*  You know what I just thought of as you were talking? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2319.38s)]
*  The last time the Democrats had a primary that we felt was truly democratic [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2320.98s)]
*  and lost the presidential election was probably 1988. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2326.1s)]
*  Clinton won in 92, repeated in 96. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2330.18s)]
*  2000 Al Gore ran as VP. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2332.66s)]
*  Maybe he won the primary. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2334.9s)]
*  But it was 2000, one time in 30 years. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2336.82s)]
*  You usually let the VP, but maybe he did win the primary. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2338.98s)]
*  Either way, if so, that's 24 years. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2342.18s)]
*  That's the only time. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2344.34s)]
*  Hillary in 2016, they lost because we felt the primary was rigged. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2345.3s)]
*  And it seems like it was. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2348.34s)]
*  2024, there was no primary. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2349.7000000000003s)]
*  None of us want a comma, it seems. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2351.38s)]
*  And you guys can tell me she would have won a primary. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2353.0600000000004s)]
*  That means your party is an even bigger joke. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2355.46s)]
*  If she won the primary and y'all got your asses beaten this bad in the general, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2358.34s)]
*  then y'all got to look out. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2361.7000000000003s)]
*  Also to your point, yeah, I would agree that Republicans don't do that as much [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2363.3s)]
*  because after January 6, Trump was toxic. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2367.46s)]
*  People, like the party was trying to move away from him. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2371.86s)]
*  Fox News, everybody, they were speaking out bad about him. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2375.14s)]
*  But the people were like, no, we still fuck with this guy. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2378.66s)]
*  And they had to pivot and be like, all right, they're the side guy again. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2381.46s)]
*  Yeah, because they don't have the super delegate system. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2384.7400000000002s)]
*  So they can't offset it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2387.94s)]
*  They can use media to offset it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2389.06s)]
*  They can use political pressure. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2390.5s)]
*  But they can't stop the people from having a say with their vote. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2393.14s)]
*  And what you end up getting are the people that are communicating the desires of the... [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2396.58s)]
*  Sorry, the candidates that are communicating the desires of the people. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2401.86s)]
*  So it's almost like Democrats, you don't need to fix that much. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2405.38s)]
*  Just let the system work. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2408.9s)]
*  Stop rigging the system and you will get candidates that are speaking to what the people actually desire. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2411.86s)]
*  What the people actually desire might not be what you believe your party is. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2418.1800000000003s)]
*  But it's not up to you to decide what your party is. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2422.82s)]
*  The people decide. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2426.42s)]
*  But them donors, though. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2428.26s)]
*  Yeah, I listen to them donors. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2430.82s)]
*  That was the other issue. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2432.66s)]
*  Is that Bernie was a move away from the billionaire class and the political donors that are controlling [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2433.7s)]
*  the Democratic Party, and they couldn't let that power go to some guy that wasn't bought. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2442.5s)]
*  So they had to make him radioactive. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2449.7s)]
*  And I don't see that ever changing. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2452.26s)]
*  Well, that's another thing. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2454.74s)]
*  It's like... [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2455.78s)]
*  I can see it changing eventually. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2456.9s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2458.58s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2459.06s)]
*  No, I just... [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2459.7s)]
*  You had a point about this yesterday. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2459.94s)]
*  Ultimately, the wealth gap just gets so big that there's a quasi revolution, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2461.8599999999997s)]
*  whether it's political or physical, and then it will reset. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2465.62s)]
*  And give an example of what that looks like. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2469.8599999999997s)]
*  I understand what you're saying. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2472.18s)]
*  I think it makes sense. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2472.98s)]
*  I think the European model where it is more socialist, in the sense that you have universal [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2473.7s)]
*  health care and that there's going to be more government-funded opportunities, resources, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2479.2999999999997s)]
*  and access to education and health care and shit all through Europe, in America the way it is there. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2486.82s)]
*  How... [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2492.02s)]
*  But we're going to get taxed more. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2492.42s)]
*  How big do you think the wealth gap has to get before that happens? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2493.46s)]
*  Because it's pretty large. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2496.6600000000003s)]
*  It's not... [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2499.06s)]
*  It's actually, if I can interject, it's not the distance between the richest people and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2499.6200000000003s)]
*  the poorest people. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2506.1000000000004s)]
*  It's the distance between the poorest people and deaf. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2507.06s)]
*  And the more poor people are closer to deaf, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2511.6200000000003s)]
*  the more we're on the brink of revolution. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2516.02s)]
*  This is the French Revolution. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2518.74s)]
*  And the more these people are detached from what's going on, which is the Marie Antoinette quote, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2520.66s)]
*  they don't have bread. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2525.78s)]
*  We'll give them cake. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2526.58s)]
*  You're so... [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2528.34s)]
*  Well, yeah, I guess don't have bread means we don't have any food. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2530.5s)]
*  Not like, oh, the cakes are there. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2533.54s)]
*  Well, they just let them eat that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2534.98s)]
*  So yeah, I think once you have enough people that are essentially below the poverty line, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2536.58s)]
*  they're on the starvation line, the only option they have is rebellion. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2542.42s)]
*  And then the people at the top start to go, okay, we can either fight our own people and [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2546.9s)]
*  murder our own people to keep them broke, or we can restructure a system where we're still pretty [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2553.3s)]
*  wealthy, but we're not at the risk of rebellion and murder and them stealing our children and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2558.9s)]
*  destroying our livelihood. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2565.0600000000004s)]
*  Because rich people want to live comfortably. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2566.6600000000003s)]
*  Rich people don't want to live like a billionaire in Mexico where you're worried about your kid [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2569.38s)]
*  getting kidnapped every single day. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2572.9s)]
*  Rich people want to live like they got their place in Nantucket and they go there and it's safe, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2574.34s)]
*  and then they fly to Los Angeles. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2578.8199999999997s)]
*  Once poor people get to a point where they're going to kidnap your kids, society gets [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2582.2599999999998s)]
*  not comfortable for the rich. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2587.38s)]
*  So they start going, all right, let's give back a little bit. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2588.5s)]
*  Is there a less insane way that this happens? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2590.74s)]
*  Is there a less terrifying... [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2593.7799999999997s)]
*  There must be. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2595.62s)]
*  Because what happened when the 1% all those rallies and Occupy Wall Street, how'd they calm [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2596.34s)]
*  that voter pressure? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2603.7000000000003s)]
*  You just do it politically. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2605.38s)]
*  And that's also where Dave Smith said a lot of identity politics stuff started is like, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2605.94s)]
*  let's distract them from the wealth inequality, all the money we're taking. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2609.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you remember he said that, but let's make all this other identity politics [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2614.02s)]
*  shit pop off. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2617.2200000000003s)]
*  So we tried, and then they were like, chill. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2618.1800000000003s)]
*  The real problem is DEI. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2622.6600000000003s)]
*  The real problem is not enough diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2624.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2627.54s)]
*  So just make a new enemy. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2627.8599999999997s)]
*  You create something to satisfy people's reason for why they're not given the opportunity [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2630.3399999999997s)]
*  that these other people are. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2635.94s)]
*  When the reality is it's... [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2637.7799999999997s)]
*  Migrants taking all the resources. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2639.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2640.98s)]
*  Anything but rich people are keeping all the money and opportunity for the rich people. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2641.94s)]
*  Got it. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2646.4199999999996s)]
*  Like, you really want to fix that DEI or whatever in colleges. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2647.14s)]
*  Because if you went to a university, your kids can't go there. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2652.58s)]
*  You will see Harvard, Yale, Princeton, immediately switched. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2660.98s)]
*  Something get a little darker. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2667.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2668.42s)]
*  They'll immediately be more diverse. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2670.58s)]
*  Because the amount of legacy kids that end up going to these schools, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2674.26s)]
*  and keep in mind with more graduates, there's even more. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2677.62s)]
*  If you donate to a school, your kid can't go there. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2680.42s)]
*  You're donating out of the goodness of your heart. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2682.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2684.42s)]
*  Them donations going evaporate. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2684.74s)]
*  This is something that doesn't benefit the school or the rich people, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2688.34s)]
*  but they're not going to do that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2690.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2691.94s)]
*  Oh no, let's just pander and have 10 black kids every year, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2692.74s)]
*  and then make them feel like charity while they're here. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2696.82s)]
*  So that's the solution. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2699.62s)]
*  Now again, I would like to think if they just got rid of super-dellies. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2702.02s)]
*  And now they took that away. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2704.58s)]
*  Now we have no black kids. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2706.74s)]
*  I don't believe that the DEI thing in certain industries is helpful though. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2707.86s)]
*  I think that there's probably a better way to address that, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2715.94s)]
*  but I don't know if addressing at the top of the line is what's going to make the change. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2719.94s)]
*  I mean, but it's something. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2724.9s)]
*  It's better than nothing. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2726.26s)]
*  I think there are better ways to fix it, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2728.02s)]
*  but by just doing away with it altogether, you already just named [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2729.7000000000003s)]
*  ways that other groups of people have leg ups. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2733.78s)]
*  They're a step ahead. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2737.06s)]
*  I know medical school, when I was growing up, we're so old, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2738.7400000000002s)]
*  now this is 20 years ago almost, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2742.34s)]
*  but when I was like in pre-med or whatever and I knew people that are applying, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2743.78s)]
*  it was so, the requirements for black slash Latino people to get into medical school was [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2747.38s)]
*  so much lower. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2753.86s)]
*  And I'm not even mad at the people, but I do, a part of my brain is like, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2755.06s)]
*  I guess I understand they're going to be able to connect with their patients better, et cetera. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2759.06s)]
*  At the same time, if you're not giving them as good a quality of care, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2763.3s)]
*  because you don't know as much, is that a terrifying thing? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2766.34s)]
*  I'm not one way or the other, but that does make a lot, logically I'm like, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2770.6600000000003s)]
*  that seems a little crazy. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2774.5s)]
*  Like I get the logic, but it's also, I don't think [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2775.54s)]
*  all people from black and brown communities are trying to get into Ivy League schools. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2781.38s)]
*  Like we are not applying at the rate that other people are. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2785.3s)]
*  So it's like, you're not always getting our best candidates. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2788.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2791.1400000000003s)]
*  Sometimes to try to incentivize more people from black and brown communities to go there. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2792.5s)]
*  Well, here's what I'm saying. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2797.86s)]
*  You drop maybe the scores, I wouldn't say they're drastically low. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2798.58s)]
*  My school is a small school, it's like a private dork school. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2802.02s)]
*  300 kids, 150 are pre-med, every race. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2805.38s)]
*  You see the kids who make it through. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2808.82s)]
*  I know a person who did worse on their MCATs than me. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2810.26s)]
*  Granted, I guess they played a sport, but worse on their MCATs than me, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2813.54s)]
*  GPA was fine, got into the best medical school in Texas. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2816.82s)]
*  I didn't, the Caribbean was like, maybe we'll take you. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2820.1800000000003s)]
*  I get that, but you're also talking about getting into the school and sometimes you [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2824.98s)]
*  had the resources to have MCATs, prep classes and tutors and all that shit. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2832.6600000000003s)]
*  A lot of times those people don't, but lasting in the school is what counts. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2836.82s)]
*  So it's like, can that black or brown student make it through med school? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2840.5s)]
*  Can they pass all their requirements? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2844.82s)]
*  Lasting is easier. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2846.5800000000004s)]
*  They're just. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2847.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, lasting is easy. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2847.7000000000003s)]
*  Lasting is easier. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2848.5800000000004s)]
*  If you can get through the program, that means you're just as capable. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2849.78s)]
*  If you're at my school, the private school, you're not some poor kid. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2852.7400000000002s)]
*  We had people, I guess, sure, but these, I know these people. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2856.42s)]
*  They're not poor people. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2859.3s)]
*  They're not struggling to eat. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2860.5s)]
*  This wasn't like a thing. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2862.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying they were rich, but again, I'm telling you, having experienced it, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2863.38s)]
*  I understand your theory and in theory it is good, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2867.06s)]
*  but then you also start thinking this is medical care. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2869.94s)]
*  And to your point, to be fair to you, how you do an undergraduate doesn't mean [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2872.7400000000002s)]
*  you're going to do well in med school or not. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2876.82s)]
*  It's just how well you do in fucking physics or whatever. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2878.74s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2881.54s)]
*  You're saying that. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2882.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm saying that's to your point. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2883.54s)]
*  But still, that idea is a little bit crazy. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2884.58s)]
*  This is medicine. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2889.2999999999997s)]
*  This is people's lives on the line. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2890.02s)]
*  But I'm saying, if they're not capable of graduating, then they're not capable. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2892.18s)]
*  I understand Al's point too, which is like, okay, let's say their SAT scores are lower, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2898.18s)]
*  but if they're able to graduate at the same level, then they were able to [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2902.1s)]
*  acquire enough information and education through that process to do the job, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2905.62s)]
*  which I agree with you and I totally make sense. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2909.22s)]
*  And I think that's the idea behind, in a lot of ways, DEI, is that some of these people might [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2911.14s)]
*  not have the high SAT scores because they can't afford all these things that give you a huge [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2915.94s)]
*  advantage, which is taking like the Kaplan SAT prep classes, et cetera. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2919.8599999999997s)]
*  I think everybody's on the same page with that. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2923.22s)]
*  And I think that poor white people also look at that and they go, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2925.06s)]
*  yeah, that's unfair that those rich fucking white people get to take all those classes. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2929.06s)]
*  I think they feel a little disenfranchised that just because they share the same skin color, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2933.22s)]
*  they are not afforded those opportunities that the black people are. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2938.58s)]
*  And that there are wealthy, like, nepo baby black people that are taking advantage of these DEI [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2943.14s)]
*  things that are really not made for them. They're made for more disenfranchised people. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2952.74s)]
*  And I think that's why the program that uplifts people from poverty into positions of prosperity [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2958.5s)]
*  just has to assess these struggles. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2968.82s)]
*  So the poor disenfranchised white, the poor disenfranchised black, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2972.34s)]
*  the poor disenfranchised Latino or Asian, whatever it is, they all have to feel like [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2975.86s)]
*  they're being taken care of and protected in the system that's really not built for them. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2980.58s)]
*  And I think right now the sentiment, the feeling, the perception, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2986.02s)]
*  we're talking so much about perception, is just for people of color. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2990.34s)]
*  And it might not actually be going to the people of color that really need the help, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=2994.58s)]
*  but in fact, the people of color that don't need the help. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3001.7s)]
*  Like Steph Curry's kids don't need a DEI program to get into somewhere, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3007.38s)]
*  but they would benefit from it simply because of the color of their skin. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3012.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3016.58s)]
*  And I would agree with you and I'm like, with any program, people are going to find, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3017.06s)]
*  take advantage and find a lookalike. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3021.7000000000003s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3022.98s)]
*  All groups. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3023.46s)]
*  So it's one of those things where it's like, I don't think we wipe it off and go, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3024.7400000000002s)]
*  we don't do anything. I think we go, well, what else can we do to fix this fucking problem? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3027.46s)]
*  If you make a class issue that's not racist. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3032.1s)]
*  Yes, if part of diversity was socioeconomic, if it was socioeconomic over racial, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3034.1s)]
*  if it's a tiebreaker, sure. Poor white kid, poor black kid, give it to the poor black kid, I guess. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3038.34s)]
*  But like a poor white kid not getting to take advantage does seem like. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3042.7400000000002s)]
*  And then it's more fun. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3046.1800000000003s)]
*  It's more fun when you're just helping all poor people, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3048.1800000000003s)]
*  because then you really get to decide and like find out who's the smartest race. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3050.58s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3054.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3055.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Because like if black people thrive, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3055.6200000000003s)]
*  are you sure you want to do this? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3058.6600000000003s)]
*  This is good because if black people thrive, right? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3059.78s)]
*  Like if it's just for poor people and black people thrive, they get to go, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3062.42s)]
*  see, we're smarter than you motherfuckers. You just got more money. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3065.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3067.86s)]
*  So now you get to put your money where your mouth is. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3068.9s)]
*  But some poor Asians. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3070.9s)]
*  Guys, guys, guys, poor Asians end up winning, then we all got to get them out of the country. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3071.7000000000003s)]
*  We have to. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3075.94s)]
*  I was going to say, you're all fighting for seconds. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3076.6600000000003s)]
*  Let's be honest about this. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3078.6600000000003s)]
*  Let's be honest about this. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3080.34s)]
*  Not you, the other Asians. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3081.7000000000003s)]
*  You never see a poor Asian though. I was going to say you saw a homeless Asian guy. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3084.34s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3086.82s)]
*  I see a poor Asian. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3087.38s)]
*  Collecting cans outside right now. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3087.86s)]

*  In a while. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3099.46s)]
*  Is it inflation? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3099.94s)]
*  No, they're in Williamsburg. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3101.3s)]
*  No, Latinos got it. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3102.34s)]

*  I still don't know what you're describing. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3156.18s)]
*  He's just describing literally. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3157.8599999999997s)]
*  He's like, oh, I'm going to make it easier so they don't have to dig into a bag. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3159.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to leave the can on top of something. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3162.74s)]
*  Public service. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3164.5s)]
*  We got a trash chute so it stays in the building so no Chinese ladies can get it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3165.62s)]
*  But they go through the bags once they put the bags on the street. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3170.58s)]
*  No. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3173.54s)]
*  They never put it on the street. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3173.7799999999997s)]
*  They stay in the chute. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3174.8199999999997s)]

*  Really? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3176.1s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3176.3399999999997s)]
*  And then it's in a dumpster and it fucking goes off. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3177.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm saying you just leave it right on the side. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3179.46s)]
*  Build it up. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3180.98s)]
*  It's like Salvation Army. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3181.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3182.9s)]
*  Salvation Red Army. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3183.94s)]

*  They get so excited. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3187.7000000000003s)]
*  If you saw the look on their faces, bro, chasing their tails going in circles. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3188.5s)]

*  They're off of the can game, huh? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3195.78s)]
*  Not my neighborhood. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3198.82s)]
*  It's great. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3199.62s)]
*  Is it still five cents for a can? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3200.9s)]
*  I don't know the actual return, but there's a return spot. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3203.54s)]

*  It's not even went up. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3214.18s)]
*  It's ten cents now. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3214.98s)]
*  It should be ten cents. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3215.62s)]
*  I thought it was ten. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3216.66s)]
*  Hopefully, I'm just a bad boy. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3217.2999999999997s)]
*  How much is it? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3218.8199999999997s)]
*  How much is it? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3219.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3220.5s)]
*  It's on this. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3220.98s)]
*  Five cents. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3223.14s)]
*  Five cents still? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3224.1s)]
*  Thank you, dumb motherfuckers. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3224.98s)]
*  Don't know anything about recycling. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3226.34s)]
*  It's like an inflation, bro. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3228.02s)]
*  You never collected cans in your life, huh? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3230.58s)]
*  I have. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3232.42s)]
*  You never collected a can? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3232.8199999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3234.58s)]
*  Right here. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3234.9s)]
*  Yeah, I did in Texas. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3235.62s)]
*  We had like three dollars. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3236.58s)]
*  I collected cans religiously. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3238.1s)]
*  Twice a year? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3240.66s)]
*  Every summer at my beach house when I was two. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3241.54s)]
*  But I had to set it up like that. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3248.34s)]
*  Every summer at my beach house, I would go around. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3250.1s)]
*  I would collect all the cans. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3252.1s)]
*  And this was a thing that the kids did. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3253.7s)]
*  We didn't have activities. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3255.22s)]
*  And we would collect all the cans. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3256.66s)]
*  We'd give them back to the supermarket. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3258.1s)]
*  We'd get five cents a can. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3259.46s)]
*  And I was loaded. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3260.5s)]
*  I'd be buying ice creams with that shit. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3261.3s)]
*  I'm digging inside garbage. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3263.06s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3265.06s)]
*  I remember being at that age when you're young [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3265.38s)]
*  and you don't know that you're poor yet. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3267.7s)]
*  And I would go with my dad. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3269.06s)]
*  To collect other people's cans? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3270.9s)]
*  We would just take our recycling [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3272.02s)]
*  but then go to the fucking supermarket. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3273.46s)]
*  That's not poor. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3276.1800000000003s)]
*  Nobody did that shit. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3278.1s)]
*  We didn't have five cents deposits in Texas. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3279.7000000000003s)]
*  And I didn't realize that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3282.02s)]
*  So I saw that five cents shit [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3282.98s)]
*  and I stored all these cans and took it to Texas. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3284.1800000000003s)]
*  And they were like, all right, man, here's like a quarter. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3285.94s)]
*  But they do need to up that because in 1999, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3290.1s)]
*  five cents was way different than now. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3292.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3294.1s)]
*  Like by a lot. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3294.7400000000002s)]
*  What's five cents now? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3295.54s)]
*  Let me find out. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3296.5s)]
*  Huh. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3297.94s)]
*  I mean, pennies are a negative production, right? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3298.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3303.46s)]
*  It's nine cents. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3305.06s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3307.14s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3308.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, it's like less. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3310.1s)]
*  How does this even make sense? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3311.7799999999997s)]
*  Of course it's less, Mark. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3313.14s)]
*  No, but it says it's more. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3314.66s)]
*  The same item would cost nine cents today. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3316.02s)]
*  Yo, take the computer [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3319.3799999999997s)]
*  and I want you to smash it over the top of this thing. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3321.22s)]
*  I was trying to find out what five cents is today. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3323.46s)]
*  Five cents is cute. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3325.62s)]

*  Admission. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3332.74s)]
*  How much is five cents? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3333.22s)]
*  Five cents is five cents today. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3334.1s)]
*  Ask him what his degree is in. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3336.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what is your degree in? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3338.5s)]
*  Economics. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3339.54s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3341.06s)]
*  But not street economics. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3341.8599999999997s)]
*  No, not putting cans, bro. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3342.98s)]

*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3346.18s)]
*  to talk about this bad boy right here. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3347.94s)]
*  This is a flavored air device. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3349.46s)]
*  You guys know that flavored air is quickly becoming [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3351.22s)]
*  the leading alternative to vaping and smoking. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3353.54s)]
*  We're talking about a whole new movement towards better [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3355.62s)]
*  habits and lifestyles led by these guys. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3357.7799999999997s)]
*  Fume. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3360.66s)]
*  Fume is the leader in flavored air devices, like I said, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3361.06s)]
*  which is a great way to help you quit smoking. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3363.14s)]
*  All right, it's not like vaping. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3365.06s)]
*  If vapor was compared to like a sticky soda, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3366.74s)]
*  this is an herbal tea. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3369.62s)]
*  It has a bunch of delicious flavors to choose from. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3370.98s)]
*  There's crisp mint, orange vanilla, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3372.9s)]
*  and the new peach blush. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3374.74s)]
*  I fucked with the peach blush. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3375.7799999999997s)]
*  You should try that one. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3376.74s)]
*  With flavored air, guys, you can satisfy your oral fixation [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3377.62s)]
*  through a passive diffusion system that utilizes [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3380.02s)]
*  no electronics or combustion. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3382.34s)]
*  Also, you're going to have a little click. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3384.02s)]
*  I love that. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3386.1800000000003s)]

*  Raise a billion, 20 million in debt. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3482.34s)]

*  538 million on staff. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3490.02s)]
*  You can't die with it, baby. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3491.94s)]
*  We. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3494.26s)]

*  That's what I was doing. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3505.7000000000003s)]
*  It was just like you call your friends. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3506.5800000000004s)]

*  So let me just start spending it. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3510.82s)]
*  Between Black Lives Matter and Kamala, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3512.9s)]
*  we really need to have a conversation about Black people's money. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3514.5800000000004s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3517.2200000000003s)]
*  Don't group those two. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3518.9s)]
*  I mean, I think you bring up a very good point. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3521.38s)]
*  Yeah, between Black Lives Matter, NBA and NFL players. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3522.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3527.7s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3528.7400000000002s)]
*  It's true. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3529.38s)]
*  Podcasts. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3530.42s)]
*  Digital owners. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3530.9s)]
*  Tesla truck owners. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3531.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3533.14s)]
*  How about a fleet of Tesla trucks after one year in the red? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3534.1s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3541.86s)]
*  But who did they appoint? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3542.7400000000002s)]
*  Apparently, he appointed all the Project 2025. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3543.54s)]
*  Oh, I heard a good one. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3545.7s)]
*  Apparently, if Trump hasn't. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3548.02s)]
*  Bring that back up. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3549.38s)]
*  Yeah, we got to talk about that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3550.42s)]
*  Because you need to explain what Project 2025 is. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3551.54s)]
*  But apparently, if Trump hasn't posted that somebody is taking on a position, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3555.3s)]
*  it's not real and it's marketing. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3563.22s)]
*  So what's happening behind the scenes, allegedly, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3565.54s)]
*  is there are all these people that are up for the position, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3567.7799999999997s)]
*  but they haven't been officially offered it. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3571.14s)]
*  And what they're doing is leaking things to the press so that the press report it, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3573.38s)]
*  so that there is political and social pressure on the administration to appoint Trump. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3578.18s)]
*  Trump is the wrong guy to do that to, I think. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3583.2999999999997s)]
*  Or it's leaked by other people so that the press trashes the decision. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3584.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's smart. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3591.46s)]
*  So that the competitor can go, you don't want him. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3592.58s)]
*  I mean, look at how upset people are about this appointee. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3595.22s)]
*  Or this might be the one I'm thinking. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3598.8199999999997s)]
*  Or the administration leaks people, sees how the- [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3601.7s)]
*  The perception is. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3605.7s)]
*  Perception is, and then reacts accordingly. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3606.9s)]
*  So Marco Rubio's leaked Secretary of State decision for Donald Trump gets fucking trashed. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3609.54s)]
*  Dave Smith is like, this is the worst pick. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3615.14s)]
*  You might as well elect a Cheney, blah, blah, blah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3616.82s)]
*  Dave, I obviously trust. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3619.3s)]
*  But then if you're a Trump administration guy, you go, hey, let's just, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3620.26s)]
*  we're thinking about Marco Rubio. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3623.3s)]
*  Let's just leak that, see how people respond. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3624.34s)]
*  And when they trash him, be like, all right, maybe we'll have Marco Rubio. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3626.42s)]
*  I think that was real. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3629.54s)]
*  It wasn't real like a neo-con or whatever the fuck is. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3630.5s)]
*  And that's the biggest issue for anybody who voted for him specifically because [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3632.42s)]
*  you don't want foreign wars is you don't want any of these neo-cons, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3637.86s)]
*  these war hawks, Democrat or Republican in the administration. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3642.02s)]
*  So a lot of people saw that and they were heartbroken. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3645.86s)]
*  We're like, oh, I thought we're draining the swamp. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3647.54s)]
*  I thought we're not getting into these pointless foreign wars. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3648.98s)]
*  And then you're going to put a guy who's admittedly about that action. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3650.9s)]
*  Very concerning. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3656.42s)]
*  And I think a lot of people very upset. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3657.3s)]
*  Now, he hasn't been mentioned by Trump yet, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3659.06s)]
*  but I think that one might be real. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3661.46s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security is concerning. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3663.62s)]
*  Very. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3666.34s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3666.82s)]
*  And you should be upset about it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3667.46s)]
*  If you voted for that specific reason or those are one of the reasons why you voted for him, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3669.06s)]
*  you should be very upset about that. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3673.62s)]
*  Kristi Noem was this like, she was very attractive, I think was a governor of North Dakota, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3677.06s)]
*  but they picked her as Department of Homeland Security. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3682.9s)]
*  Potentially, this is like another one floated. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3685.7s)]
*  That might not be real, but like beautiful woman, but [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3687.7s)]
*  the fuck does someone from North Dakota know about Homeland Security? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3691.46s)]
*  We're not going to attack by a moose here. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3694.58s)]
*  We need an actual person who knows how to thwart terror attacks. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3696.18s)]
*  I don't think there's a lot of action happening in North Dakota. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3699.94s)]
*  Am I wrong for? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3704.66s)]
*  I don't know any of her history, so just because she's from there, she could have a bunch of. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3706.42s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3711.06s)]
*  What if she went to an Ivy League school? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3712.18s)]
*  No, you got to be on the water. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3714.18s)]
*  You got to be on a water state. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3715.46s)]
*  If you're not on a water state, there's nothing we can do about it. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3717.86s)]
*  Marco Rubio can do that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3719.86s)]
*  Say again? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=3721.14s)]

*  You could pack more coke in there. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4007.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm telling you, America runs on confidence and cocaine is confidence and Americans need cocaine. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4010.42s)]
*  I'm worried, to be completely honest with you, that without cocaine, the American empire is over. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4016.98s)]
*  I mean that a thousand percent. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4024.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm looking straight in your face right now. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4025.46s)]
*  Is this like when you said that we didn't drink water, we just drank coffee and alcohol for [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4027.3s)]
*  400 years or whatever? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4031.1400000000003s)]
*  I did believe that. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4032.7400000000002s)]
*  And I do believe that's why we were so productive. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4034.42s)]
*  Because we had caffeine and we had alcohol in the system and we thought of some crazy shit. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4037.22s)]
*  You look at the cathedral, you're like, what if the windows were painted colors too? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4043.14s)]
*  That is a caffeine and alcohol combination. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4048.34s)]
*  Who invented fucking cocaine? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4051.46s)]
*  The Mayans, the Aztecs. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4052.74s)]
*  What did they do? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4054.1s)]
*  The cities. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4054.98s)]
*  The first pyramids. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4055.62s)]
*  What? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4056.66s)]
*  I was going to talk about pyramids but also that. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4057.16s)]
*  Also that. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4058.74s)]
*  Sometimes you sacrifice a kid so a cactus grows. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4059.46s)]
*  Right? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4062.98s)]
*  That's also a cocaine idea right there. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4063.22s)]
*  Yeah, they're good with the bad. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4065.62s)]
*  They're good with the bad. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4066.74s)]
*  But America runs on cocaine so we need somebody to make it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4068.02s)]
*  So I think we just gotta- [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4071.7s)]
*  That's Duncan's new slogan. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4072.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4073.7s)]
*  America runs on cocaine. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4075.06s)]
*  And there's a baby version of cocaine which is sugar which the rest of America runs on. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4076.98s)]
*  But once you become an adult there is cocaine. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4080.58s)]
*  There's an actual baby version of cocaine. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4082.42s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4083.94s)]
*  I tried to purchase on the dark web. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4084.2599999999998s)]
*  No you didn't. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4086.2599999999998s)]
*  Tell me what it is. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4087.46s)]
*  So you can make tea out of cocoa leaves. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4088.02s)]
*  Oh no, Mark. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4090.5s)]
*  And you can make the tea and it gives you a stimulant. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4091.22s)]
*  No. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4093.62s)]
*  I like cocaine but it's natural. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4094.18s)]
*  This is how they do it in Central America. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4095.62s)]
*  Give me a Zen right now. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4097.38s)]
*  You just got me- [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4098.42s)]
*  You tried to buy cocoa leaves on the dark web. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4098.98s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4101.3s)]
*  For the bit. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4101.94s)]
*  He's ridiculous. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4102.5s)]
*  For the bit. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4103.0599999999995s)]
*  I was looking at it and it was natural. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4103.62s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's America. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4106.42s)]
*  That's how they did it for years. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4107.46s)]

*  Oh how else should you do is snort it up with baby powder in it or whatever the fuck? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4110.5s)]
*  That's not good for you? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4113.86s)]
*  I'm not gonna put fucking baby powder in my cocaine, Mark. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4114.58s)]
*  That's why I did child sacrifice. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4117.78s)]
*  They can get the baby powder to cut it with, bro. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4119.3s)]
*  Listen, guys. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4121.62s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4122.26s)]
*  My fear is that if we wipe the cartels off the face of the earth, which is what Tom Homan just said, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4122.9800000000005s)]
*  we would be in a serious confidence deficit in the United States of America [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4129.14s)]
*  and we would not be able to overcome it. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4133.7s)]
*  We become Democrats. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4135.7s)]
*  We become liberals. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=4136.66s)]

*  There's a fee when you gotta stay away from it. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5266.92s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5268.52s)]
*  There is a relentlessness. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5270.68s)]
*  50 cent. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5272.360000000001s)]
*  50. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5273.160000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5273.88s)]
*  There's a few people that it's just not worth it. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5274.280000000001s)]
*  It is not worth it. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5276.92s)]
*  Especially like Dave's got all the money in the world. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5278.4400000000005s)]
*  So you don't need to do anything. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5280.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5282.6s)]
*  What motivates him? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5282.92s)]
*  But if you give him a reason to wake up. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5283.72s)]
*  I remember seeing the drama happen with this. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5285.56s)]
*  Like there's this country singer named I guess Zach Bryan. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5287.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5291.160000000001s)]
*  He's apparently like a huge country singer. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5292.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He's nice. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5293.72s)]
*  What's the song of this guy? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5294.84s)]
*  I cannot name one song. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5296.04s)]
*  So I listened to the song that he wrote about Chicken Fry's friend. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5296.84s)]
*  He made a song about Chicken Fry's friend? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5301.8s)]
*  It's just such a ridiculous sentence to say. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5304.679999999999s)]
*  Chicken Fry. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5306.5199999999995s)]
*  Cold beer on Friday night. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5307.88s)]
*  No that's not him. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5312.36s)]
*  This guy's like more like. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5313.08s)]
*  Pelle jeans and fish and rice. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5313.88s)]
*  You gotta. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5315.24s)]
*  Chicken's ashy. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5316.2s)]
*  Pink Skies is the one that starts with appropriate chicken. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5316.84s)]
*  That's also Zach. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5319.5599999999995s)]
*  That's Zach Brown. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5320.679999999999s)]
*  But we're talking about Zach Brown. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5321.48s)]
*  So there's a Zach Bryan and then there's a Zach Brown. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5322.52s)]
*  Zach Brown band. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5326.360000000001s)]
*  Band. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5327.64s)]
*  But that Chicken Fry song is fire. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5328.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5330.4400000000005s)]
*  This guy's less like fun party. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5331.240000000001s)]
*  It seems like this guy's more like artsy kind of. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5333.080000000001s)]
*  Well can we play a song of. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5335.320000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5434.52s)]
*  He's like the bear guy. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5435.08s)]
*  Josh Richards. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5437.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5438.6s)]
*  Anyway, so they all do a podcast together and you know once Dave heard that his girl was hurt, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5439.08s)]
*  you know, Dave's gonna ride for his people. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5448.28s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5450.12s)]
*  So Dave came out there, I respect that. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5450.68s)]
*  You gotta ride for the gang. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5452.5199999999995s)]
*  Zach Brian, the dumbest thing you could ever done in your fucking life. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5453.88s)]
*  You gotta learn from the enemies of Dave Portnoy. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5456.76s)]
*  He will not stop until you stop. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5460.36s)]
*  You are destroyed. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5463.48s)]
*  So yeah, her side of the story, I looked into this a bit. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5464.6s)]
*  She told on the pod with Dave is basically they dated, everything was good for a few months, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5467.32s)]
*  and then after like four months, it just got toxic. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5472.28s)]
*  He would get really temperamental out of nowhere. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5474.44s)]
*  And then I think he would pitch like huge fits. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5476.599999999999s)]
*  Like one time she asked him to go to her best friend's grandmother's funeral. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5480.759999999999s)]
*  He caused a huge scene. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5486.04s)]
*  It was basically like, fuck you, I'm not gonna do this. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5487.16s)]
*  Ended up having to go to the funeral and then wrote one of his new massive hits [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5489.5599999999995s)]
*  about going to that funeral about the person he hated, his dead grandmother, whatever. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5493.08s)]
*  So kind of like, if you're the friend, you're like, you treat me like shit. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5498.12s)]
*  Apparently he yelled at that friend, threw like a glass at her head. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5501.0s)]
*  At the funeral? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5503.8s)]
*  And now later, just another holiday. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5504.6s)]
*  That's my bad. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5509.56s)]
*  Yeah, at another holiday, he had all of them over somehow. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5510.12s)]
*  And then chicken fried went to sleep. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=5512.84s)]

*  No, that's not specifically to see feet. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6047.98s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6049.98s)]
*  But this motion, I thought you could do in the privacy of your Instagram feed. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6051.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6056.38s)]
*  But now people are going to know and they don't really know what you're zooming into. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6056.86s)]
*  We should verify this. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6060.0599999999995s)]

*  But anyway, go on. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6065.9s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6066.46s)]
*  I'm safe because all the girls I look at have augmented asses and butts. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6067.5s)]

*  Big tech is just not letting anyone have any more secrets. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6077.26s)]

*  You would have rapped along with him. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6116.22s)]
*  How'd I do? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6117.42s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6118.0599999999995s)]

*  And then you had Dave Portnoy as your next line. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6120.7s)]
*  I was excited for you. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6123.58s)]

*  I think Tyson's gonna demolish it. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6299.1s)]
*  Tyson looks good in the fucking... [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6300.94s)]
*  The cups they put out. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6302.94s)]
*  Who'd you think was gonna win the election? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6304.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it's gonna be Trump. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6306.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6307.58s)]
*  That's right. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6308.78s)]
*  You did say it. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6309.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6309.82s)]
*  I'm actually curious. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6310.86s)]
*  I mean... [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6312.54s)]
*  Tyson is going to murder. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6314.7s)]
*  He's 58. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6316.219999999999s)]
*  He's 60 years old. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6317.099999999999s)]
*  Doing things at 40 is almost impossible. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6319.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how he's gonna do it at 60. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6320.86s)]
*  But there is a different situation where like... [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6323.179999999999s)]
*  This is Jake coming up in weight to fight somebody [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6326.78s)]
*  that's heavier than him. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6330.7s)]
*  Before this, Jake has always been the heavier opponent. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6332.139999999999s)]
*  He's always been the bigger opponent. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6334.7s)]
*  And he's been usually the boxer going up against someone [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6336.0599999999995s)]
*  who's not a boxer. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6339.099999999999s)]
*  Now he's going up against someone who is [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6340.62s)]
*  fighting at their natural weight [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6343.34s)]
*  and has boxed for their entire life. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6345.42s)]
*  But at the same time, Jake is a hard punching guy. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6348.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not worried about Tyson throwing punches at 58. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6352.7s)]
*  I'm worried about, first of all, endurance. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6355.5s)]
*  But second of all, taking punches at 58. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6357.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6359.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a whole different thing. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6359.82s)]
*  Tyson is a different animal, guys. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6361.34s)]
*  Muhammad Ali was a different animal. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6363.42s)]
*  We always describe... [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6364.78s)]
*  He came back and got his ass beat. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6365.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6366.86s)]
*  As whooped by Larry Holmes, I think. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6367.5s)]
*  But Larry Holmes is also the best heavyweight in the world at the time. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6369.179999999999s)]
*  He had been a sparring partner for years. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6371.5s)]
*  He didn't get his ass beat by a bum. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6375.179999999999s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6377.34s)]
*  But that was also... [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6378.219999999999s)]
*  Muhammad Ali at what, 40? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6379.82s)]
*  Was he that old when he did it? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6381.42s)]
*  But he wasn't 58. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6382.54s)]
*  I'm just saying whatever age he was, he wasn't 58. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6384.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6386.7s)]
*  Mike's going to have to get in and he's going to have to land those shots close. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6388.46s)]
*  And we're going to see what happens. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6394.3s)]
*  I mean... [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6395.5s)]
*  Mike is going to fuck him up. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6396.06s)]
*  Really? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6398.3s)]
*  I hope you're right, man. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6398.86s)]
*  I am rooting for Mike. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6400.14s)]
*  I'm a Mike fan. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6401.58s)]
*  I normally like Jake, but obviously I'm rooting for Tyson. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6402.3s)]
*  But I'm fearful, man. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6405.5s)]
*  He's 58. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6407.02s)]
*  I'm very worried about this. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6407.82s)]
*  All the new muscles on Jake is different. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6409.5s)]
*  This is grow man strength. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6412.38s)]
*  He's had this strength forever. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6414.3s)]
*  And his endurance is back. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6415.9800000000005s)]
*  This motherfucker looks... [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6418.7s)]
*  That's a 60 year old man that looks like Keith Ford. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6420.7s)]
*  I mean, with all due respect to Mike, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6423.02s)]
*  I feel like we keep discrediting Jake every single time. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6425.9800000000005s)]
*  And then he keeps doing it and we keep moving the goalpost. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6428.78s)]
*  I gave Jake his props. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6431.9800000000005s)]
*  I think Jake is a good boxer. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6433.1s)]
*  He is. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6434.86s)]
*  For the amount of time he has been boxing. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6435.58s)]
*  I just think Mike is a different animal. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6438.06s)]
*  That's possible. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6441.74s)]
*  But at the same time, age catches up to all of us. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6443.5s)]
*  60 years old is still 60 years old. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6446.86s)]
*  Also, I'm curious, has the nature of boxing changed? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6450.0599999999995s)]
*  Has the style of boxing? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6453.179999999999s)]
*  Is it possible that he, if he's in a groove where he's like, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6454.94s)]
*  look, he fights this way, everyone knows what he does [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6458.219999999999s)]
*  and he's been doing the same thing 30 years. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6460.0599999999995s)]
*  And Jake, despite being more novice, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6462.139999999999s)]
*  is doing something newer, technically speaking. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6464.86s)]
*  This is what I would say. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6467.42s)]
*  Jake just has that overhead right there. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6468.46s)]
*  Jake's got power. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6469.9s)]
*  He's got this great overhand right. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6471.5s)]
*  What I think that Mike will try to do is smother him. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6473.0199999999995s)]
*  And I don't think Jake will have power in the smother. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6476.38s)]
*  He needs a little bit more length and distance [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6481.26s)]
*  to get the shots off. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6483.26s)]
*  But what Jake is good at is catching somebody moving in. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6484.3s)]
*  So if Mike just moves straight in, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6490.139999999999s)]
*  Jake can catch you in short distance with that overhand right. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6493.26s)]
*  And Mike has that good head movement. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6496.62s)]
*  But if Mike is bobbing and weaving on the way in, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6498.219999999999s)]
*  that will be more difficult, of course. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6501.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm sure that he's seen clips of this. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6502.78s)]
*  He's like, OK, I got to watch that when I'm walking in, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6505.34s)]
*  but that's what I'm worried about. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6507.58s)]
*  Mike's also got a great chin. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6509.1s)]
*  They call him Iron Mike Tyson for a reason. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6510.22s)]
*  So I don't think that he's going to feel power. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6512.7s)]
*  And this is no insult to Jake's power. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6515.34s)]
*  But he's not going to feel power he hasn't felt before. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6516.78s)]
*  Like Mike's been there with much harder hitters than Jake. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6518.9400000000005s)]
*  And Jake is a hard-hitting guy. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6522.46s)]
*  You cannot take that away from him. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6524.3s)]
*  But Mike's been in there with the hardest-hitting human beings [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6526.14s)]
*  on the planet, simple as that. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6528.46s)]
*  And he's stood up against it. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6529.9800000000005s)]
*  Jake has never been in the ring with somebody with Mike's power. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6530.78s)]
*  That I can't say just based on his spars. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6534.14s)]
*  I don't know who he's sparring with. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6537.9800000000005s)]
*  OK, he hasn't been in a professional fight with anybody [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6539.9800000000005s)]
*  close to his power. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6543.18s)]
*  That's 100% true. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6543.9s)]
*  And power is the last thing to go, is what I'll say. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6545.42s)]
*  OK, because that's my question. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6547.9800000000005s)]
*  Is a 60-year-old rooting for him? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6549.66s)]
*  60-year-old Mike, does he have that kind of power? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6551.66s)]
*  Power is the last thing to go. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6553.74s)]
*  Mike, if you looked at George Foreman, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6555.5s)]
*  I think George Foreman won the heavyweight title at 50 years old [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6559.26s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6561.5s)]
*  He had like 45 maybe. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6562.22s)]
*  Yeah, we should look that up. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6563.66s)]
*  And he was known as the hardest-hitting puncher alive. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6565.58s)]
*  I think when he fought Joe Frazier, he lifted him in the air on an uppercut. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6570.54s)]
*  So he won the heavyweight championship at 45 years old. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6576.7s)]
*  And I think that's the oldest person that's ever been a heavyweight champion. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6580.9400000000005s)]
*  We're talking about 15 more years or 13 more years after that. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6584.06s)]
*  Mike Tyson. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6587.58s)]
*  Better shape than Frazier was. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6588.62s)]
*  Foreman, yeah. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6590.62s)]
*  Foreman. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6591.74s)]
*  Foreman was. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6592.3s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6592.94s)]
*  But Foreman, what he had was the great equalizer, which was power. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6593.58s)]
*  He could just walk in there, he could take your shots. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6597.98s)]
*  And then when he landed, you went to sleep. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6600.94s)]
*  Mike has always had power, but he's also a volume guy too. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6605.26s)]
*  He's a guy that's going to hit you twice in the body, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6608.219999999999s)]
*  and then the hook comes up top. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6610.62s)]
*  So I think he needs to soften you up and then put you out. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6612.86s)]
*  Like if you look at Mike's greatest knockouts, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6617.0199999999995s)]
*  the third punch clips you and then you're done. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6620.06s)]
*  Whereas Foreman could just stalk, stalk, stalk. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6623.26s)]
*  Boom, one shot, sit you down. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6625.9s)]
*  That's what I think happens in this fight. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6627.34s)]
*  I think Mike's going to get in close, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6629.02s)]
*  Jake's going to feel power for the first time, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6632.9400000000005s)]
*  and he's not going to know what to do with that. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6635.34s)]
*  Because he's overpowered everybody he's been in the ring with, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6636.9400000000005s)]
*  and he's not going to know what to do with that. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6640.06s)]
*  So there's an argument to be made for that, which is, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6641.74s)]
*  and this is a fight that Jake won, he fought Anderson Silva. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6645.02s)]
*  Do you remember when he fought him? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6647.9800000000005s)]
*  He was winning that fight against Anderson Silva, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6649.18s)]
*  but Anderson was smothering him. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6652.06s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6653.58s)]
*  And it was hard for Jake to get off. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6654.46s)]
*  It was hard for Jake to like land shots, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6656.06s)]
*  because Anderson's strategy was kind of get inside. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6658.22s)]
*  And then Jake caught him and dropped him, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6660.46s)]
*  and Jake won the fight. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6662.06s)]
*  He definitely deserved to win. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6662.9400000000005s)]
*  But Anderson was able to control Jake's effectiveness [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6664.780000000001s)]
*  by being on the inside. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6670.3s)]
*  He just wasn't able to score on the inside. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6671.740000000001s)]
*  So the question is, if Mike is on the inside, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6674.3s)]
*  Mike can score on the inside. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6678.46s)]
*  That is Mike's zone. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6679.82s)]
*  So I think Anderson was most, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6683.74s)]
*  I don't even want to know if I would say effective, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6686.0599999999995s)]
*  but like him, look this, like him getting inside, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6687.82s)]
*  like basically being, yeah, he's not throwing any power on it, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6691.58s)]
*  but he's essentially trying to get close enough [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6695.58s)]
*  where Jake can't load up. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6697.42s)]
*  All those insides, so Mike would do a much better job [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6701.1s)]
*  of fighting in the phone booth. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6703.82s)]
*  And generating power. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6707.66s)]
*  Yes, but at the same time, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6709.1s)]
*  you know, Silvo is 42 or something like that, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6710.38s)]
*  Mike is 58 years old. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6712.54s)]
*  It's, dude, time, time is, you get old. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6713.66s)]
*  Here's the hardest thing about being old. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6719.58s)]
*  It's not, it's not just the training. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6721.0199999999995s)]
*  It's that I'm 40 years old. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6725.18s)]
*  I go play paddle. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6726.86s)]
*  I'm fucking sore for two days. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6727.82s)]
*  So the recovery period in order to train effectively at 60 [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6731.1s)]
*  is really tough. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6736.62s)]
*  Are they testing for this? [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6737.82s)]
*  I can't, I hope not. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6739.5s)]
*  I can't fathom. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6741.339999999999s)]
*  Better not, because neither one will pass. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6742.139999999999s)]
*  I can't fathom. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6744.0599999999995s)]
*  That's B-brand. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6744.94s)]
*  Because that would fix your recovery thing. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6747.259999999999s)]
*  Even if you're not necessarily doing it for size, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6749.179999999999s)]
*  but just doing specific enhancements. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6750.7s)]
*  Yeah, or just inflammation. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6754.379999999999s)]
*  What did your friend call it? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6757.179999999999s)]
*  Like the advanced training system or something? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6758.219999999999s)]
*  The initiate vitamin protocol. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6761.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the vitamin protocol. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6764.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6765.26s)]
*  Did you ever do the stem cells for your back? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6767.42s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6769.18s)]
*  I might want to do something for like shoulder, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6770.780000000001s)]
*  but I don't know if it would work. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6772.46s)]
*  Just wait. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6775.66s)]
*  The stem cells, you should just try that shit. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6776.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6777.900000000001s)]
*  Well, I think stem cells work for a specific thing, right? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6778.38s)]
*  I think it's like if there's damage to an area, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6781.26s)]
*  it can rebuild certain things. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6785.1s)]
*  But like stem cells, for example, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6786.38s)]
*  I don't think they'll like, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6787.820000000001s)]
*  they won't just fix your Achilles if it's torn. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6789.18s)]
*  No, but I mean, isn't yours just like... [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6792.7s)]
*  Yeah, so it might be a good candidate for it. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6794.7s)]
*  I just need to look and see if it is, essentially. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6798.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know enough to know what it fixes. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6801.34s)]
*  If it's just simply like recovery from wear and tear, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6805.0199999999995s)]
*  maybe it does it and that'd be great. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6807.26s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6808.94s)]
*  We go to war with the cartel, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6809.74s)]
*  you can't go to tier one and get that shit. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6811.0199999999995s)]
*  I go to Columbia. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6812.54s)]
*  Nah, they siding with cartels. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6815.179999999999s)]
*  They can't wait for Mexico shit to be done, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6817.34s)]
*  then they're back on top. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6819.42s)]
*  What happened to El Salvador? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6821.099999999999s)]
*  They threw everyone in prison. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6822.139999999999s)]
*  And it works. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6823.58s)]
*  Lit, like... [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6824.9400000000005s)]
*  It's lit. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6825.58s)]
*  It turns out if you punish criminals, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6827.820000000001s)]
*  it makes life better. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6829.9800000000005s)]
*  There's another thing, Democrats. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6831.74s)]
*  Break that down. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6834.38s)]
*  So this El Salvadorian president, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6836.06s)]
*  this Bukhele or whatever like that, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6838.3s)]
*  basically anybody who's gang related or in a gang [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6840.14s)]
*  just overnight started sending them to jail. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6844.38s)]
*  And El Salvador, I think, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6847.18s)]
*  went from the most dangerous country in the world [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6848.38s)]
*  to the safest in Central America. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6850.860000000001s)]
*  Committed a crime just by being in the gang. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6854.22s)]
*  Basically, all some RICO shit. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6855.9800000000005s)]
*  83,000 people. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6858.3s)]
*  This is a small country. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6860.860000000001s)]
*  As of November 5, 2024. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6861.66s)]
*  And they have these massive containment centers, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6863.18s)]
*  but they just started locking them up. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6865.58s)]
*  And literally overnight, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6867.740000000001s)]
*  the country changed. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6871.740000000001s)]
*  And now it's the safest country. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6872.9400000000005s)]
*  There's no one left on the street to commit a crime. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6874.54s)]
*  There it is. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6876.780000000001s)]
*  But they also decided to make Bitcoin legal currency [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6878.14s)]
*  and now Bitcoin's at fucking 85. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6881.900000000001s)]
*  He's done some very ambitious changes. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6884.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw people posting about that football player [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6889.02s)]
*  that took CAF's contract. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6891.42s)]
*  Now he's looking good. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6894.06s)]
*  I forgot his name. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6894.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you know the football player? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6895.9800000000005s)]
*  From the 49ers, right? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6897.26s)]
*  You saw the House Hunters episode of Go Firo? [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6898.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, where he wanted to pay with 50,000 Bitcoin. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6901.26s)]
*  Yeah, and it would have been worth like 3.2 billion today [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6903.66s)]
*  or some shit. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6906.46s)]
*  The tricky thing with that is always like, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6907.9800000000005s)]
*  you would have sold. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6911.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6913.18s)]
*  That's how I sleep at night. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6913.740000000001s)]
*  You know the people were like, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6914.860000000001s)]
*  I had 10,000 Bitcoin at one point in time, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6916.06s)]
*  but I sold it for $10,000. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6918.54s)]
*  It's like, you would have sold it [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6921.26s)]
*  when it was worth 100,000 or a million. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6924.62s)]
*  Like you were up so much. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6927.740000000001s)]
*  The people that just hold on to their Bitcoin [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6930.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6942.22s)]
*  There's a certain point where greed takes over [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6943.42s)]
*  and you're like, let me not let this go back down. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6944.9400000000005s)]
*  I could buy a house. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6947.34s)]
*  It seems crazy. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6951.9800000000005s)]
*  You just throw all these people in prison and it's fine? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=6952.780000000001s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7208.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think John Jones gets it done. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7210.96s)]
*  And I think Stipe might have moments [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7212.64s)]
*  where he makes it interesting. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7216.56s)]
*  I think John's going to have to respect Stipe's striking. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7217.52s)]
*  And I mean, Stipe went in there with Daniel Cormier [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7220.88s)]
*  and Daniel Cormier is an amazing legendary wrestler. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7225.92s)]
*  And Stipe was able to find a way to keep it on the feet [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7230.4s)]
*  and eventually get a victory over Daniel. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7232.96s)]
*  So I think that John's going to have to respect Stipe. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7235.52s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be as easy [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7243.52s)]
*  as that zero gun fight where John just walks straight through him. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7244.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7247.36s)]
*  But I think it's hard for you to bet against John Jones. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7248.0s)]
*  I mean, it's fucking John Jones. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7250.32s)]
*  You hear him say that if he wins this, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7251.52s)]
*  he wants to fight not Aspen All-Nex, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7253.52s)]
*  he wants to fight... [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7256.4s)]
*  Parrera. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7257.04s)]
*  Parrera Spadela. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7257.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7258.72s)]
*  That'd be so awesome. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7260.72s)]
*  That'd be so awesome. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7262.8s)]
*  You think he's ducking Aspen All-Nex [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7263.68s)]
*  or you think that's actually the most fun fight? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7264.72s)]
*  John Jones doesn't duck. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7266.16s)]
*  And I respect what Aspen All-Nex is doing in terms of... [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7267.6s)]
*  He's trying to build the fight. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7270.16s)]
*  So he's just saying anything he could say to get people interested. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7271.28s)]
*  But John Jones is not afraid of anybody. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7275.04s)]
*  There's nobody on the planet John Jones is afraid of. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7278.08s)]
*  So the idea that all of a sudden he's afraid of Aspen All-Nex [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7281.52s)]
*  is just absurd. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7285.360000000001s)]
*  Now Aspen All-Nex has got to say something [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7286.32s)]
*  to get excitement for the fight. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7287.92s)]
*  But we're talking about John Jones here. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7290.56s)]
*  It's like saying Tom Brady's afraid of a defense. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7293.280000000001s)]
*  It's like there's no defense Tom Brady's afraid of. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7296.160000000001s)]
*  Tom Brady's the best quarterback who's ever lived. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7298.320000000001s)]
*  He can't wait. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7301.04s)]
*  He's solid. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7301.76s)]
*  He's chomping at the bit to go attack your fucking defense. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7302.320000000001s)]
*  And the proof is that he's got seven championships. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7305.76s)]
*  The proof is that John Jones has been fighting [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7308.400000000001s)]
*  fucking title fights for the last 17 years or whatever. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7310.0s)]
*  He's just an absurdly talented human being. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7312.240000000001s)]
*  So yeah, he's not afraid. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7314.4800000000005s)]
*  But you know. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7317.44s)]
*  What a crazy thing to say. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7320.24s)]
*  I could beat up any human being on earth. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7321.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7323.28s)]
*  What a crazy fucking thought to walk around. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7323.839999999999s)]
*  Literally say it every day. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7325.759999999999s)]
*  The fight, the interest, the really interesting fight [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7332.08s)]
*  is Pereda for sure. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7334.96s)]
*  And then. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7337.12s)]
*  Why is that fight interesting? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7340.08s)]
*  I'm actually curious because to me it's like, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7341.28s)]
*  well, John Jones is so much bigger now [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7342.799999999999s)]
*  that Pereda's power is not going to matter. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7344.639999999999s)]
*  I think they're about the same size. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7347.2s)]
*  And also Pereda's power matters no matter what weight he's in. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7348.32s)]
*  He just knocks people the fuck out. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7351.12s)]
*  So it's like, I just think that Pereda's this incredibly dominant force [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7352.96s)]
*  you're seeing in the UFC is by far the biggest draw right now in the UFC. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7357.44s)]
*  You think he's good enough to take on a heavyweight and the power not? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7362.88s)]
*  Pereda? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7368.08s)]
*  Power still be effective. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7368.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7370.24s)]
*  You also have to understand when the gloves are four ounces [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7371.36s)]
*  and you can punch, you're still going to feel it no matter what weight you're in. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7374.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're going down. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7379.92s)]
*  Like after a certain weight, you're going down. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7380.8s)]
*  Maybe if a guy 125, 135 hits you, 145 hits you, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7383.599999999999s)]
*  maybe you're not going down if you're a big dude. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7387.2s)]
*  But a guy who walks around at 200 plus pounds like Pereda, [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7390.0s)]
*  probably 225, he walks around. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7393.28s)]
*  He loses weight to get down when he was fighting a middleweight at 185 [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7395.599999999999s)]
*  or when he's fighting at 205 or whatever it is. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7399.36s)]
*  He has to drain. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7401.2s)]
*  On fight night, he's 225. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7402.48s)]
*  So he is heavy. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7405.759999999999s)]
*  He's 6'4". [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7408.08s)]
*  And he's taller than that. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7410.4s)]
*  I actually think that John Jones will be the smaller man that night in the ring. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7415.28s)]
*  Because John has put on all this weight. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7420.5599999999995s)]
*  Alex's body hasn't changed at all. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7422.48s)]
*  If you look at his frame, he's just depleting with water. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7425.919999999999s)]
*  Now he's just added more muscle, which is muscle that really wants to be there. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7428.639999999999s)]
*  We haven't seen anybody be able to wrestle Pereda. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7431.92s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7434.64s)]
*  So John is going... [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7435.12s)]
*  But John, also when I spoke to him at the Sphere, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7437.36s)]
*  we were sitting next to each other at the Sphere pretty much. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7440.64s)]
*  His brothers were there as well. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7443.4400000000005s)]
*  And one of the things that he said that he likes to do is he likes to specifically go [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7445.12s)]
*  at a person with their strength. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7450.16s)]
*  So if you are known for striking, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7453.04s)]
*  he wants to outstrike you because of the mind game that that puts you in. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7455.2s)]
*  It's like if I beat you at the thing you thought you were better than me, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7458.88s)]
*  you've checked out of this fight. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7462.4800000000005s)]
*  It's over for you now. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7464.8s)]
*  You're in deep water. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7465.6s)]
*  You know you can't do the other things better than me. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7466.4800000000005s)]
*  Fucking confidence that takes. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7468.64s)]
*  Oh, and yeah, it's also just strategy. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7470.08s)]
*  Strategy, but again, you got to be effective enough to pull it off. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7472.08s)]
*  Let's go against the best striker and outstrike him and then just break him. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7475.68s)]
*  It's that fucking Drago shit in Rocky IV. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7478.4800000000005s)]
*  I want to break him. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7481.52s)]
*  Oh, break it. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7482.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7483.4400000000005s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7483.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, I think it'd be just an unbelievable... [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7484.96s)]
*  Like that is the biggest spectacle in fighting. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7488.08s)]
*  Another big fight I think would be awesome would be like Drikis Duplessis, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7490.88s)]
*  the guy who would be Izzy versus Hamzat Chamayev. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7494.32s)]
*  So this guy Hamzat Chamayev just beat Robert Whitaker. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7501.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be good. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7504.719999999999s)]
*  Now, the fight, if we're going by like who deserves to be next, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7506.48s)]
*  Sean Strickland deserves a rematch based on what's on paper. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7511.679999999999s)]
*  But this isn't the Olympics. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7515.36s)]
*  Like this isn't like the amateurs. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7517.36s)]
*  Who the next person gets to fight is the person who makes it the most exciting version of it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7520.4800000000005s)]
*  We've seen the Sean Strickland-Drikis fight. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7524.0s)]
*  It was all right. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7526.0s)]
*  It's cool. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7526.56s)]
*  Like excitement wise, it's not like... [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7527.120000000001s)]
*  You got to respect the guys going in there, but [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7529.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think anybody with eyeballs that watches fighting looks at that fight and goes, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7531.92s)]
*  whoa, this is exciting. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7535.76s)]
*  He's watching Alex Pereira knock somebody the fuck out. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7536.96s)]
*  He's like, okay, they're point fighting and they showed a lot of heart. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7539.84s)]
*  And it was... [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7542.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's different when you go see somebody take someone's head off. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7543.200000000001s)]
*  And or when you see you got like Homsot literally 10 seconds shoot on what's his face [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7547.2s)]
*  and choke him to the point where like his lower teeth pushed in and he had to tap out of pain. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7553.84s)]
*  So seeing those two guys go at it, I think is the more exciting thing. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7561.28s)]
*  And this is the game of prize fighting. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7566.08s)]
*  So if the prize looks bigger, that's what... [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7567.68s)]
*  Welcome to America. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7570.56s)]
*  Welcome to capitalism. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7571.4400000000005s)]
*  Like if you don't support that, you just don't support capitalism, plain and simple. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7572.320000000001s)]
*  So you just don't understand how business works. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7575.12s)]
*  So if you're a businessman, if you're a capitalist, if you understand the American way, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7579.28s)]
*  you probably want to see Drikas fight Homsot. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7583.84s)]
*  If you want what is fair and what has earned, you see Drikas fight Strickland. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7589.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're more of a communist or a socialist. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7596.48s)]
*  If you're more of a socialist and you believe in like equal outcomes and like what is... [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7600.5599999999995s)]
*  What is fair and whatever, that's fine. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7605.84s)]
*  But if you're a capitalist and you're an American, then you would obviously... [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7607.6s)]
*  I kind of fight with both, I'll be honest. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7611.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7613.76s)]

*  That's what you are. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7633.2s)]
*  You want DEI. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7633.6s)]
*  You want diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7634.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7637.6s)]
*  You want the less exciting fight that's going to make less money for the company [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7638.400000000001s)]
*  and go against capitalist values just because that person worked really hard [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7641.04s)]

*  That's the opposite of DEI. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7646.88s)]
*  You want DEI. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7647.84s)]
*  No. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7649.120000000001s)]

*  Another. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7679.52s)]
*  You want a theater. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7680.08s)]

*  I totally understand what you're saying. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7682.08s)]
*  We should sacrifice what the public wants. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7683.6s)]
*  We should... [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7685.4400000000005s)]
*  Just so you can have your little fantasy. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7685.92s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7687.52s)]

*  Keep going. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7689.68s)]
*  You want a theater, bro. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7690.240000000001s)]
*  Castro felt the same way. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7691.120000000001s)]
*  And I think that it's a really good... [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7692.24s)]
*  I think he probably had some good ideas. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7693.679999999999s)]
*  100%. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7695.44s)]

*  Castro's still alive. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7696.88s)]
*  Still kicking it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7698.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7698.8s)]
*  No, he died. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7699.5199999999995s)]
*  It's all right. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7700.0s)]
*  Trudeau, right? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7702.48s)]
*  Trudeau. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7703.36s)]
*  He's true. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7703.76s)]
*  Now, I also say this as a Floyd Mayweather fan [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7705.5199999999995s)]
*  that watched very unentertaining fights for some people for decades. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7708.4s)]
*  Because they didn't appreciate... [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7715.28s)]
*  They wanted a fucking knockout, which they should. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7717.12s)]
*  I'm a super fan of boxing, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7719.36s)]
*  so I liked watching this guy who was just the best at what he did. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7720.56s)]
*  This is how you learn the lesson. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7723.84s)]
*  You don't want to see the fair fight. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7725.52s)]
*  Now it seems like you're on my side. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7727.4400000000005s)]
*  No, it is an unfortunate thing because I imagine if you're an MMA fighter, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7730.080000000001s)]
*  you're up and coming MMA fighter, you're like, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7734.0s)]
*  okay, I could play this safer and be undefeated, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7735.6s)]
*  but I might never get that title shot. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7739.6s)]
*  The guys who are getting knocked out [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7742.080000000001s)]
*  might get the title shot before me because people are going to pay to see them. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7744.8s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's like, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7748.320000000001s)]
*  that's the tricky thing about being the UFC. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7750.240000000001s)]
*  It's like you want to go, hey, this is a fair system [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7751.76s)]
*  where if somebody earns the title shot, they get it. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7754.4800000000005s)]
*  But you also want to communicate to the fighters, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7756.56s)]
*  the way you earn it is by exciting the fuck out of the fans. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7758.240000000001s)]
*  You don't earn it by playing it safe. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7763.04s)]
*  And to your point, Floyd had to put on this bad guy persona [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7765.76s)]
*  so he could sell tickets because you want to see him lose. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7769.76s)]
*  Because his fight style is kind of boring to watch if you're casual. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7771.92s)]
*  Not kind of. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7775.200000000001s)]
*  If you're casual, it's very boring. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7775.68s)]
*  So how do I get them to be interested? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7777.52s)]
*  Because I still need to sell tickets. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7779.36s)]
*  I got to play the bad guy. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7781.12s)]
*  UFC doesn't seem like those guys are as inclined to do that. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7782.4s)]
*  So make the fight exciting. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7785.12s)]
*  And I think, again, as a casual could be, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7786.4800000000005s)]
*  when he wrestled, I was like, this is exciting. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7788.4s)]
*  It was just so relentless. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7790.0s)]
*  Well, there are some people that are so relentless that you're like, I got to watch. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7790.88s)]
*  The fight of the night shit helps that. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7793.76s)]
*  You see a Max Holloway be like, yo, I'll watch like I fight him. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7795.76s)]
*  Anytime. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7799.28s)]
*  I don't care what happens. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7800.16s)]
*  Anytime. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7801.12s)]
*  So yeah, I think that's and that's just the nature of the game. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7802.4800000000005s)]
*  We got to respect it. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7805.68s)]
*  If we love America. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7806.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7807.52s)]
*  Oh, also, if you love America and you want to bet on the US largest social security, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7808.4800000000005s)]
*  what is that? [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7812.240000000001s)]
*  Social casino. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7812.64s)]
*  Social casino. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7813.280000000001s)]
*  And get a gift basket. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7814.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7815.280000000001s)]
*  What is in this gift basket? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7815.92s)]
*  Place your bets at stake, dude. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7816.64s)]
*  That's for you to find out. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7817.92s)]
*  What's in it, bro? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7819.360000000001s)]
*  Stake, dog. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7820.160000000001s)]
*  Just put the gift basket. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7820.8s)]
*  No, no. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZmZNVTOfs&t=7823.280000000001s)]
